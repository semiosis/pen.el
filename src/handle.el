;;; Commentary:
;; A handle for major-mode generic functions.

;; `handle' provides generic functions that specialize on major modes
;; and intended purpose instead of arguments.  Similar functionality is
;; needed across programming languages such as:

;; - evaluating expressions
;; - starting repls
;; - finding documentation
;; - going to definition
;; - formatting code
;; - compiling code
;; - listing errors

;; But this functionality is performed by different callables across
;; major modes and often by multiple callables in the same
;; one.  `handle' groups them together so that they can be bound to a
;; single global `kbd', selected based on major mode, and run in
;; sequence until one succeeds.

;;; Code:
(require 'parent-mode)
