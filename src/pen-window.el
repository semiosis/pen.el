   "Display BUFFER in the selected window.
ALIST is an association list of action symbols and values.  See
Info node `(elisp) Buffer Display Action Alists' for details of
such alists.

This function fails if ALIST has an `inhibit-same-window'
element whose value is non-nil, or if the selected window is a
minibuffer window or is dedicated to another buffer; in that case,
return nil.  Otherwise, return the selected window.

This is an action function for buffer display, see Info
node `(elisp) Buffer Display Action Functions'.  It should be
called only by `display-buffer' or a function directly or
indirectly called by the latter."
