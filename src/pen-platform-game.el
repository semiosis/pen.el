;; Plan:

;; I want:
;; - ASCII graphics with animations as objects represented in EIEIO.
;; - A canvas, which may redraw according to a timer.

;; Objects:
;; - canvas
;; - animation


;; Hmm.. Maybe this would be a good candidate for using j:gamegrid
;; I could have a similar scale to, say CK1 or DUKE1 which is slightly closer

(provide 'pen-platform-game)
