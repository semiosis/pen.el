chaining
    [#prompt engineering]

    http://gptprompts.wikidot.com/chaining:chaining

    API results into one another: The results
    of one API call can be processed and fed
    back into another API call with a
    different prompt to expand the potential
    capabilities of a workflow.
        
    While OpenAI API has a lot of capabilities
    on its own, it is limited to 2000
    characters per prompt.
    
    This puts a need to be able to determine
    optimal types of prompt selection and
    examples included in the prompt for
    complex queries.
    
    Rather than try to do everything at once,
    subtasks can be delegated to different API
    calls with subtask-optimized prompts.
    
    I don't know if there's a better term for
    this, so I'm tentatively calling this
    behavior chaining and can change this if
    it turns out there's a better name.
    
    Chaining ends up boiling down into a
    couple different tasks.
    
    First, you need to figure out what a
    prompt is actually asking for.
    
    To do this you can decompose the task into
    its component parts and figure out the
    sort of prompts you need to query to
    answer the parts http://gptprompts.wikidot.com/chaining:using-the-fringe.
    
    For each of those sub-parts, you need to
    be able to figure out how to optimize the
    prompt so that it optimizes the answer via
    context stuffing
    http://gptprompts.wikidot.com/context-stuffing.
    
    However, during all of this, you want to
    make sure that you're ensuring that the
    API is in compliance with safety practices
    for your task
    http://gptprompts.wikidot.com/safety.
    
context-stuffing
    [#prompt engineering]

    With only 2048 tokens, you need to make
    use of your real estate by providing
    instructions and making implicit
    information explicit.

benchmarking
    [#prompt engineering]

    A single prompt getting a good response
    once might be enough for your use case,
    but generally we want to know how well
    different solutions hold up on a variety
    of use cases.
    
    Also important to understand where prompts
    designs outperform others.

explicit bias
    [#ai safety]

    Where output is clearly toxic (cursing,
    slander).

implicit bias
    [#ai safety]

    Where the policy from the output changes
    based on context (e.g. opposition to
    programs that help certain groups,
    probabilities about roles).
