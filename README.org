* =Pen.el= (a holy OS)
Pen.el is a free and holy OS made with emacs, debian linux and docker.

It's free because it's libre and gratis.
It's holy because:
- It's designed to be used by Christians who wish to maintain holiness in their computing.
  - reduce the cognitive dissonance when trying to remain focused on God while using a computer
    - free from distractions
  - support all areas of their Christian faith.
    - praying
    - praising
    - running churches
    - maintaining holiness
  - integrates lots of Christian resources in a more powerful way than through websites.
- I also have a policy of avoiding AI fiction - AI fiction is considered unholy.

holiness
- set-apart for God

y:holiness

This project is purposed to support Christians with their
computing, including Bible-study, prayers, holiness, and otherwise just
enabling people to be focused on God, even while using a computer.

  holiness
      The state of being holy.
      "a life of holiness and total devotion to
      God"

      Set-apart from the world, and drawing
      nearer to God.

      A life of discipline, focus, and attention
      to matters of righteous living.

      It is, as Paul states in Romans 12:1-2, a
      life fully presented to God in a way that
      transforms our lives to God's glory rather
      than conforming our lives to the ways of
      the world.

      Romans 12:1-2
        Therefore, I urge you, brothers and
        sisters, in view of God’s mercy, to
        offer your bodies as a living sacrifice,
        holy and pleasing to God—this is your
        true and proper worship. 2 Do not
        conform to the pattern of this world,
        but be transformed by the renewing of
        your mind. Then you will be able to test
        and approve what God’s will is—his good,
        pleasing and perfect will.

** Technical details
- It runs in a docker container.
- It's primarily text-based.

** Aims
The major aim of Pen.el is to be a holy
operating system, providing the user with free (but advanced) Bible study
software and trustworthy Christian resources that are all offline.

It's intended to be a self-sufficient text-based computing environment that does not require
the internet, and making it easier to maintain one's Christian faith by eliminating all the distractions,
yet being feature-full and fun.

# Included are all the benefits that come from using emacs.
# Pen.el is like an opinionated emacs distribution.

Pen.el is both an operating system and the Christian / Bible software that runs it.

Using Pen.el, there should be no need to go online, as it should contain everything you need to be content with your computing.
The Bible-software is indented to be as featureful as any of the other options available, but completely free, and also low maintenance.

It's also designed to be a Christian's operating system.

It's a project that has no forseeable expiry date.

** Intended users
- emacs/linux savvy pastors, chaplains
- theology students
- anyone wanting software that respects a user's desire to remain holy

** Quick installation
