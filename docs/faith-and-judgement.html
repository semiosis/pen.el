<p>
<b>Revelation of John 14:12</b> - Here is a call for the endurance of the saints, those who keep the commandments of God and their faith in Jesus.
</p>

<p>
I read this as 'A saint is someone who has faith in Jesus AND keeps the commandments (pursuing by faith, not works)'.
I read this as the Great commandments, 10 Commandments and faith in Jesus Christ, and potentially various other commandments from the Mosaic law if you now about them, or whatever subset a person practices.
But the law should be pursued by faith and not by works.
</p>

<p>
<b>John 15:10</b> - If you keep my commandments, you will abide in my love, just as I have kept my Father's commandments and abide in his love.
</p>

<p>
<b>Romans 9:30-32</b> - What shall we say, then? That Gentiles who did not pursue righteousness have attained it, that is, a righteousness that is by faith; but that Israel who pursued a law that would lead to righteousness did not succeed in reaching that law. Why? Because they did not pursue it by faith, but as if it were based on works. They have stumbled over the stumbling stone, (ESV)
</p>

<p>
Jesus' commandments don't contradict the rest of the commandments.
</p>

<p>
Also God's commandments (especially the 10 Commandments; loving God and your neighbour) are still binding on us - written on our heart when we get born-again.
</p>

<p>
<b>Deuteronomy 4:13</b> - And he declared to you his covenant, which he commanded you to perform, that is, the Ten Commandments, and he wrote them on two tablets of stone.
</p>

<p>
<b>Romans 10:5</b> - For Moses writes about the righteousness that is based on the law, that the person who does the commandments shall live by them.
</p>

<p>
<b>Romans 13:9</b> - The commandments, You shall not commit adultery, You shall not murder, You shall not steal, You shall not covet, and any other commandment, are summed up in this word: You shall love your neighbor as yourself.
</p>

<p>
There's no contradiction.
</p>

<p>
However, we must submit to God's righteousness through faith in Jesus Christ.
</p>

<p>
The Mosaic law is not abolished but Jesus fulfilled it like a prophesy.
</p>

<p>
The righteousness we have through faith in Jesus Christ is needed whether someone keeps the Mosaic law or not.
Not that I keep the Mosaic law, nor are circumcised.
</p>

<p>
<b>Romans 10:3-4</b> - For, being ignorant of the righteousness that comes from God, and seeking to establish their own, they did not submit to God's righteousness. For Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to everyone who believes.
</p>

<p>
This is why we are not <b>under</b> the law because we have the righteousness that comes through faith in Christ.
</p>

<p>
But we are under the law of faith in Christ.
And we are supposed to keep the commandments by pursuing them in faith.

<div id="outline-container-org41bdf4c" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org41bdf4c"><span class="section-number-2">4.</span> Jesus fulfilled the law</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-4">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Who gave Moses the law and the instructions to build the tabernacle? God did.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The blueprints came from God.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The Law, the Psalms and the Prophets all point to Jesus.</li>
<li>Moses wrote about Jesus.</li>
<li>Jesus fulfilled the Law and the prophesies.</li>
</ul>

<p>
We still follow the law but by faith and not by works.
</p>

<p>
We keep accountability with God, and in truth over following the law - God knows when we lie, cheat, commit adultery, idolise etc.
We follow the law in truth.
Jesus fulfilled the law. Jesus' blood is the atonement for sin.
So we go to Jesus for forgiveness instead of perform the ceremonial law to try to make atonement for sin.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-4-1">
<p>
<b>Matthew 19:17-21</b> - And he said to him, Why do you ask me about what is good? There is only one who is good. If you would enter life, keep the commandments.  He said to him, Which ones? And Jesus said, You shall not murder, You shall not commit adultery, You shall not steal, You shall not bear false witness, Honor your father and mother, and, You shall love your neighbor as yourself.  The young man said to him, All these I have kept. What do I still lack?  Jesus said to him, If you would be perfect, go, sell what you possess and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; and come, follow me.
</p>

<p>
<b>Romans 13:9</b> - The commandments, You shall not commit adultery, You shall not murder, You shall not steal, You shall not covet, and any other commandment, are summed up in this word: You shall love your neighbor as yourself.
</p>

<p>
<b>Galatians 5:14</b> - For the whole law is fulfilled in one word: You shall love your neighbor as yourself.
</p>

<p>
<b>James 2:8-13</b> - If you really fulfill the royal law according to the Scripture, You shall love your neighbor as yourself, you are doing well.  But if you show partiality, you are committing sin and are convicted by the law as transgressors.  For whoever keeps the whole law but fails in one point has become accountable for all of it.  For he who said, Do not commit adultery, also said, Do not murder. If you do not commit adultery but do murder, you have become a transgressor of the law.  So speak and so act as those who are to be judged under the law of liberty.  For judgment is without mercy to one who has shown no mercy. Mercy triumphs over judgment.
</p>

<p>
<b>Romans 2:13</b> - For it is not the hearers of the law who are righteous before God, but the doers of the law who will be justified. (ESV)

<b>Romans 3:31</b> - Do we then overthrow the law by this faith? By no means! On the contrary, we uphold the law. (ESV)

I Peter 2:6-25: For it stands in Scripture: Behold, I am laying in Zion a stone, a cornerstone chosen and precious, and whoever believes in him will not be put to shame.  So the honor is for you who believe, but for those who do not believe, The stone that the builders rejected has become the cornerstone, and A stone of stumbling, and a rock of offense. They stumble because they disobey the word, as they were destined to do.  But you are a chosen race, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people for his own possession, that you may proclaim the excellencies of him who called you out of darkness into his marvelous light.  Once you were not a people, but now you are God's people; once you had not received mercy, but now you have received mercy.  Beloved, I urge you as sojourners and exiles to abstain from the passions of the flesh, which wage war against your soul.  Keep your conduct among the Gentiles honorable, so that when they speak against you as evildoers, they may see your good deeds and glorify God on the day of visitation.  Be subject for the Lord's sake to every human institution, whether it be to the emperor as supreme, or to governors as sent by him to punish those who do evil and to praise those who do good.  For this is the will of God, that by doing good you should put to silence the ignorance of foolish people.  Live as people who are free, not using your freedom as a cover-up for evil, but living as servants of God.  Honor everyone. Love the brotherhood. Fear God. Honor the emperor.  Servants, be subject to your masters with all respect, not only to the good and gentle but also to the unjust.  For this is a gracious thing, when, mindful of God, one endures sorrows while suffering unjustly.  For what credit is it if, when you sin and are beaten for it, you endure? But if when you do good and suffer for it you endure, this is a gracious thing in the sight of God.  For to this you have been called, because Christ also suffered for you, leaving you an example, so that you might follow in his steps.  He committed no sin, neither was deceit found in his mouth.  When he was reviled, he did not revile in return; when he suffered, he did not threaten, but continued entrusting himself to him who judges justly.  He himself bore our sins in his body on the tree, that we might die to sin and live to righteousness. By his wounds you have been healed.  For you were straying like sheep, but have now returned to the Shepherd and Overseer of your souls.

God spoke to Abraham first, and then Abraham believed God.
</p>

<p>
But God made the first move.
The first move from Abraham was belief.
</p>

<p>
The Lord God spoke first - this itself is a gift.
</p>

<p>
Faith involves:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Obedience</li>
<li>Loyalty (faithfulness to God)</li>
<li>God rewarded Abram with a promise</li>
<li>Abram believed God</li>
<li>God counted Abram's belief as righteousness</li>
</ul>

<p>
<b>Genesis 12:1</b> - Now the Lord said to Abram, Go from your country and your kindred and your father's house to the land that I will show you.
</p>

<p>
Abraham <b>obeyed</b> God.
</p>

<p>
<b>Genesis 12:4</b> - So Abram went, as the Lord had told him, and Lot went with him. Abram was seventy-five years old when he departed from Haran.
</p>

<p>
God promised him something, and gave Abram an instruction.
</p>

<p>
<b>Genesis 13:14</b> - The Lord said to Abram, after Lot had separated from him, Lift up your eyes and look from the place where you are, northward and southward and eastward and westward, for all the land that you see I will give to you and to your offspring forever.  I will make your offspring as the dust of the earth, so that if one can count the dust of the earth, your offspring also can be counted. Arise, walk through the length and the breadth of the land, for I will give it to you.
</p>

<p>
Abram obeyed.
</p>

<p>
<b>Genesis 13:18</b> - So Abram moved his tent and came and settled by the oaks of Mamre, which are at Hebron, and there he built an altar to the Lord.
</p>

<p>
Abram interacted with Melchizedek, priest of God Most High, blessed by God Most High.
</p>

<p>
<b>Genesis 14:18-20</b> - And Melchizedek king of Salem brought out bread and wine. (He was priest of God Most High. ) And he blessed him and said, Blessed be Abram by God Most High, Possessor of heaven and earth; and blessed be God Most High, who has delivered your enemies into your hand! And Abram gave him a tenth of everything.
</p>

<p>
Abram, in an act of faith with faithfulness, displayed loyalty to God.
</p>

<p>
<b>Genesis 14:21-24</b> - And the king of Sodom said to Abram, Give me the persons, but take the goods for yourself.  But Abram said to the king of Sodom, I have lifted my hand to the Lord, God Most High, Possessor of heaven and earth, that I would not take a thread or a sandal strap or anything that is yours, lest you should say, I have made Abram rich.  I will take nothing but what the young men have eaten, and the share of the men who went with me. Let Aner, Eshcol, and Mamre take their share.
</p>

<p>
God noticed and gave Abram a vision and made a promise to Abram, and Abram believed God and God counted it to Abram as righteousness.
</p>

<p>
<b>Genesis 15:1</b> - After these things the word of the Lord came to Abram in a vision: Fear not, Abram, I am your shield; your reward shall be very great.  But Abram said, O Lord God, what will you give me, for I continue childless, and the heir of my house is Eliezer of Damascus?  And Abram said, Behold, you have given me no offspring, and a member of my household will be my heir.  And behold, the word of the Lord came to him: This man shall not be your heir; your very own son shall be your heir.  And he brought him outside and said, Look toward heaven, and number the stars, if you are able to number them. Then he said to him, So shall your offspring be.  And he believed the Lord, and he counted it to him as righteousness.

<b>Genesis 15:1</b> - After these things the word of the Lord came to Abram in a vision: Fear not, Abram, I am your shield; your reward shall be very great.  But Abram said, O Lord God, what will you give me, for I continue childless, and the heir of my house is Eliezer of Damascus?  And Abram said, Behold, you have given me no offspring, and a member of my household will be my heir.  And behold, the word of the Lord came to him: This man shall not be your heir; your very own son shall be your heir.  And he brought him outside and said, Look toward heaven, and number the stars, if you are able to number them. Then he said to him, So shall your offspring be.  And he believed the Lord, and he counted it to him as righteousness.
</p>

<p>
<i><b>Conviction.</b></i>
</p>

<p>
<b>Hebrews 11:17-19</b> - By faith Abraham, when he was tested, offered up Isaac, and he who had received the promises was in the act of offering up his only son, of whom it was said, Through Isaac shall your offspring be named. He considered that God was able even to raise him from the dead, from which, figuratively speaking, he did receive him back.
</p>

<p>
Like Abraham, a believer's faith may be tested.
</p>

<p>
<i><b>Trust in God.</b></i>,
</p>

<p>
<i><b>Fear of God.</b></i>,
</p>

<p>
<i><b>Testable faith.</b></i>
</p>

<p>
<b>Genesis 22:9-14</b> - When they came to the place of which God had told him, Abraham built the altar there and laid the wood in order and bound Isaac his son and laid him on the altar, on top of the wood.  Then Abraham reached out his hand and took the knife to slaughter his son.  But the angel of the Lord called to him from heaven and said, Abraham, Abraham! And he said, Here am I.  He said, Do not lay your hand on the boy or do anything to him, for now I know that you fear God, seeing you have not withheld your son, your only son, from me.  And Abraham lifted up his eyes and looked, and behold, behind him was a ram, caught in a thicket by his horns. And Abraham went and took the ram and offered it up as a burnt offering instead of his son.  So Abraham called the name of that place, The Lord will provide; as it is said to this day, On the mount of the Lord it shall be provided.
</p>

<p>
<i><b>Holding onto the promise, even to death if required.</b></i>
</p>

<p>
<b>Hebrews 11:13</b> - These all died in faith, not having received the things promised, but having seen them and greeted them from afar, and having acknowledged that they were strangers and exiles on the earth.
</p>

<p>
Like Abraham, a believer keeps the faith right to the end of their life or until Jesus takes them home.
</p>

<p>
<i><b>Patient endurance / waiting on God (belief * time).</b></i>
</p>

<p>
We should have <b>busy</b> (non-sluggish) faith,
and imitate the faith of people such as
Abraham, so that we inherit the promises.
We can believe those promises which we inherit.
</p>

<p>
<b>Hebrews 6:12-15</b> - so that you may not be sluggish, but imitators of those who through faith and patience inherit the promises.  For when God made a promise to Abraham, since he had no one greater by whom to swear, he swore by himself, saying, Surely I will bless you and multiply you.  And thus Abraham, having patiently waited, obtained the promise.
</p>

<p>
<b>Revelation of John 3:8</b> - I know your works. Behold, I have set before you an open door, which no one is able to shut. I know that you have but little power, and yet you have kept my word and have not denied my name.  Behold, I will make those of the synagogue of Satan who say that they are Jews and are not, but lie—behold, I will make them come and bow down before your feet and they will learn that I have loved you.  Because you have kept my word about <b>patient endurance</b>, I will keep you from the hour of trial that is coming on the whole world, to try those who dwell on the earth.

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-5-1-2">
<p>
<b>Matthew 21:32</b> - For John came to you in the way of righteousness, and you did not believe him, but the tax collectors and the prostitutes believed him. And even when you saw it, you did not afterward change your minds and believe him. (ESV)
</p>

<p>
To follow the law by faith, I think, is to not lie, commit adultery, idolize, etc. in truth and reality, keeping yourself accountable to God.
</p>

<p>
This is the key, I think, to following the law by faith: <b>praise from God and not men</b>
</p>

<p>
<b>Romans 2:29</b> - But he is a Jew who is one inwardly; and circumcision is that which is of the heart, by the Spirit, not by the letter; and his praise is not from men, but from God.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>John the baptist taught 'turn from sin and believe in the One to come'.</li>
<li>Jesus taught to 'come to and believe in Him (Jesus) for forgiveness and stop sinning'.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Stopping sinning is important from either angle.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The apostles also taught people to turn from sin, believe and stop sinning.</li>
</ul>

<p>
<b>John 5:14</b> - Afterward Jesus found him in the temple and said to him, See, you are well! Sin no more, that nothing worse may happen to you.
</p>

<p>
Examples of receiving forgiveness from Jesus.
</p>

<p>
<b>Matthew 9:2</b> - And behold, some people brought to him a paralytic, lying on a bed. And when Jesus saw their faith, he said to the paralytic, Take heart, my son; your sins are forgiven.
</p>

<p>
Forgiven after Jesus saw their faith.
</p>

<p>
<b>Mark 2:5</b> - And when Jesus saw their faith, he said to the paralytic, My son, your sins are forgiven.
</p>

<p>
Acts of faith.
</p>

<p>
<b>Matthew 9:5</b> - For which is easier, to say, Your sins are forgiven, or to say, <b>Rise and walk?</b>
</p>

<p>
<b>Mark 2:9</b> - Which is easier, to say to the paralytic, Your sins are forgiven, or to say, <b>Rise, take up your bed and walk?</b>
</p>

<p>
Turning.

<p>
<b>Mark 4:11-12</b> - And he said to them, To you has been given the secret of the kingdom of God, but for those outside everything is in parables, so that they may indeed see but not perceive, and may indeed hear but not understand, lest they should <b>turn</b> and be forgiven.
</p>

<b>Matthew 19:4-9</b> - He answered, Have you not read that he who created them from the beginning made them male and female, and said, Therefore a man shall leave his father and his mother and hold fast to his wife, and they shall become one flesh? So they are no longer two but one flesh. What therefore God has joined together, let not man separate. They said to him, Why then did Moses command one to give a certificate of divorce and to send her away? He said to them, Because of your hardness of heart Moses allowed you to divorce your wives, but from the beginning it was not so. And I say to you: whoever divorces his wife, except for sexual immorality, and marries another, commits adultery. (ESV)
</p>

<p>
<b>Matthew 5:14-20</b> - You are the light of the world. A city set on a hill cannot be hidden. Nor do people light a lamp and put it under a basket, but on a stand, and it gives light to all in the house. In the same way, let your light shine before others, so that they may see your good works and give glory to your Father who is in heaven. Do not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them. For truly, I say to you, until heaven and earth pass away, not an iota, not a dot, will pass from the Law until all is accomplished. Therefore whoever relaxes one of the least of these commandments and teaches others to do the same will be called least in the kingdom of heaven, but whoever does them and teaches them will be called great in the kingdom of heaven. For I tell you, unless your righteousness exceeds that of the scribes and Pharisees, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven. (ESV)

I think faith is like casting a net to receive something.

<p>
If you want to catch something big then you need a lot of faith.

<p>
Faith receives salvation, and salvation is the gift which is received through faith.
Faith is something which a person must have to receive the free gift.
The onus is on us to receive the free gift.
</p>

<p>
We must approach Jesus.
We must repent (change our minds, turning from our wicked ways, and turn to God) and obey God.
God has said many things, about his statutes and about how we should listen to Jesus.
I think repentance (from the heart turning from sin) is still approaching Jesus because Jesus fulfilled the law.

<p>
Humble yourself and obey God's commandments (not out of pride, but out of authentic faith with God, being accountable to God, in secret).
Trying to turn from sin in truth and reality.

This is my current understanding. Is this correct?

<p>
I 100% believe that anyone who puts faith in Jesus Christ for their righteousness can be saved. But that doesn't mean they inherit the Kingdom.
</p>

<p>
Also, the Kingdom stretches from heaven to earth, so gay 'marriage' may happen on earth but such a thing could never exist in heaven.
</p>

<p>
But neither does marriage between man and woman even exist in heaven.

<p>
But those who practice sexual impurity which includes homosexuality wont <b>inherit</b> the kingdom - that's for the saints (those who keep God's commandments AND have faith in Jesus).

<p>
This is honestly just the starting point.
</p>

<p>
Continuing to believe that Jesus is the Messiah and the Only-begotten Son of God is enough to get saved, but it's not enough to be counted a disciple of Jesus.
</p>

<p>
And it's 'saved' but 'being saved' at the same time.
</p>

<p>
One wants to progress to having Jesus abide inside them.
</p>

<p>
I think that rejects His commandments but claiming to believe in Jesus Christ as the Son of God is an extremely precarious, and tentative position to be in,
and may indicate that the person doesn't <b>really</b> believe.
</p>

<p>
And if a person doesn't believe in reality, then that person probably isn't saved - so they are only lying to themself that they are saved.

When the young man heard this he went away sorrowful, for he had great possessions.  And Jesus said to his disciples, Truly, I say to you, only with difficulty will a rich person enter the kingdom of heaven.  Again I tell you, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich person to enter the kingdom of God.  When the disciples heard this, they were greatly astonished, saying, Who then can be saved?  But Jesus looked at them and said, With man this is impossible, but with God all things are possible.  Then Peter said in reply, See, we have left everything and followed you. What then will we have?  Jesus said to them, Truly, I say to you, in the new world, when the Son of Man will sit on his glorious throne, you who have followed me will also sit on twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.  And everyone who has left houses or brothers or sisters or father or mother or children or lands, for my name's sake, will receive a hundredfold and will inherit eternal life.

As the Father has loved me, so have I loved you. Abide in my love.  If you keep my commandments, you will abide in my love, just as I have kept my Father's commandments and abide in his love.  These things I have spoken to you, that my joy may be in you, and that your joy may be full.  This is my commandment, that you love one another as I have loved you.  Greater love has no one than this, that someone lays down his life for his friends.  You are my friends if you do what I command you.  No longer do I call you servants, for the servant does not know what his master is doing; but I have called you friends, for all that I have heard from my Father I have made known to you.  You did not choose me, but I chose you and appointed you that you should go and bear fruit and that your fruit should abide, so that whatever you ask the Father in my name, he may give it to you.  These things I command you, so that you will love one another.  If the world hates you, know that it has hated me before it hated you.  If you were of the world, the world would love you as its own; but because you are not of the world, but I chose you out of the world, therefore the world hates you.  Remember the word that I said to you: A servant is not greater than his master. If they persecuted me, they will also persecute you. If they kept my word, they will also keep yours.  But all these things they will do to you on account of my name, because they do not know him who sent me.  If I had not come and spoken to them, they would not have been guilty of sin, but now they have no excuse for their sin.  Whoever hates me hates my Father also.  If I had not done among them the works that no one else did, they would not be guilty of sin, but now they have seen and hated both me and my Father.  But the word that is written in their Law must be fulfilled: They hated me without a cause.  But when the Helper comes, whom I will send to you from the Father, the Spirit of truth, who proceeds from the Father, he will bear witness about me.  And you also will bear witness, because you have been with me from the beginning.

<b>Romans 11</b> - I ask, then, has God rejected his people? By no means! For I myself am an Israelite, a descendant of Abraham, a member of the tribe of Benjamin. God has not rejected his people whom he foreknew. Do you not know what the Scripture says of Elijah, how he appeals to God against Israel? Lord, they have killed your prophets, they have demolished your altars, and I alone am left, and they seek my life. But what is God's reply to him? I have kept for myself seven thousand men who have not bowed the knee to Baal. So too at the present time there is a remnant, chosen by grace. But if it is by grace, it is no longer on the basis of works; otherwise grace would no longer be grace. What then? Israel failed to obtain what it was seeking. The elect obtained it, but the rest were hardened, as it is written, God gave them a spirit of stupor, eyes that would not see and ears that would not hear, down to this very day. And David says, Let their table become a snare and a trap, a stumbling block and a retribution for them; let their eyes be darkened so that they cannot see, and bend their backs forever. So I ask, did they stumble in order that they might fall? By no means! Rather through their trespass salvation has come to the Gentiles, so as to make Israel jealous. Now if their trespass means riches for the world, and if their failure means riches for the Gentiles, how much more will their full inclusion mean! Now I am speaking to you Gentiles. Inasmuch then as I am an apostle to the Gentiles, I magnify my ministry in order somehow to make my fellow Jews jealous, and thus save some of them. For if their rejection means the reconciliation of the world, what will their acceptance mean but life from the dead? If the dough offered as firstfruits is holy, so is the whole lump, and if the root is holy, so are the branches. But if some of the branches were broken off, and you, although a wild olive shoot, were grafted in among the others and now share in the nourishing root of the olive tree, do not be arrogant toward the branches. If you are, remember it is not you who support the root, but the root that supports you. Then you will say, Branches were broken off so that I might be grafted in. That is true. They were broken off because of their unbelief, but you stand fast through faith. So do not become proud, but stand in awe. For if God did not spare the natural branches, neither will he spare you. Note then the kindness and the severity of God: severity toward those who have fallen, but God's kindness to you, provided you continue in his kindness. Otherwise you too will be cut off. And even they, if they do not continue in their unbelief, will be grafted in, for God has the power to graft them in again. For if you were cut from what is by nature a wild olive tree, and grafted, contrary to nature, into a cultivated olive tree, how much more will these, the natural branches, be grafted back into their own olive tree. Lest you be wise in your own conceits, I want you to understand this mystery, brothers: a partial hardening has come upon Israel, until the fullness of the Gentiles has come in. And in this way all Israel will be saved, as it is written, The Deliverer will come from Zion, he will banish ungodliness from Jacob; and this will be my covenant with them when I take away their sins. As regards the gospel, they are enemies of God for your sake. But as regards election, they are beloved for the sake of their forefathers. For the gifts and the calling of God are irrevocable. Just as you were at one time disobedient to God but now have received mercy because of their disobedience, so they too have now been disobedient in order that by the mercy shown to you they also may now receive mercy. For God has consigned all to disobedience, that he may have mercy on all. Oh, the depth of the riches and wisdom and knowledge of God! How unsearchable are his judgments and how inscrutable his ways! For who has known the mind of the Lord, or who has been his counselor? Or who has given a gift to him that he might be repaid? For from him and through him and to him are all things. To him be glory forever. Amen. (ESV)

<b>Matthew 12:33-37</b> -  Either make the tree good and its fruit good, or make the tree bad and its fruit bad, for the tree is known by its fruit.  You brood of vipers! How can you speak good, when you are evil?  For out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks.  The good person out of his good treasure brings forth good, and the evil person out of his evil treasure brings forth evil.  I tell you, on the day of judgment people will give account for every careless word they speak, for by your words you will be justified, and by your words you will be condemned.  (ESV)

<b>I John 3:4-11</b> - Everyone who makes a practice of sinning also practices lawlessness; sin is lawlessness.  You know that he appeared to take away sins, and in him there is no sin.  No one who abides in him keeps on sinning; no one who keeps on sinning has either seen him or known him.  Little children, let no one deceive you. Whoever practices righteousness is righteous, as he is righteous.  Whoever makes a practice of sinning is of the devil, for the devil has been sinning from the beginning. The reason the Son of God appeared was to destroy the works of the devil.  No one born of God makes a practice of sinning, for God's seed abides in him, and he cannot keep on sinning because he has been born of God.  By this it is evident who are the children of God, and who are the children of the devil: whoever does not practice righteousness is not of God, nor is the one who does not love his brother.  For this is the message that you have heard from the beginning, that we should love one another.

Amen.  For this reason God gave them up to dishonorable passions.  For their women exchanged natural relations for those that are contrary to nature; and the men likewise gave up natural relations with women and were consumed with passion for one another, men committing shameless acts with men and receiving in themselves the due penalty for their error.  And since they did not see fit to acknowledge God, God gave them up to a debased mind to do what ought not to be done.  They were filled with all manner of unrighteousness, evil, covetousness, malice.  They are full of envy, murder, strife, deceit, maliciousness.  They are gossips, slanderers, haters of God, insolent, haughty, boastful, inventors of evil, disobedient to parents, foolish, faithless, heartless, ruthless.

I personally do not endorse gay marriage. When I have in the past, I repent of that. That is not to say it is not possible to endorse it yourself but a person is accountable to God for that act of annulling one of His commandments.

</p>

<p>
I believe one must know that God's law is right and when presented with God's law, they recognise that the law is right and recognise their transgression.

And no-one should endorse sinful things. Homosexuality is erroneous.
If they do, however, endorse it then I think that inhibits them from approaching God.

If a newly born-again Christian is spending all their time with sinners though and endorsing continually instead of being discipled, then they can

<b>Acts 23:3</b> - Then Paul said to him, God is going to strike you, you whitewashed wall! Are you sitting to judge me according to the law, and yet contrary to the law you order me to be struck?
</p>

<p>
<b>Matthew 12:3-8</b> - He said to them, Have you not read what David did when he was hungry, and those who were with him: how he entered the house of God and ate the bread of the Presence, which it was not lawful for him to eat nor for those who were with him, but only for the priests?  Or have you not read in the Law how on the Sabbath the priests in the temple profane the Sabbath and are guiltless?  I tell you, something greater than the temple is here.  And if you had known what this means, I desire mercy, and not sacrifice, you would not have condemned the guiltless.  For the Son of Man is lord of the Sabbath.
</p>

<p>
The greatest among you will be your servant.
Keeping the commandments by faith results in a person a who is a servant, serving others.
</p>

<p>
<b>Luke 22:26</b> - But it is not this way with you, but the one who is the greatest among you must become like the youngest, and the leader like the servant.
</p>

<p>
<b>Matthew 5:19</b> - Therefore whoever relaxes one of the least of these commandments and teaches others to do the same will be called least in the kingdom of heaven, but whoever does them and teaches them will be called great in the kingdom of heaven.
</p>

<p>
Not the best example, but, for example, when someone says you owe them money, and you can see they are blind, it's paying them because you're the one submitting to God.
It's humbling yourself even to others and following God's commandments in truth and reality, with a real faith relationship with God.
It's serving others as Jesus has served us.
It's keeping accountable to God and maintaining faithfulness to God, not keeping others accountable to you.
</p>

<p>
This isn't self-righteousness, but is a self-sacrificial obedience to continue working as a bond-servant of Christ, being the light of the world.

<b>Matthew 5:17-25</b> - Do not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them.

Therefore whoever relaxes one of the least of these commandments and teaches others to do the same will be called least in the kingdom of heaven, but whoever does them and teaches them will be called great in the kingdom of heaven. For I tell you, unless your righteousness exceeds that of the scribes and Pharisees, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven. You have heard that it was said to those of old, You shall not murder; and whoever murders will be liable to judgment. But I say to you that everyone who is angry with his brother will be liable to judgment; whoever insults his brother will be liable to the council; and whoever says, You fool! will be liable to the hell of fire. So if you are offering your gift at the altar and there remember that your brother has something against you, leave your gift there before the altar and go. First be reconciled to your brother, and then come and offer your gift. Come to terms quickly with your accuser while you are going with him to court, lest your accuser hand you over to the judge, and the judge to the guard, and you be put in prison. (ESV)

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-7-3-1">
<p>
When a person is born-again of the Spirit, they receive the Spirit which helps them to stop sinning. It's really important to stop sinning.
</p>

<p>
<b>1 John 5:18</b> -  We know that everyone who has been born of God does not keep on sinning, but he who was born of God protects him, and the evil one does not touch him.  (ESV)
</p>

<p>
<b>Ezekiel 11:19-20</b> - And I will give them one heart, and a new spirit I will put within them.

And they shall be my people, and I will be their God. (ESV)
</p>

<p>
<b>I John 3:9</b> - No one born of God makes a practice of sinning, for God's seed abides in him, and he cannot keep on sinning because he has been born of God.
</p>

<p>
But I would much like my dream life to be like the following:
</p>

<p>
<b>John 5:19</b> - So Jesus said to them, Truly, truly, I say to you, the Son can do nothing of his own accord, but only what he sees the Father doing. For whatever the Father does, that the Son does likewise.
</p>

<p>
Whoever loves in the way Jesus loved us and the way Jesus commanded us has been born of God and knows God.
</p>

<p>
<b>I John 4:7</b> - Beloved, let us love one another, for love is from God, and whoever loves has been born of God and knows God.
</p>

<p>
Anyone who <b>truly believes</b>.
</p>

<p>
<b>I John 5:1</b> - Everyone who believes that Jesus is the Christ has been born of God, and everyone who loves the Father loves whoever has been born of him.
</p>

<p>
<b>I John 5:4</b> - For everyone who has been born of God overcomes the world. And this is the victory that has overcome the world—our faith.
</p>

<p>
<b>I John 5:18</b> - We know that everyone who has been born of God does not keep on sinning, but he who was born of God protects him, and the evil one does not touch him.
</p>

<p>
I feel like stopping sin is very important after being born again.
</p>

<p>
<b>John 5:14</b> - Afterward Jesus found him in the temple and said to him, See, you are well! Sin no more, that nothing worse may happen to you.

<p>
<b>Romans 8:30</b> - And those whom he predestined he also called, and those whom he called he also justified, and those whom he justified he also glorified. (ESV)
</p>

<p>
But repentance is a work of the heart which is an act of faith.
I believe repentance is inseparable from faith because intrinsic to faith is belief and intrinsic to belief is metanoia (changing one's mind).
</p>

<p>
At it's most basic form repentance means a person believes in Jesus as the Son of God and the Messiah who, being innocent, paid the price for their sin through His broken body and shed blood on the cross - a perfect and eternal offering; that He died there but God resurrected Him, and He is Lord of Heaven and Earth.
</p>

<p>
But I believe we are forgiven to forgive others. That must be part of the act of faith and the change of heart, I think.

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-7-6-2">
<p>
<b>James 2:10</b> - For whoever keeps the whole law but fails in one point has become accountable for all of it.  For he who said, Do not commit adultery, also said, Do not murder. If you do not commit adultery but do murder, you have become a transgressor of the law.  So speak and so act as those who are to be judged under the law of liberty.  For judgment is without mercy to one who has shown no mercy. Mercy triumphs over judgment.  What good is it, my brothers, if someone says he has faith but does not have works? Can that faith save him?  If a brother or sister is poorly clothed and lacking in daily food, and one of you says to them, Go in peace, be warmed and filled, without giving them the things needed for the body, what good is that?  So also faith by itself, if it does not have works, is dead.  But someone will say, You have faith and I have works. Show me your faith apart from your works, and I will show you my faith by my works.  You believe that God is one; you do well. Even the demons believe—and shudder!  Do you want to be shown, you foolish person, that faith apart from works is useless?  Was not Abraham our father justified by works when he offered up his son Isaac on the altar?  You see that faith was active along with his works, and faith was completed by his works; and the Scripture was fulfilled that says, Abraham believed God, and it was counted to him as righteousness—and he was called a friend of God.  You see that a person is justified by works and not by faith alone.
</p>

<p>
I tend to agree with James on this.
Eliminating works from faith is not good.
</p>

<p>
Works:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>obedience</li>
<li>faithfulness
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>keeping God's commandments</li>
</ul></li>
<li>trust</li>

<li>response of love

</ul></li>
<li>humility
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>keeping God's commandments</li>
</ul></li>
<li>patient endurance (time)</li>
</ul>

<p>
If a person believes that Jesus Christ is the Son of the Living God then they abide in Christ.
But do they <b>really</b> believe? Because if they don't <b>really</b> believe it deep down then but are lying to themself they may not abide in Christ at all.
How can a person believe without having a relationship with God? A relationship involves more than belief.
</p>

<p>
If a person does not have obedience, trust and
repentance from sin, but their faith has belief, then they only
abide in Jesus extremely precariously, and also that person's 'faith' probably wont receive much at all from God.
</p>

<p>
Faith = Belief * truth * obedience * faithfulness * fear-of-God * response-of-love * patient-endurance(time)
</p>

<p>
These things are factors of faith.
God is the judge.

<p>

<b>Luke 6:47-49</b> - Everyone who comes to me and hears my words and does them, I will show you what he is like: he is like a man building a house, who dug deep and laid the foundation on the rock.

But the one who hears and does not do them is like a man who built a house on the ground without a foundation. When the stream broke against it, immediately it fell, and the ruin of that house was great.
</p>

<p>
<b>Matthew 7:24-27</b> - Everyone then who hears these words of mine and does them will be like a wise man who built his house on the rock. And the rain fell, and the floods came, and the winds blew and beat on that house, but it did not fall, because it had been founded on the rock. And everyone who hears these words of mine and does not do them will be like a foolish man who built his house on the sand. And the rain fell, and the floods came, and the winds blew and beat against that house, and it fell, and great was the fall of it. (ESV)
