I've been thinking about belief, faith, works, law and receiving the Holy Spirit!
Please let me know what you think if you have the time.

I'm trying to get clearer on this.
Please feel free to discuss it with me.

</p>

<p>
What I like about the didache is that it still upholds righteous living and following God's Great commandments and precepts.
I think it's important to live righteously out of love for God and one's neighbour, and out of faith, but not out of striving for justification.

<h2 id="org416059f"><span class="section-number-2">3.</span> Commandments and faith</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-3">
<p>
<b>Revelation of John 14:12</b> - Here is a call for the endurance of the saints, those who keep the commandments of God and their faith in Jesus.
</p>

<p>
I read this as 'A saint is someone who has faith in Jesus AND keeps the commandments (pursuing by faith, not works)'.
I read this as the Great commandments, 10 Commandments and faith in Jesus Christ, and potentially various other commandments from the Mosaic law if you now about them, or whatever subset a person practices.
But the law should be pursued by faith and not by works.
</p>

<p>
<b>John 15:10</b> - If you keep my commandments, you will abide in my love, just as I have kept my Father's commandments and abide in his love.
</p>

<p>
<b>Romans 9:30-32</b> - What shall we say, then? That Gentiles who did not pursue righteousness have attained it, that is, a righteousness that is by faith; but that Israel who pursued a law that would lead to righteousness did not succeed in reaching that law. Why? Because they did not pursue it by faith, but as if it were based on works. They have stumbled over the stumbling stone, (ESV)
</p>

<p>
Jesus' commandments don't contradict the rest of the commandments.
</p>

<p>
Also God's commandments (especially the 10 Commandments; loving God and your neighbour) are still binding on us - written on our heart when we get born-again and after being born-again we follow them in Spirit.
</p>

<p>
Jesus fulfilled the law =&gt; We have the Spirit of Christ =&gt; We are led by the Spirit and naturally want to follow the law in faith but the world opposes us.
But we don't pursue the law by works. We are freed from the law to serve God.
</p>

<p>
<b>Romans 7:6</b> -  But now we are released from the law, having died to that which held us captive, so that we serve not under the old written code but in the new life of the Spirit.  (ESV)
</p>

<p>
This is still following the law but in faith and in Spirit, not being under the law.
</p>

<p>
<b>Deuteronomy 4:13</b> - And he declared to you his covenant, which he commanded you to perform, that is, the Ten Commandments, and he wrote them on two tablets of stone.
</p>

<p>
<b>Romans 10:5</b> - For Moses writes about the righteousness that is based on the law, that the person who does the commandments shall live by them.
</p>

<p>
<b>Romans 13:9</b> - The commandments, You shall not commit adultery, You shall not murder, You shall not steal, You shall not covet, and any other commandment, are summed up in this word: You shall love your neighbor as yourself.
</p>

<p>
There's no contradiction.
</p>

<p>
However, we must submit to God's righteousness through faith in Jesus Christ.
</p>

<p>
The Mosaic law is not abolished but Jesus fulfilled it like a prophesy.
</p>

<p>
The righteousness we have through faith in Jesus Christ is needed whether someone keeps the Mosaic law or not.
Not that I keep the Mosaic law in its entirety, nor are circumcised. But I try to keep the Great commandments
and the 10 Commandments out of faith (and a relationship with God) and follow parts of the Mosaic law,
but I have faith in Jesus Christ for the righteousness that comes through faith because I need that because my own
righteousness will never be enough without faith in Jesus for God's righteousness imputed to me.
</p>

<p>
Thank You God.
</p>

<p>
<b>Ephesians 2:8</b> -  For by grace you have been saved through faith.  And this is not your own doing; it is the gift of God,  (ESV)
</p>

<p>
AMEN!!
</p>

<p>
<b>Galatians 2:17</b> &#x2013; But if, in our endeavor to be justified in Christ, we too were found to be sinners, is Christ then a servant of sin? Certainly not! (ESV)
</p>

<p>
AMEN!!
</p>

<p>
<b>Romans 10:3-4</b> - For, being ignorant of the righteousness that comes from God, and seeking to establish their own, they did not submit to God's righteousness. For Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to everyone who believes.
</p>

<p>
This is why we are not <b>under</b> the law because we have the righteousness that comes through faith in Christ.
</p>

<p>
But we are under the law of faith in Christ.
And we are supposed to keep the commandments by pursuing them in faith.

<li>The Law, the Psalms and the Prophets all point to Jesus.</li>
<li>Moses wrote about Jesus.</li>
<li>Jesus fulfilled the Law and the prophesies.</li>
</ul>

<p>
We still follow the law but by faith and not by works.
</p>

<p>
We keep accountability with God, and in truth over following the law - God knows when we lie, cheat, commit adultery, idolise etc.
We follow the law in truth.
Jesus fulfilled the law. Jesus' blood is the atonement for sin.
So we go to Jesus for forgiveness instead of perform the ceremonial law to try to make atonement for sin.

<b>Matthew 19:17-21</b> - And he said to him, Why do you ask me about what is good? There is only one who is good. If you would enter life, keep the commandments.  He said to him, Which ones? And Jesus said, You shall not murder, You shall not commit adultery, You shall not steal, You shall not bear false witness, Honor your father and mother, and, You shall love your neighbor as yourself.  The young man said to him, All these I have kept. What do I still lack?  Jesus said to him, If you would be perfect, go, sell what you possess and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; and come, follow me.
</p>

<p>
<b>Romans 13:9</b> - The commandments, You shall not commit adultery, You shall not murder, You shall not steal, You shall not covet, and any other commandment, are summed up in this word: You shall love your neighbor as yourself.
</p>

<p>
<b>Galatians 5:14</b> - For the whole law is fulfilled in one word: You shall love your neighbor as yourself.
</p>

<p>
<b>James 2:8-13</b> - If you really fulfill the royal law according to the Scripture, You shall love your neighbor as yourself, you are doing well.  But if you show partiality, you are committing sin and are convicted by the law as transgressors.  For whoever keeps the whole law but fails in one point has become accountable for all of it.  For he who said, Do not commit adultery, also said, Do not murder. If you do not commit adultery but do murder, you have become a transgressor of the law.  So speak and so act as those who are to be judged under the law of liberty.  For judgment is without mercy to one who has shown no mercy. Mercy triumphs over judgment.

<b>I Peter 2:6-25</b> - For it stands in Scripture: Behold, I am laying in Zion a stone, a cornerstone chosen and precious, and whoever believes in him will not be put to shame.  So the honor is for you who believe, but for those who do not believe, The stone that the builders rejected has become the cornerstone, and A stone of stumbling, and a rock of offense. They stumble because they disobey the word, as they were destined to do.  But you are a chosen race, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people for his own possession, that you may proclaim the excellencies of him who called you out of darkness into his marvelous light.  Once you were not a people, but now you are God's people; once you had not received mercy, but now you have received mercy.  Beloved, I urge you as sojourners and exiles to abstain from the passions of the flesh, which wage war against your soul.  Keep your conduct among the Gentiles honorable, so that when they speak against you as evildoers, they may see your good deeds and glorify God on the day of visitation.  Be subject for the Lord's sake to every human institution, whether it be to the emperor as supreme, or to governors as sent by him to punish those who do evil and to praise those who do good.  For this is the will of God, that by doing good you should put to silence the ignorance of foolish people.  Live as people who are free, not using your freedom as a cover-up for evil, but living as servants of God.  Honor everyone. Love the brotherhood. Fear God. Honor the emperor.  Servants, be subject to your masters with all respect, not only to the good and gentle but also to the unjust.  For this is a gracious thing, when, mindful of God, one endures sorrows while suffering unjustly.  For what credit is it if, when you sin and are beaten for it, you endure? But if when you do good and suffer for it you endure, this is a gracious thing in the sight of God.  For to this you have been called, because Christ also suffered for you, leaving you an example, so that you might follow in his steps.  He committed no sin, neither was deceit found in his mouth.  When he was reviled, he did not revile in return; when he suffered, he did not threaten, but continued entrusting himself to him who judges justly.  He himself bore our sins in his body on the tree, that we might die to sin and live to righteousness. By his wounds you have been healed.  For you were straying like sheep, but have now returned to the Shepherd and Overseer of your souls.

God and Abram (Abraham) had a real relationship first.
</p>

<p>
God spoke to Abram first, and then Abram <b>obeyed</b>.
Abraham was faithful.
God noticed Abram's faithfulness, and told Abram he would be rewarded.
God gave Abram a promise.
Abram believed God.
</p>

<p>
But God made the first move.
The first move from Abraham was obedience, followed by belief.
</p>

<p>
The Lord God spoke first - this itself is a gift. We have the Bible and the testimony of others as a gift from God.
We must then believe what is said in the Holy Scriptures and trust it and obey it (put into practice).
</p>

<p>
The Holy Spirit goes to those who obey God.
</p>

<p>
<b>Acts 5:32</b> - And we are witnesses to these things, and so is the Holy Spirit, whom God has given to those who obey him. (ESV)
</p>

<p>
Faith involves:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Obedience</li>
<li>Loyalty (faithfulness to God)</li>
<li>God rewarded Abram with a promise</li>
<li>Abram believed God</li>
<li>God counted Abram's belief as righteousness</li>
</ul>

<p>
<b>Genesis 12:1</b> - Now the Lord said to Abram, Go from your country and your kindred and your father's house to the land that I will show you.
</p>

<p>
Abraham <b>obeyed</b> God.
</p>

<p>
<b>Genesis 12:4</b> - So Abram went, as the Lord had told him, and Lot went with him. Abram was seventy-five years old when he departed from Haran.
</p>

<p>
God promised him something, and gave Abram an instruction.
</p>

<p>
<b>Genesis 13:14</b> - The Lord said to Abram, after Lot had separated from him, Lift up your eyes and look from the place where you are, northward and southward and eastward and westward, for all the land that you see I will give to you and to your offspring forever.  I will make your offspring as the dust of the earth, so that if one can count the dust of the earth, your offspring also can be counted. Arise, walk through the length and the breadth of the land, for I will give it to you.
</p>

<p>
Abram obeyed.
</p>

<p>
<b>Genesis 13:18</b> - So Abram moved his tent and came and settled by the oaks of Mamre, which are at Hebron, and there he built an altar to the Lord.
</p>

<p>
OBEDIENCE!
</p>

<p>
<b>Hebrews 5:9-10</b> - And being made perfect, he became the source of eternal salvation to all who <b>obey</b> him, being designated by God a high priest after the order of Melchizedek.
</p>

<p>
Abram interacted with Melchizedek, priest of God Most High, blessed by God Most High. Abram was faithful to God even when God wasn't speaking directly to Him. God can see everything though.
</p>

<p>
<b>Genesis 14:18-20</b> - And Melchizedek king of Salem brought out bread and wine. (He was priest of God Most High. ) And he blessed him and said, Blessed be Abram by God Most High, Possessor of heaven and earth; and blessed be God Most High, who has delivered your enemies into your hand! And Abram gave him a tenth of everything.
</p>

<p>
Abram, in an act of faith with faithfulness, displayed loyalty to God. Abram wanted to prove it will be God who has empowered future blessing which Abram has faith about.
</p>

<p>
<b>Genesis 14:21-24</b> - And the king of Sodom said to Abram, Give me the persons, but take the goods for yourself.  But Abram said to the king of Sodom, I have lifted my hand to the Lord, God Most High, Possessor of heaven and earth, that I would not take a thread or a sandal strap or anything that is yours, lest you should say, I have made Abram rich.  I will take nothing but what the young men have eaten, and the share of the men who went with me. Let Aner, Eshcol, and Mamre take their share.
</p>

<p>
God noticed and gave Abram a vision and made a promise to Abram, and Abram believed God and God counted it to Abram as righteousness.
</p>

<p>
<b>Genesis 15:1</b> - After these things the word of the Lord came to Abram in a vision: Fear not, Abram, I am your shield; your reward shall be very great.  But Abram said, O Lord God, what will you give me, for I continue childless, and the heir of my house is Eliezer of Damascus?  And Abram said, Behold, you have given me no offspring, and a member of my household will be my heir.  And behold, the word of the Lord came to him: This man shall not be your heir; your very own son shall be your heir.  And he brought him outside and said, Look toward heaven, and number the stars, if you are able to number them. Then he said to him, So shall your offspring be.  And he believed the Lord, and he counted it to him as righteousness.

<h4 id="orgfad2ff7"><span class="section-number-4">5.1.1.</span> Faith and works - they overlap and are <b>not</b> mutually exclusive!</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-5-1-1">
<p>
<b>James 2:22-25</b> - You see that faith was active along with his works, and faith was completed by his works; and the Scripture was fulfilled that says, Abraham believed God, and it was counted to him as righteousness—and he was called a friend of God.  You see that a person is justified by works and not by faith alone.  And in the same way was not also Rahab the prostitute justified by works when she received the messengers and sent them out by another way?
</p>

<p>
Anyone who thinks that <b>everyone</b> is saved by faith without any 'work' is kidding themself!
Because they eliminate even continued belief because patient endurance is a work!
There would be no saints.
But I think God can save a person who has belief without work because God is sovereign to save in this way.
</p>

<p>
Anyway, see Revelation and you will see Jesus points out different works for different churches.
</p>

<p>
<b>Revelation of John 2:2</b> - I know your works, your toil and your patient endurance, and how you cannot bear with those who are evil, but have tested those who call themselves apostles and are not, and found them to be false.
</p>

<p>
<b>Revelation of John 2:5</b> - Remember therefore from where you have fallen; repent, and do the works you did at first. If not, I will come to you and remove your lampstand from its place, unless you repent.
</p>

<p>
<b>Revelation of John 2:6</b> - Yet this you have: you hate the works of the Nicolaitans, which I also hate.
</p>

<p>
<b>Revelation of John 2:19</b> - I know your works, your love and faith and service and patient endurance, and that your latter works exceed the first.
</p>

<p>
<b>Revelation of John 2:22-23</b> - Behold, I will throw her onto a sickbed, and those who commit adultery with her I will throw into great tribulation, unless they repent of her works, and I will strike her children dead. And all the churches will know that I am he who searches mind and heart, and <b>I will give to each of you as your works deserve</b>.
</p>

<p>
<b>Revelation of John 3:1-2</b> - And to the angel of the church in Sardis write: The words of him who has the seven spirits of God and the seven stars. I know your works. You have the reputation of being alive, but you are dead. Wake up, and strengthen what remains and is about to die, for I have not found your works complete in the sight of my God.
</p>

<p>
<b>Revelation of John 3:8</b> - I know your works. Behold, I have set before you an open door, which no one is able to shut. I know that you have but little power, and yet you have kept my word and have not denied my name.
</p>

<p>
<b>Revelation of John 3:15</b> - I know your works: you are neither cold nor hot. Would that you were either cold or hot!

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-5-1-2">
<p>
<i><b>Obeying God.</b></i>
</p>

<p>
<b>Hebrews 11:8</b> - By faith Abraham obeyed when he was called to go out to a place that he was to receive as an inheritance. And he went out, not knowing where he was going.
</p>

<p>
<b>Genesis 12:1-3</b> - Now the LORD said to Abram, Go from your country and your kindred and your father's house to the land that I will show you. And I will make of you a great nation, and I will bless you and make your name great, so that you will be a blessing. I will bless those who bless you, and him who dishonors you I will curse, and in you all the families of the earth shall be blessed. (ESV)
</p>

<p>
<i><b>Believing God.</b></i>
</p>

<p>
<b>Genesis 15:1</b> - After these things the word of the Lord came to Abram in a vision: Fear not, Abram, I am your shield; your reward shall be very great.  But Abram said, O Lord God, what will you give me, for I continue childless, and the heir of my house is Eliezer of Damascus?  And Abram said, Behold, you have given me no offspring, and a member of my household will be my heir.  And behold, the word of the Lord came to him: This man shall not be your heir; your very own son shall be your heir.  And he brought him outside and said, Look toward heaven, and number the stars, if you are able to number them. Then he said to him, So shall your offspring be.  And he believed the Lord, and he counted it to him as righteousness.
</p>

<p>
<i><b>Conviction.</b></i>
</p>

<p>
<b>Hebrews 11:17-19</b> - By faith Abraham, when he was tested, offered up Isaac, and he who had received the promises was in the act of offering up his only son, of whom it was said, Through Isaac shall your offspring be named. He considered that God was able even to raise him from the dead, from which, figuratively speaking, he did receive him back.
</p>

<p>
Like Abraham, a believer's faith may be tested.
</p>

<p>
<i><b>Trust in God.</b></i>,
</p>

<p>
<i><b>Fear of God.</b></i>,
</p>

<p>
<i><b>Testable faith.</b></i>
</p>

<p>
<b>Genesis 22:9-14</b> - When they came to the place of which God had told him, Abraham built the altar there and laid the wood in order and bound Isaac his son and laid him on the altar, on top of the wood.  Then Abraham reached out his hand and took the knife to slaughter his son.  But the angel of the Lord called to him from heaven and said, Abraham, Abraham! And he said, Here am I.  He said, Do not lay your hand on the boy or do anything to him, for now I know that you fear God, seeing you have not withheld your son, your only son, from me.  And Abraham lifted up his eyes and looked, and behold, behind him was a ram, caught in a thicket by his horns. And Abraham went and took the ram and offered it up as a burnt offering instead of his son.  So Abraham called the name of that place, The Lord will provide; as it is said to this day, On the mount of the Lord it shall be provided.
</p>

<p>
<i><b>Holding onto the promise, even to death if required.</b></i>
</p>

<p>
<b>Hebrews 11:13</b> - These all died in faith, not having received the things promised, but having seen them and greeted them from afar, and having acknowledged that they were strangers and exiles on the earth.
</p>

<p>
Like Abraham, a believer keeps the faith right to the end of their life or until Jesus takes them home.
</p>

<p>
<i><b>Patient endurance / waiting on God (belief * time).</b></i>
</p>

<p>
We should have <b>busy</b> (non-sluggish) faith,
and imitate the faith of people such as
Abraham, so that we inherit the promises.
We can believe those promises which we inherit.
</p>

<p>
<b>Hebrews 6:12-15</b> - so that you may not be sluggish, but imitators of those who through faith and patience inherit the promises.  For when God made a promise to Abraham, since he had no one greater by whom to swear, he swore by himself, saying, Surely I will bless you and multiply you.  And thus Abraham, having patiently waited, obtained the promise.
</p>

<p>
<b>Revelation of John 3:8</b> - I know your <b>works</b>. Behold, I have set before you an open door, which no one is able to shut. I know that you have but little power, and yet you have <b>kept my word and have not denied my name</b>.  Behold, I will make those of the synagogue of Satan who say that they are Jews and are not, but lie—behold, I will make them come and bow down before your feet and they will learn that I have loved you.  Because you have kept my word about <b>patient endurance</b>, I will keep you from the hour of trial that is coming on the whole world, to try those who dwell on the earth.

<p>
<b>Matthew 21:32</b> - For John came to you in the way of righteousness, and you did not believe him, but the tax collectors and the prostitutes believed him. And even when you saw it, you did not afterward change your minds and believe him. (ESV)
</p>

<p>
To follow the law by faith, I think, is to not lie, commit adultery, idolize, etc. in truth and reality, keeping yourself accountable to God.
</p>

<p>
This is the key, I think, to following the law by faith: <b>praise from God and not men</b>
</p>

<p>
<b>Romans 2:29</b> - But he is a Jew who is one inwardly; and circumcision is that which is of the heart, by the Spirit, not by the letter; and his praise is not from men, but from God.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>John the baptist taught 'turn from sin and believe in the One to come'.</li>
<li>Jesus taught to 'come to and believe in Him (Jesus) for forgiveness and stop sinning'.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Stopping sinning is important from either angle.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The apostles also taught people to turn from sin, believe and stop sinning.</li>
</ul>

<p>
<b>John 5:14</b> - Afterward Jesus found him in the temple and said to him, See, you are well! Sin no more, that nothing worse may happen to you.
</p>

<p>
<b>Ezekiel 18:20</b> - The soul who sins shall die.  The son shall not suffer for the iniquity of the father, nor the father suffer for the iniquity of the son.  The righteousness of the righteous shall be upon himself, and the wickedness of the wicked shall be upon himself.  (ESV)
</p>

<p>
<b>Romans 8:13</b> - For if you live according to the flesh you will die, but if by the Spirit you put to death the deeds of the body, you will live.
</p>

<p>
Examples of receiving forgiveness from Jesus.
</p>

<p>
<b>Matthew 9:2</b> - And behold, some people brought to him a paralytic, lying on a bed. And when Jesus saw their faith, he said to the paralytic, Take heart, my son; your sins are forgiven.

<p>
Forgiven after Jesus saw their faith.

<p>
Acts of faith.

</p>

<p>
Turning.
</p>

<p>
<b>Mark 4:11-12</b> - And he said to them, To you has been given the secret of the kingdom of God, but for those outside everything is in parables, so that they may indeed see but not perceive, and may indeed hear but not understand, lest they should <b>turn</b> and be forgiven.

<b>Matthew 19:4-9</b> - He answered, Have you not read that he who created them from the beginning made them male and female, and said, Therefore a man shall leave his father and his mother and hold fast to his wife, and they shall become one flesh? So they are no longer two but one flesh. What therefore God has joined together, let not man separate. They said to him, Why then did Moses command one to give a certificate of divorce and to send her away? He said to them, Because of your hardness of heart Moses allowed you to divorce your wives, but from the beginning it was not so. And I say to you: whoever divorces his wife, except for sexual immorality, and marries another, commits adultery. (ESV)
</p>

<p>
<b>Matthew 5:14-20</b> - You are the light of the world. A city set on a hill cannot be hidden. Nor do people light a lamp and put it under a basket, but on a stand, and it gives light to all in the house. In the same way, let your light shine before others, so that they may see your good works and give glory to your Father who is in heaven. Do not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them. For truly, I say to you, until heaven and earth pass away, not an iota, not a dot, will pass from the Law until all is accomplished. Therefore whoever relaxes one of the least of these commandments and teaches others to do the same will be called least in the kingdom of heaven, but whoever does them and teaches them will be called great in the kingdom of heaven. For I tell you, unless your righteousness exceeds that of the scribes and Pharisees, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven. (ESV)

<b>Leviticus 18:22</b> - You shall not lie with a male as with a woman; it is an abomination. (ESV)

</p>

<p>
I think faith is like casting a net to receive something.
</p>

<p>
If you want to catch something big then you need a lot of faith.
</p>

<p>
Faith receives salvation, and salvation is the gift which is received through faith.
Faith is something which a person must have to receive the free gift.
The onus is on us to receive the free gift.
</p>

<p>
We must approach Jesus.
We must repent (change our minds, turning from our wicked ways, and turn to God) and obey God.
God has said many things, about his statutes and about how we should listen to Jesus.
I think repentance (from the heart turning from sin) is still approaching Jesus because Jesus fulfilled the law.
</p>

<p>
Humble yourself and obey God's commandments (not out of pride, but out of authentic faith with God, being accountable to God, in secret).
</p>

<p>
For example, abstaining from partaking in stealing, or adultery and being faithful to God, even if you lose friends over it.
This type of obeying God's commandments is nothing to do with pride or self-exultation or self-righteousness and everything to do with being faithful to God and humbling oneself to God.
</p>

<p>
Trying to turn from sin in truth and reality.
</p>

<p>
<b>2 Chronicles 7:14</b> -  if my people who are called by my name humble themselves, and pray and seek my face and turn from their wicked ways, then I will hear from heaven and will forgive their sin and heal their land.  (ESV)

<b>Matthew 18:3</b> -  and said, Truly, I say to you, unless you turn and become like children, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven.  (ESV)

</p>

<p>
It says unless <b>your</b> righteousness.
</p>

<p>
Faith in Jesus probably qualifies a person to 'enter' the Kingdom of Heaven.
Also, following the law by faith in truth I think qualifies a person to enter the Kingdom of Heaven.
Also the Kingdom of Heaven, I think is from Heaven to Earth.

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>love, faith, service and patient endurance are all considered works</li>
</ul>

<p>
<b>Revelation of John 2:19</b> - I know your works, your love and faith and service and patient endurance, and that your latter works exceed the first.
</p>

<p>
Abraham's obedience is a work of faith.
</p>

<p>
<b>Hebrews 11:8</b> - By faith Abraham obeyed when he was called to go out to a place that he was to receive as an inheritance. And he went out, not knowing where he was going. (ESV)
</p>

<p>
<b>Hebrews 11:6</b> - And without faith it is impossible to please him, for whoever would draw near to God <b>must believe that he exists and that he rewards those who seek him.</b> (ESV)
</p>

<p>
Work substantiates faith because it is the act of receiving from God.
</p>

<p>
A work of faith could indeed be following the law in faith (as opposed to following the law by works).
</p>

<p>
For example, keeping your integrity, remaining faithful to God and not lying to God.
</p>

<p>
Patient endurance is a 'work of faith'.
</p>

<p>
<b>Revelation of John 3:8</b> - I know your <b>works</b>. Behold, I have set before you an open door, which no one is able to shut. I know that you have but little power, and yet you have <b>kept my word and have not denied my name</b>.  Behold, I will make those of the synagogue of Satan who say that they are Jews and are not, but lie—behold, I will make them come and bow down before your feet and they will learn that I have loved you.  Because you have kept my word about <b>patient endurance</b>, I will keep you from the hour of trial that is coming on the whole world, to try those who dwell on the earth.

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-5-5-3">
<p>
<b>James 2:22-26</b> - You see that faith was active along with his works, and faith was completed by his works; and the Scripture was fulfilled that says, Abraham believed God, and it was counted to him as righteousness—and he was called a friend of God. You see that a person is justified by works and not by faith alone. And in the same way was not also Rahab the prostitute justified by works when she received the messengers and sent them out by another way? For as the body apart from the spirit is dead, so also faith apart from works is dead. (ESV)
</p>

<p>
This is not a work of the law, but it is a work of faith: "<i>when she received the messengers and sent them out by another way</i>"
</p>

<p>
<b>James 2:26</b> - For as the body apart from the spirit is dead, so also faith apart from works is dead.
</p>

<p>
<b>Romans 3:28-31</b> - For we hold that one is justified by faith apart from works of the law. Or is God the God of Jews only? Is he not the God of Gentiles also? Yes, of Gentiles also, since God is one. He will justify the circumcised by faith and the uncircumcised through faith. Do we then overthrow the law by this faith? By no means! On the contrary, we uphold the law. (ESV)
</p>

<p>
The law is not overthrown but it is upheld.

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-5-5-5">
<p>
Her love is a work of faith.
</p>

<p>
<b>Luke 7:47-50</b> -  Therefore I tell you, her sins, which are many, are forgiven—for she loved much.  But he who is forgiven little, loves little.  And he said to her, Your sins are forgiven.  Then those who were at table with him began to say among themselves, Who is this, who even forgives sins?  And he said to the woman, Your faith has saved you; go in peace.  (ESV)
</p>

<p>
I also currently believe that one's response to forgiveness must be like the woman Jesus mentions in Luke 7:47 - with a PROPROTIONAL love for Jesus.

Whoever believes in him is not condemned, but whoever does not believe is condemned already, because he has not believed in the name of the only Son of God.  And this is the judgment: the light has come into the world, and people loved the darkness rather than the light because their deeds were evil.

<p>
<b>John 20:31</b> - but these are written so that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that by believing you may have life in his name.􀀁(ESV)
</p>

<p>
This is honestly just the starting point.
</p>

<p>
Continuing to believe that Jesus is the Messiah and the Only-begotten Son of God is enough to get saved, but it's not enough to be counted a disciple of Jesus.
</p>

<p>
And it's 'saved' but 'being saved' at the same time.
</p>

<p>
One wants to progress to having Jesus abide inside them.
</p>

<p>
I think that rejects His commandments but claiming to believe in Jesus Christ as the Son of God is an extremely precarious, and tentative position to be in,
and may indicate that the person doesn't <b>really</b> believe.
</p>

<p>
And if a person doesn't believe in reality, then that person probably isn't saved - so they are only lying to themself that they are saved.

When the young man heard this he went away sorrowful, for he had great possessions.  And Jesus said to his disciples, Truly, I say to you, only with difficulty will a rich person enter the kingdom of heaven.  Again I tell you, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich person to enter the kingdom of God.  When the disciples heard this, they were greatly astonished, saying, Who then can be saved?  But Jesus looked at them and said, With man this is impossible, but with God all things are possible.  Then Peter said in reply, See, we have left everything and followed you. What then will we have?  Jesus said to them, Truly, I say to you, in the new world, when the Son of Man will sit on his glorious throne, you who have followed me will also sit on twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.  And everyone who has left houses or brothers or sisters or father or mother or children or lands, for my name's sake, will receive a hundredfold and will inherit eternal life.

<b>John 15</b> - I am the true vine, and my Father is the vinedresser.  Every branch of mine that does not bear fruit he takes away, and every branch that does bear fruit he prunes, that it may bear more fruit.  Already you are clean because of the word that I have spoken to you.  Abide in me, and I in you. As the branch cannot bear fruit by itself, unless it abides in the vine, neither can you, unless you abide in me.  I am the vine; you are the branches. Whoever abides in me and I in him, he it is that bears much fruit, for apart from me you can do nothing.  If anyone does not abide in me he is thrown away like a branch and withers; and the branches are gathered, thrown into the fire, and burned.  If you abide in me, and my words abide in you, ask whatever you wish, and it will be done for you.  By this my Father is glorified, that you bear much fruit and so prove to be my disciples.  As the Father has loved me, so have I loved you. Abide in my love.  If you keep my commandments, you will abide in my love, just as I have kept my Father's commandments and abide in his love.  These things I have spoken to you, that my joy may be in you, and that your joy may be full.  This is my commandment, that you love one another as I have loved you.  Greater love has no one than this, that someone lays down his life for his friends.  You are my friends if you do what I command you.  No longer do I call you servants, for the servant does not know what his master is doing; but I have called you friends, for all that I have heard from my Father I have made known to you.  You did not choose me, but I chose you and appointed you that you should go and bear fruit and that your fruit should abide, so that whatever you ask the Father in my name, he may give it to you.  These things I command you, so that you will love one another.  If the world hates you, know that it has hated me before it hated you.  If you were of the world, the world would love you as its own; but because you are not of the world, but I chose you out of the world, therefore the world hates you.  Remember the word that I said to you: A servant is not greater than his master. If they persecuted me, they will also persecute you. If they kept my word, they will also keep yours.  But all these things they will do to you on account of my name, because they do not know him who sent me.  If I had not come and spoken to them, they would not have been guilty of sin, but now they have no excuse for their sin.  Whoever hates me hates my Father also.  If I had not done among them the works that no one else did, they would not be guilty of sin, but now they have seen and hated both me and my Father.  But the word that is written in their Law must be fulfilled: They hated me without a cause.  But when the Helper comes, whom I will send to you from the Father, the Spirit of truth, who proceeds from the Father, he will bear witness about me.  And you also will bear witness, because you have been with me from the beginning.

<p>
<b>Romans 11</b> - I ask, then, has God rejected his people? By no means! For I myself am an Israelite, a descendant of Abraham, a member of the tribe of Benjamin. God has not rejected his people whom he foreknew. Do you not know what the Scripture says of Elijah, how he appeals to God against Israel? Lord, they have killed your prophets, they have demolished your altars, and I alone am left, and they seek my life. But what is God's reply to him? I have kept for myself seven thousand men who have not bowed the knee to Baal. So too at the present time there is a remnant, chosen by grace. But if it is by grace, it is no longer on the basis of works; otherwise grace would no longer be grace. What then? Israel failed to obtain what it was seeking. The elect obtained it, but the rest were hardened, as it is written, God gave them a spirit of stupor, eyes that would not see and ears that would not hear, down to this very day. And David says, Let their table become a snare and a trap, a stumbling block and a retribution for them; let their eyes be darkened so that they cannot see, and bend their backs forever. So I ask, did they stumble in order that they might fall? By no means! Rather through their trespass salvation has come to the Gentiles, so as to make Israel jealous. Now if their trespass means riches for the world, and if their failure means riches for the Gentiles, how much more will their full inclusion mean! Now I am speaking to you Gentiles. Inasmuch then as I am an apostle to the Gentiles, I magnify my ministry in order somehow to make my fellow Jews jealous, and thus save some of them. For if their rejection means the reconciliation of the world, what will their acceptance mean but life from the dead? If the dough offered as firstfruits is holy, so is the whole lump, and if the root is holy, so are the branches. But if some of the branches were broken off, and you, although a wild olive shoot, were grafted in among the others and now share in the nourishing root of the olive tree, do not be arrogant toward the branches. If you are, remember it is not you who support the root, but the root that supports you. Then you will say, Branches were broken off so that I might be grafted in. That is true. They were broken off because of their unbelief, but you stand fast through faith. So do not become proud, but stand in awe. For if God did not spare the natural branches, neither will he spare you. Note then the kindness and the severity of God: severity toward those who have fallen, but God's kindness to you, provided you continue in his kindness. Otherwise you too will be cut off. And even they, if they do not continue in their unbelief, will be grafted in, for God has the power to graft them in again. For if you were cut from what is by nature a wild olive tree, and grafted, contrary to nature, into a cultivated olive tree, how much more will these, the natural branches, be grafted back into their own olive tree. Lest you be wise in your own conceits, I want you to understand this mystery, brothers: a partial hardening has come upon Israel, until the fullness of the Gentiles has come in. And in this way all Israel will be saved, as it is written, The Deliverer will come from Zion, he will banish ungodliness from Jacob; and this will be my covenant with them when I take away their sins. As regards the gospel, they are enemies of God for your sake. But as regards election, they are beloved for the sake of their forefathers. For the gifts and the calling of God are irrevocable. Just as you were at one time disobedient to God but now have received mercy because of their disobedience, so they too have now been disobedient in order that by the mercy shown to you they also may now receive mercy. For God has consigned all to disobedience, that he may have mercy on all. Oh, the depth of the riches and wisdom and knowledge of God! How unsearchable are his judgments and how inscrutable his ways! For who has known the mind of the Lord, or who has been his counselor? Or who has given a gift to him that he might be repaid? For from him and through him and to him are all things. To him be glory forever. Amen. (ESV)

<b>Matthew 12:33-37</b> -  Either make the tree good and its fruit good, or make the tree bad and its fruit bad, for the tree is known by its fruit.  You brood of vipers! How can you speak good, when you are evil?  For out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks.  The good person out of his good treasure brings forth good, and the evil person out of his evil treasure brings forth evil.  I tell you, on the day of judgment people will give account for every careless word they speak, for by your words you will be justified, and by your words you will be condemned.  (ESV)

Whoever practices righteousness is righteous, as he is righteous.  Whoever makes a practice of sinning is of the devil, for the devil has been sinning from the beginning. The reason the Son of God appeared was to destroy the works of the devil.  No one born of God makes a practice of sinning, for God's seed abides in him, and he cannot keep on sinning because he has been born of God.  By this it is evident who are the children of God, and who are the children of the devil: whoever does not practice righteousness is not of God, nor is the one who does not love his brother.

They are gossips, slanderers, haters of God, insolent, haughty, boastful, inventors of evil, disobedient to parents, foolish, faithless, heartless, ruthless.  Though they know God's decree that those who practice such things deserve to die, they not only do them but give approval to those who practice them.  (ESV)

Consider him who endured from sinners such hostility against himself, so that you may not grow weary or fainthearted.  In your struggle against sin you have <span class="underline">not yet resisted to the point of shedding your blood</span>.  And have you forgotten the exhortation that addresses you as sons? My son, do not regard lightly the discipline of the Lord, nor be weary when reproved by him.  For the Lord disciplines the one he loves, and chastises every son whom he receives.  It is for discipline that you have to endure. God is treating you as sons. For what son is there whom his father does not discipline?  <b>If you are left without discipline, in which all have participated, then you are illegitimate children and not sons</b>.  Besides this, we have had earthly fathers who disciplined us and we respected them. Shall we not much more be subject to the Father of spirits and live?  For they disciplined us for a short time as it seemed best to them, but he disciplines us for our good, that we may <b>share his holiness</b>.  For the moment all discipline seems painful rather than pleasant, but later it yields the peaceful <b>fruit of righteousness</b> to those who have been trained by it.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-6-12">
<p>
I personally do not endorse gay marriage. When I have in the past, I repent of that. That is not to say it is not possible to endorse it yourself but a person is accountable to God for that act of annulling one of His commandments.

I believe that God's grace extends to all who put their faith in Jesus and have Jesus' righteousness imputed onto them, the righteousness of faith in Jesus Christ God's Son who has paid through his blood the price for our sin.
</p>

<p>
I believe one must know that God's law is right and when presented with God's law, they recognise that the law is right and recognise their transgression.
</p>

<p>
And no-one should endorse sinful things. Homosexuality is erroneous.
If they do, however, endorse it then I think that inhibits them from approaching God.

If a newly born-again Christian is spending all their time with sinners though and endorsing continually instead of being discipled, then they can

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-7-3-1">
<p>
When a person is born-again of the Spirit, they receive the Spirit which helps them to stop sinning. It's really important to stop sinning.
</p>

<p>
<b>1 John 5:18</b> -  We know that everyone who has been born of God does not keep on sinning, but he who was born of God protects him, and the evil one does not touch him.  (ESV)
</p>

<p>
<b>Ezekiel 11:19-20</b> - And I will give them one heart, and a new spirit I will put within them.

And they shall be my people, and I will be their God. (ESV)
</p>

<p>
<b>I John 3:9</b> - No one born of God makes a practice of sinning, for God's seed abides in him, and he cannot keep on sinning because he has been born of God.
</p>

<p>
But I would much like my dream life to be like the following:
</p>

<p>
<b>John 5:19</b> - So Jesus said to them, Truly, truly, I say to you, the Son can do nothing of his own accord, but only what he sees the Father doing. For whatever the Father does, that the Son does likewise.
</p>

<p>
Whoever loves in the way Jesus loved us and the way Jesus commanded us has been born of God and knows God.
</p>

<p>
<b>I John 4:7</b> - Beloved, let us love one another, for love is from God, and whoever loves has been born of God and knows God.
</p>

<p>
Anyone who <b>truly believes</b>.
</p>

<p>
<b>I John 5:1</b> - Everyone who believes that Jesus is the Christ has been born of God, and everyone who loves the Father loves whoever has been born of him.
</p>

<p>
<b>I John 5:4</b> - For everyone who has been born of God overcomes the world. And this is the victory that has overcome the world—our faith.
</p>

<p>
<b>I John 5:18</b> - We know that everyone who has been born of God does not keep on sinning, but he who was born of God protects him, and the evil one does not touch him.
</p>

<p>
I feel like stopping sin is very important after being born again.
</p>

<p>
<b>John 5:14</b> - Afterward Jesus found him in the temple and said to him, See, you are well! Sin no more, that nothing worse may happen to you.

<h3 id="orgd7a2809"><span class="section-number-3">7.4.</span> Justification by faith for the both adherents of the law and the gentiles</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-7-4">
<p>
Justification by faith is the correct teaching but the promise is for the gentiles AND the adherent of the law but they all must have faith, and pursuing the law as if by works is the problem, but pursuing the law by faith is ok.
</p>

<p>
<b>Romans 7:22</b> - For I delight in the law of God, in my inner being, (ESV)
</p>

<p>
<b>Romans 9:30-32</b> - What shall we say, then? That Gentiles who did not pursue righteousness have attained it, that is, a righteousness that is by faith; but that Israel who pursued a law that would lead to righteousness did not succeed in reaching that law. Why? Because they did not pursue it by faith, but as if it were based on works. They have stumbled over the stumbling stone, (ESV)
</p>

<p>
<b>Romans 4:15-16</b> - For the law brings wrath, but where there is no law there is no transgression. That is why it depends on faith, in order that the promise may rest on grace and be guaranteed to all his offspring—not only to the adherent of the law but also to the one who shares the faith of Abraham, who is the father of us all, (ESV)

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-7-6">
<p>
Predestined, called, justified, glorified - sounds like election.
</p>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-org32577fe" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="org32577fe"><span class="section-number-4">7.6.1.</span> God is the one who justifies</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-7-6-1">
<p>
Romans 8:33: Who shall bring any charge against God's elect? It is God who justifies.
</p>

<p>
<b>Romans 8:30</b> - And those whom he predestined he also called, and those whom he called he also justified, and those whom he justified he also glorified. (ESV)
</p>

<p>
But repentance is a work of the heart which is an act of faith.
I believe repentance is inseparable from faith because intrinsic to faith is belief and intrinsic to belief is metanoia (changing one's mind).
</p>

<p>
At it's most basic form repentance means a person believes in Jesus as the Son of God and the Messiah who, being innocent, paid the price for their sin through His broken body and shed blood on the cross - a perfect and eternal offering; that He died there but God resurrected Him, and He is Lord of Heaven and Earth.
</p>

<p>
But I believe we are forgiven to forgive others. That must be part of the act of faith and the change of heart, I think.
</p>

<p>
<b>Matthew 6:15</b> - but if you do not forgive others their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses.  (ESV)
</p>

<h4 id="org0498cd2"><span class="section-number-4">7.6.2.</span> Justified by faith alone. But faith is substantiated by works</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-7-6-2">
<p>
<b>James 2:10</b> - For whoever keeps the whole law but fails in one point has become accountable for all of it.  For he who said, Do not commit adultery, also said, Do not murder. If you do not commit adultery but do murder, you have become a transgressor of the law.  So speak and so act as those who are to be judged under the law of liberty.  For judgment is without mercy to one who has shown no mercy. Mercy triumphs over judgment.  What good is it, my brothers, if someone says he has faith but does not have works? Can that faith save him?  If a brother or sister is poorly clothed and lacking in daily food, and one of you says to them, Go in peace, be warmed and filled, without giving them the things needed for the body, what good is that?  So also faith by itself, if it does not have works, is dead.  But someone will say, You have faith and I have works. Show me your faith apart from your works, and I will show you my faith by my works.  You believe that God is one; you do well. Even the demons believe—and shudder!  Do you want to be shown, you foolish person, that faith apart from works is useless?  Was not Abraham our father justified by works when he offered up his son Isaac on the altar?  You see that faith was active along with his works, and faith was completed by his works; and the Scripture was fulfilled that says, Abraham believed God, and it was counted to him as righteousness—and he was called a friend of God.  You see that a person is justified by works and not by faith alone.
</p>

<p>
I tend to agree with James on this.
Eliminating works from faith is not good.
</p>

<p>
Works:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>obedience</li>
<li>faithfulness
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>keeping God's commandments</li>
</ul></li>
<li>trust</li>
<li>fear of God</li>
<li>response of love
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>thankfulness</li>
<li>praise</li>
<li>forgiving others</li>
</ul></li>
<li>humility
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>keeping God's commandments</li>
</ul></li>
<li>patient endurance (time)</li>
</ul>

<p>
If a person believes that Jesus Christ is the Son of the Living God then they abide in Christ.
But do they <b>really</b> believe? Because if they don't <b>really</b> believe it deep down then but are lying to themself they may not abide in Christ at all.
How can a person believe without having a relationship with God? A relationship involves more than belief.
</p>

<p>
If a person does not have obedience, trust and
repentance from sin, but their faith has belief, then they only
abide in Jesus extremely precariously, and also that person's 'faith' probably wont receive much at all from God.
</p>

<p>
Faith = Belief * truth * obedience * faithfulness * fear-of-God * response-of-love * patient-endurance(time)
</p>

<p>
These things are factors of faith.
God is the judge.
</p>

<p>
A person must/should <b>do</b> what Jesus said.
</p>

<p>
<b>Luke 6:47-49</b> - Everyone who comes to me and hears my words and does them, I will show you what he is like: he is like a man building a house, who dug deep and laid the foundation on the rock. And when a flood arose, the stream broke against that house and could not shake it, because it had been well built.  But the one who hears and does not do them is like a man who built a house on the ground without a foundation. When the stream broke against it, immediately it fell, and the ruin of that house was great.
</p>

<p>
<b>Matthew 7:24-27</b> - Everyone then who hears these words of mine and does them will be like a wise man who built his house on the rock. And the rain fell, and the floods came, and the winds blew and beat on that house, but it did not fall, because it had been founded on the rock. And everyone who hears these words of mine and does not do them will be like a foolish man who built his house on the sand. And the rain fell, and the floods came, and the winds blew and beat against that house, and it fell, and great was the fall of it. (ESV)

But this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days, declares the LORD: I will put my law within them, and I will write it on their hearts.

<p>
Glorification is the good works including forgiving others, relieving others' burdens, etc.
</p>

<p>
Imitating Jesus, forgiving others, walking righteously, and doing good works (bearing one-another's burdens) glorifies Jesus and glorifies God.
</p>

<p>
This should never replace Jesus.
</p>

<p>
If someone's lord is money and not Jesus and then they try to do good works such as setting up businesses, I feel like this glorifies money, not Jesus.

<p>
Here, Zacchaeus, renounces money and makes Jesus his Lord. This must happen first.

<b>Luke 19:8</b> - And Zacchaeus stood and said to the Lord, Behold, Lord, the half of my goods I give to the poor.  And if I have defrauded anyone of anything, I restore it fourfold.  (ESV)

Abrah did this too. It's a necessary act of faith.

<p>
<b>Genesis 14:20-24</b> - and blessed be God Most High, who has delivered your enemies into your hand! And Abram gave him a tenth of everything. And the king of Sodom said to Abram, Give me the persons, but take the goods for yourself. But Abram said to the king of Sodom, I have lifted my hand to the Lord, God Most High, Possessor of heaven and earth, that I would not take a thread or a sandal strap or anything that is yours, lest you should say, I have made Abram rich. I will take nothing but what the young men have eaten, and the share of the men who went with me. Let Aner, Eshcol, and Mamre take their share.

For example, to truly obey God and love / do no harm to one's neighbour involves relieving other's burdens as they ask more from you.

Jesus endured the weight of His cross to lighten our burden.

<b>Hebrews 12:3</b> - Consider him who endured from sinners such hostility against himself, so that you may not grow weary or fainthearted.

We are called to do the same, lightening the burdens of others.
We are forgiven and given grace, then we can choose to forgive others and lighten their burdens - grace propagates.

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-7-9-2">
<p>
<b>Proverbs 19:11</b> - Good sense makes one slow to anger, and it is his glory to overlook an offense. (ESV)
</p>

<p>
<b>Ephesians 4:32</b> - Be kind to one another, tenderhearted, forgiving one another, as God in Christ forgave you. (ESV)
</p>

<p>
You are required to:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>forgive others for your sake</li>
<li>forgive others for their sake</li>
<li>forgive others as a response of love to Jesus for your sins being forgiven</li>
<li>to be able to forgive others is a gift to you and part of glorification</li>
</ul>

<p>
This is simultaneously required and is part of glorification/holiness.
</p>

<p>
I think there's something very important about forgiving others especially for things which happen after being born-again of the Spirit and receiving the Holy Spirit.
</p>

<p>
<b>Colossians 3:13</b> - bearing with one another and, if one has a complaint against another, forgiving each other; as the Lord has forgiven you, so you also must forgive.
</p>

<p>
<b>John 20:21-23</b> - Jesus said to them again, Peace be with you. As the Father has sent me, even so I am sending you. And when he had said this, he breathed on them and said to them, Receive the Holy Spirit. If you forgive the sins of anyone, they are forgiven; if you withhold forgiveness from anyone, it is withheld.
</p>

<p>
Especially immediately after receiving the Holy Spirit, Jesus forgives those who you forgive - this is partaking in the process of forgiveness.
</p>

<p>
Jesus is the one who forgives sin, but we actually participate in propagating that forgiveness.
</p>

<p>
<i><b>Forgiving others entirely is also required</b></i>
</p>

<p>
Jesus can forgive others even if you do not, but Father God cannot forgive you unless you forgive.
</p>

<p>
<b>Matthew 6:12</b> - and forgive us our debts, as we also have forgiven our debtors.
</p>

<p>
<b>Matthew 6:14-15</b> - For if you forgive others their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you,
</p>

<p>
<b>Matthew 18:35</b> - So also my heavenly Father will do to every one of you, if you do not forgive your brother from your heart.

<b>Luke 6:35-36</b> -  But love your enemies, and do good, and lend, expecting nothing in return, and your reward will be great, and you will be sons of the Most High, for he is kind to the ungrateful and the evil.  Be merciful, even as your Father is merciful.  (ESV)

<p>
<b>Mark 12:41-44</b> -  And he sat down opposite the treasury and watched the people putting money into the offering box.  Many rich people put in large sums.  And a poor widow came and put in two small copper coins, which make a penny.  And he called his disciples to him and said to them, Truly, I say to you, this poor widow has put in more than all those who are contributing to the offering box.  For they all contributed out of their abundance, but s he out of her poverty has put in everything she had, all she had to live on.  (ESV)
