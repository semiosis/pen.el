information extraction
    https://web.stanford.edu/~jurafsky/slp3/17.pdf

    Extracting limited kinds of semantic
    content from text.

    Turns the unstructured information
    extraction information embedded in texts
    into structured data, for example for
    populating a relational database to enable
    further processing.

    Steps
    -   Find the proper names or named
        entities in a text.
    -   The task of named entity recognition
        (NER) is to find each named entity
        recognition mention of a named entity
        in the text and label its type.

terminology extraction
automatic keyphrase extraction
keyphrase extraction
    http://bdewilde.github.io/blog/2014/09/23/intro-to-automatic-keyphrase-extraction/

    Extraction of important topical words and
    phrases from documents.

    Suffers from poor performance relative to
    many other core NLP tasks, partly because
    there’s no objectively “correct” set of
    keyphrases for a given document.

    Two steps
    -   A set of words and phrases that could
        convey the topical content of a
        document are identified, then
    -   these candidates are scored/ranked and
        the “best” are selected as a
        document’s keyphrases.

entity extraction
    [#information extraction]
    [task]

    Identify/locate and classify the names of
    people, organisations, locations and other
    entities within text.

    Locate and classify named entity mentions
    in unstructured text into pre-defined
    categories.

    Example:
    - Categorise all the named entities in
      this unstructured text. Organise them
      under the categories:
      - organisation
      - person

    A subtask of information extraction that
    seeks to locate and classify named
    entities mentioned in unstructured text
    into pre-defined categories such as person
    names, organizations, locations, medical
    codes, time expressions, quantities,
    monetary values, percentages, etc.

    Involves extracting key information,
    called entities, from blocks of text.

    These entities are words or series of
    words that are classified into categories
    (i.e. person, location, company, food).

    Hence, the two main parts of NER are
    entity detection and entity
    categorization.

    Detect and label named entities.

    Helps you easily identify the key elements
    in a text, like names of people, places,
    brands, monetary values, and more.
    
    Extracting the main entities in a text
    helps sort unstructured data and detect
    important information, which is crucial if
    you have to deal with large datasets.

bag-of-words
bag-of-words model
BoW
BoW model
    https://ryanong.co.uk/2020/01/03/day-3-word-embeddings/

    A simplifying representation used in NLP
    and IR.
    
    In this model, a text (such as a sentence
    or a document) is represented as the bag
    (multiset) of its words, disregarding
    grammar and even word order but keeping
    multiplicity.

Byte Pair Encoding
BPE
    [subword algorithm]

    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byte_pair_encoding

    Byte pair encoding or digram coding is a
    simple form of data compression in which
    the most common pair of consecutive bytes
    of data is replaced with a byte that does
    not occur within that data.
    
    A table of the replacements is required to
    rebuild the original data.

    A simple data compression algorithm first
    introduced in 1994 supercharging almost
    all advanced NLP models of today
    (including BERT).

Schemata
    Cognitive structures representing generic
    knowledge, i.e. structures which do not
    contain information about particular
    entities, instances or events, but rather
    about their general form.

ontology
    An ontology encompasses a representation,
    formal naming and definition of the
    categories, properties and relations
    between the concepts, data and entities
    that substantiate one, many or all domains
    of discourse.

semantic repository
    An engine similar to a database management
    systems (DBMS) that permits the storage,
    querying and handling of structured data.
    
    In addition, a semantic repository uses
    ontologies as semantic schemata to
    automatically reason about the queried
    data.
    
    Semantic repositories make use of generic
    and flexible physical data models, such as
    graphs.
    
    This permits them to quickly read and
    implement new metadata schemata or
    ontologies.
    
    As a result, semantic repositories provide
    better incorporation of assorted data as
    well as more analytical power.
    
    However, these kinds of repositories are
    still in the early stages of their
    development.

Natural language processing
NLP
Computational linguistics
    One of the most important technologies of
    the information age.
    
    Applications of NLP are everywhere because
    people communicate almost everything in
    language:
    - web search,
    - advertising,
    - emails,
    - customer service,
    - language translation,
    - virtual agents,
    - medical reports, etc.
    
    DL and NN approaches have obtained very
    high performance across many different NLP
    tasks, using single end-to-end neural
    models that do not require traditional,
    task-specific feature engineering.

    An interdisciplinary field concerned with
    the statistical or rule-based modeling of
    NL from a computational perspective, as
    well as the study of appropriate
    computational approaches to linguistic
    questions.
    
Minimum Edit Distance
    ewwlinks +/"Minimum edit distance for finding string distance" "http://www.exploredatabase.com/2020/03/minimum-edit-distance-for-finding-distance-between-strings.html"

    2 types:
    - basic minimum edit distance
    - Levenshtein distance

basic minimum edit distance
    [minimum edit distance]

    The cost for each operation is 1. That is,
    insertion cost = deletion cost =
    substitution cost = 1

Levenshtein distance
    [minimum edit distance]

    The cost for insertion and deletion will
    be 1 2 for substitution (substitution is
    considered as a combination of delete and
    insert) 

Stylometry
Stylometics
    The application of the study of linguistic
    style, usually to written language, but it
    has successfully been applied to music and
    to fine-art paintings as well.

    Examples:
    - prevalence of adjectives,
    - subordinate clauses, and
    - compound sentences

Word2Vec
    A group of models that tries to represent
    each word in a large text as a vector in a
    space of N dimensions (which we will call
    features) making similar words also be
    close to each other.

    One of the most popular framework for
    mapping word representation to a vector
    space using a large corpus of text.

Skip-Gram
Word2Vec Skip-Gram
    [#word2vec]
    [model]
    [architecture]

    One of the models in the Word2Vec group of
    models.

    Takes a word as input and predicts its
    context.

    Intuition
        Skip-gram takes every word in a large
        corpora (we will call it the focus
        word) and also takes one-by-one the
        words that surround it within a
        defined ‘window’ to then feed a NN
        that after training will predict the
        probability for each word to actually
        appear in the window around the focus
        word.


    Model predict context from inner word.

    Model uses the current word to predict the
    surrounding window of context words.

    Key point:
        Weighs nearby context words more
        heavily than more distant context
        words.

Continuous Bag of Words
CBOW
    [architecture]

    Model predict inner word from context.

    Model predicts the current word from a
    window of surrounding context words.

    Key point:
        The order of context words does not
        influence prediction (bag-of-words
        assumption).

CBOW vs skip-gram
    CBOW is faster while skip-gram is slower
    but does a better job for infrequent
    words.

Natural-language understanding

contextual similarity vs semantic similarity
    https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/01690969108406936#:~:text=Semantic%20similarity%20is%20estimated%20by,and%20the%20discriminability%20of%20contexts.

contextual similarity
    If the representation has more contextual
    similarity that means it is a more
    expressive representation.

    Examples:
    - word vectors
      They are similar in representation.
      This means you can do algebra with them.
    - emacs
      When everything is represented in a
      grid, this means you can compose and
      apply the same operations to many
      things that exist within the
      representation.

    ewwlinks +/"Contextual Similarity" "http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:https://medium.com/deeper-learning/glossary-of-deep-learning-word-embedding-f90c3cec34ca"

semantic similarity
    (of two words or word vectors)

    Methods:
    - Euclidean distance
    - Cosine similarity

    Sometimes, the nearest neighbors according
    to this metric reveal rare but relevant
    words that lie outside an average human's
    vocabulary.

GloVe
    (coined from Global Vectors)

    A model for distributed word
    representation.
    
    The model is an unsupervised learning
    algorithm for obtaining vector
    representations for words.
    
    This is achieved by mapping words into a
    meaningful space where the distance
    between words is related to semantic
    similarity

word embedding
    Types:
    - distributional word embeddings
    - contextualised word embeddings

    types:
    - Word2Vec (2013)
    - GloVe (2014)
    - FastText (2017)
    - ELMo (2018)

distributional word embeddings
fixed Word Embeddings
    https://ryanong.co.uk/2020/01/03/day-3-word-embeddings/

    Better than BoW.

    Each word has only one vector
    representation that’s formed during the
    training phase and this vector
    representation is used for the same word
    in different context.

    Three popular types:
    - Word2Vec (2013),
    - GloVe (2014), and
    - FastText (2017).

contextualised word embeddings
    Types:
    - ELMo
    - ...

    Better than:
    - distributional word embeddings.

    Distributional word embeddings means that
    each word has only one vector
    representation that’s formed during the
    training phase and this vector
    representation is used for the same word
    in different context.
    
    However, as we know, the same word in
    different contexts has different meanings.
    
    Therefore, it makes more sense for the
    vector representation of the same word to
    be different depending on the context of
    which it appears in.
    
    To address this, contextualised word
    embeddings such as ELMo (2018) was
    introduced, whereby word embeddings of the
    same word can change depending on the
    context it appears in.

popular NLP / IR algorithms
    Examples:
    - Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA/LSI/SVD)
    - Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)
    - Random Projections (RP)
    - Hierarchical Dirichlet Process (HDP)
    - word2vec deep learning

pooling strategy

spaCy
    While it’s possible to solve some problems
    starting from only the raw characters,
    it’s usually better to use linguistic
    knowledge to add useful information.
    That’s exactly what spaCy is designed to
    do:
        you put in raw text, and get back a
        Doc object, that comes with a variety
        of annotations.

    After tokenization, spaCy can parse and
    tag a given Doc.

Spatial Role Labeling
    https://www.cs.tulane.edu/~pkordjam/SpRL.htm

    Side note:
        Combined problog with spacy
        $MYGIT/mmxgn/sprl-spacy/README.md

    One of the essential functions of natural
    language is to talk about spatial
    relationships between objects.

    Linguistic constructs can express highly
    complex, relational structures of objects,
    spatial relations between them, and
    patterns of motion through space relative
    to some reference point.

    Understanding such spatial utterances is a
    problem in many areas, including robotics,
    navigation, traffic management, and query
    answering systems.

    Learning how to map this information onto
    a formal representation from text is a
    challenging problem.

    The task of spatial role labeling
    introduces an annotation scheme proposed
    that is language-independent and
    facilitates the application of machine
    learning techniques.

    The framework consists of a set of spatial
    roles based on the theory of holistic
    spatial semantics with the intent of
    covering all aspects of spatial concepts,
    including both static and dynamic spatial
    relations.

    Let us illustrate the spatial role
    labeling task with the following example:

    Example:
        For the sentence:

            Give me the gray book on the big table.

        Spatial role labeling results in the
        following output:

            Give me [the gray book]TRAJECTOR [on]SPATIAL_INDICATOR [the big table]LANDMARK.

    Labels:
    - trajector
    - spatial indicator
      (often a preposition) establishes the
      type of spatial relation
    - landmark

    The phrase headed by the token book is
    referring to a trajector object, the
    phrase headed by the token table is
    referring to the role of a landmark and
    these are related by the spatial
    expression on denoted as spatial
    indicator.

ELMo
Embeddings from Language Models

    https://medium.com/saarthi-ai/elmo-for-contextual-word-embedding-for-text-classification-24c9693b0045?fbclid=IwAR3HuuVeTw9jV8s0r_amQw33WH-wLKObHJzVgtA_9lP6EV1gnCkuKLH_66Q

    Uses bi-directional LSTM in training, so
    that its language model not only
    understands the next word, but also the
    previous word in the sentence.

    Contains
    - 2-layer bidirectional LSTM backbone
    - residual connection is added between the
      first and second layers.

    Salient features
    - ELMo word representations are purely
      character-based.

      This allows the network to use
      morphological clues to form robust
      representations for out-of-vocabulary
      tokens unseen during training.

    - Unlike other word embeddings, it
      generates word vectors on run time.

    - It gives embedding of anything you put
      in — characters, words, sentences,
      paragraphs, but it is built for sentence
      embeddings in mind.

    You can apply ELMo to almost any NLP
    pipeline, and it will work like a charm.

fine tuning on a specific text classification task
    BERT, LASER, FASTTEXT, ELMO

contextual model
    Word embeddings are generated based on the
    context of the word’s use in a sentence,
    and thus a single word can have multiple
    embeddings.
    
    For example, BERT would produce different
    embeddings for Mercury in the following
    two sentences:
    
    “Mercury is visible in the night sky” and
    “Mercury is often confused with Hermes,
    the fleet-footed messenger of Greek gods. ”

Factors Related with Sentiment Analysis
    - Polarity
    - Subjectivity
    - Intensity
    - Author

Polarity
    [#sentiment analysis]

    Defines the phase of emotions expressed in
    the analyzed sentence.
    
    It ranges from -1 to 1 and goes like:

    * Very Positive
    * Positive
    * Neutral
    * Negative
    * Very Negative

    On account of polarity the emotion and
    sentiment of the writer can be easily
    described.
    
    For example a person has written a review
    for some hotel as "Very bad service and
    staff".
    
    Suppose the polarity of this sentence
    would be -0.56.
    
    It is clear from the values that it is a
    negative emotion and against the brand
    image of Hotel.
    
    This way polarity could easily determine
    the end sentiment.

Subjectivity
    [#sentiment analysis]

    ewwlinks +/"Subjectivity" "https://www.presentslide.in/2019/08/sentiment-analysis-textblob-library.html"

    Polarity alone is not enough to deal with
    complex text sentences.
    
    Sometimes the sentence needs more
    attribute analysis to check weather it is
    describing features or opinions on some
    object.

Intensity
    [#sentiment analysis]

    Along with the polarity and subjectivity
    another important factor is intensity.
    
    It defines how strong or weak the emotion
    is with respect to the context.

Author
    [#sentiment analysis]

    The person who has the ownership for that

NLU
    Takes up the understanding of the data
    based on grammar, the context in which it
    was said and decide on intent and
    entities.

NLP
    Converts a text into structured data or,
    oppositely, automatically turning data
    into prose.

NLG
    Generates a text based on structured data.

    3 stages in the NLG process:
    
    1. Document planning:
       Deciding what is to be said and
       creating an abstract document that
       outlines the structure of the
       information to be presented.
    
    2. Microplanning:
       Generation of referring expressions,
       word choice, and aggregation to flesh
       out the document specifications.
    
    3. Realisation:
       Converting the abstract document
       specifications to a real text, using
       domain knowledge about syntax,
       morphology, etc.

non-destructive tokenization
    [principle]

    The tokens, sentences, etc., are simply
    indexes into a long array.
    
    In other words, they don’t carve the text
    stream into little pieces.
    
    So each sentence is a span with a start
    and an end index into the document array.

summarisation
    [#NLP]

    2 types:
    - abstractive
    - extractive

TextRank
    [summarization algorithm]
    - graph-based
    - extractive
    - unsupervised

    https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2018/11/introduction-text-summarization-textrank-python/

    Example:
        from gensim.summarization import summarize
        
    What the difference between TextRank and
    PageRank?

    The simple answer:
        PageRank is for webpage ranking, and
        TextRank is for text ranking.
    
    The webpage in PageRank is the text in
    TextRank, so the basic idea is the same.

Extractive Summarization
    Rely on extracting several parts, such as
    phrases and sentences, from a piece of
    text and stack them together to create a
    summary.
    
    Therefore, identifying the right sentences
    for summarization is of utmost importance
    in an extractive method.

    2 types of tasks:
    - generic summarization
    - query relevant summarization

generic summarization
    [task of extractive summarization]

    Focuses on obtaining a generic summary or
    abstract of the collection (whether
    documents, or sets of images, or videos,
    news stories etc.). 

query relevant summarization
query-based summarization
    [task of extractive summarization]

    Summarizes objects specific to a query.

Abstractive Summarization

    entirely new summary.
    
    Some parts of this summary may not even
    appear in the original text.

Sentence breaking

Grammatical analysis
grammatical parse
    The process of correlating the line
    sequence of lexemes (words) of the
    language with its formal grammar.
    
    The result of this is usually a parse tree
    or an abstract syntactical tree.
    
    For grammatical parsing of computer
    languages context-free grammars are used.

Parsing
    Determine the parse tree (grammatical
    analysis) of a given sentence.
    
    The grammar for NLs is ambiguous and
    typical sentences have multiple possible
    analyses.
    
    In fact, perhaps surprisingly, for a
    typical sentence there may be thousands of
    potential parses (most of which will seem
    completely nonsensical to a human).
    
    There are two primary types of parsing,
    Dependency Parsing and Constituency
    Parsing.
    
    Dependency Parsing focuses on the
    relationships between words in a sentence
    (marking things like Primary Objects and
    predicates), whereas Constituency Parsing
    focuses on building out the Parse Tree
    using a Probabilistic Context-Free Grammar
    (PCFG).
    
    See also: Stochastic grammar.

stochastic grammar
    A grammar framework with a probabilistic
    notion of grammaticality:

    - Stochastic context-free grammar
    - Statistical parsing
    - Data-oriented parsing
    - Hidden Markov model
    - Estimation theory

Morphological segmentation
    Separate words into individual morphemes
    and identify the class of the morphemes.
    
    The difficulty of this task depends
    greatly on the complexity of the
    morphology (i.e. the structure of words)
    of the language being considered.
    
    English has fairly simple morphology,
    especially inflectional morphology, and
    thus it is often possible to ignore this
    task entirely and simply model all
    possible forms of a word (e.g. "open,
    opens, opened, opening") as separate
    words.
    
    In languages such as Turkish or Meitei, a
    highly agglutinated Indian language,
    however, such an approach is not possible,
    as each dictionary entry has thousands of
    possible word forms.

morpheme
    The smallest meaningful unit in a
    language.
    
    A morpheme is not identical to a word.
    
    The main difference between them is that a
    morpheme sometimes does not stand alone,
    but a word, by definition, always stands
    alone.
    
    The linguistics field of study dedicated
    to morphemes is called morphology.

    What Makes BERT so Amazing?
    - BERT is a contextual model

      Word embeddings are generated based on
      the context of the word’s use in a
      sentence, and thus a single word can
      have multiple embeddings. For example,
      BERT would produce different embeddings
      for Mercury in the following two
      sentences: “Mercury is visible in the
      night sky” and “Mercury is often
      confused with Hermes, the fleet-footed
      messenger of Greek gods.”

    - BERT enables transfer learning
    
      This is referred to as “NLP’s ImageNet
      Moment.” Google has pre-trained BERT on
      Wikipedia, and this pre-trained model
      can now be used on other more specific
      datasets like a customer support bot for
      your company. And remember this
      pre-training is expensive, which you can
      now skip. So, your starting point is a
      smart model (trained on general human
      speech) not just an algorithm in need of
      training.

    - BERT can be fine-tuned cheaply and
      quickly on a small set of
      domain-specific data and will yield more
      accurate results than by training on
      these same domain-s

    Bidirectional
        BERT is naturally bidirectional.
    Generalizable
        Pre-trained BERT model can be
        fine-tuned easily for downstream NLP
        task.

        state-of-the- art results for many NLP
        tasks.
    Universal
        Trained on Wikipedia + BookCorpus. No
        special dataset needed.

    The GPT2, and some later models like
    TransformerXL and XLNet are auto-
    regressive in nature. BERT is not. That is
    a trade off. In losing auto-regression,
    BERT gained the ability to incorporate the
    context on both sides of a word to gain
    better results. XLNet brings back
    autoregression while finding an
    alternative way to incorporate the context
    on both sides.

Transformer
    Not only improved performance in sentence-

    used to generate entire Wikipedia articles
    through multi-document summarization.
    
    This is possible because the context
    window used by Transformer extends to
    thousands of words.
    
    With such a large context window,
    Transformer could be used for applications
    beyond text, including pixels or musical
    notes, enabling it to be used to generate
    music and images.

LSH

Reformer
    [Transformer model]

    Designed to handle context windows of up
    to 1 million words, all on a single
    accelerator and using only 16GB of memory.
    
    It combines two crucial techniques to
    solve the problems of attention and memory
    allocation that limit Transformer’s
    application to long context windows.
    
    Reformer uses LSH to reduce the complexity
    of attending over long sequences and
    reversible residual layers to more
    efficiently use the memory available.

    Algorithm:
        Takes in an input sequence of keys,
        where each key is a vector
        representing individual words (or
        pixels, in the case of images) in the
        first layer and larger contexts in
        subsequent layers.
        
        LSH is applied to the sequence, after
        which the keys are sorted by their
        hash and chunked.
        
        Attention is applied only within a
        single chunk and its immediate
        neighbors.

Reversible layers

    Trained with a simple objective: predict
    the next word, given all of the previous
    words within some text.

    The diversity of the dataset causes this
    simple goal to contain naturally occurring
    demonstrations of many tasks across
    diverse domains.

    Direct scale-up of GPT, with more than 10X

    Displays a broad set of capabilities,
    including the ability to generate
    conditional synthetic text samples of
    unprecedented quality, where we prime the
    model with an input and have it generate a
    lengthy continuation.

    Outperforms other language models trained
    on specific domains (like Wikipedia, news,
    or books) without needing to use these
    domain- specific training datasets.

    On language tasks like question answering,
    reading comprehension, summarization, and
    translation, GPT-2 begins to learn these
    tasks from the raw text, using no task-
    specific training data.

    While scores on these downstream tasks are
    far from state-of-the-art, they suggest
    that the tasks can benefit from
    unsupervised techniques, given sufficient
    (unlabeled) data and compute.

cognitive grammar
    A cognitive approach to language developed
    by Ronald Langacker, which hypothesizes
    that grammar, semantics, and lexicon exist
    on a continuum instead of as separate
    processes altogether.
    
    This approach to language was one of the
    first projects of cognitive linguistics.
    
    In this system, grammar is not a formal
    system operating independently of meaning.
    
    Rather, grammar is itself meaningful and
    inextricable from semantics.
    
    Construction grammar is a similar foci of
    cognitive approaches to grammar.
    
    While cognitive grammar emphasizes the
    study of the cognitive principles that
    give rise to linguistic organization,
    construction grammar aims to provide a

    Langacker first explicates the system of
    cognitive grammar in his seminal, two-
    volume work Foundations of Cognitive
    Grammar.
    
    Volume one is titled "Theoretical
    Prerequisites", and it explores
    Langacker's hypothesis that grammar may be
    deconstructed into patterns that come
    together in order to represent concepts.
    
    This volume concentrates on the broad
    scope of language especially in terms of

    the tools presented in Foundations' first
    volume in a wide range of, mainly English,

Pattern-Exploiting Training (PET)
    [#fine-tuning]

    PET is a technique for fine-tuning a pre-
    trained LM that generates additional
    "soft-labeled" training data from
    unlabeled examples.

    This helps the model improve performance
    in "few-shot" scenarios, such as NLP
    benchmarks which have very few labeled
    examples for fine-tuning.

    Using PET, the researchers fine-tuned an
    ALBERT Transformer model and achieved an
    average score of 76.8 on the SuperGLUE
    benchmark, compared to GPT-3's 71.8.

    Abstract:

    Some NLP tasks can be solved in a fully
    unsupervised fashion by providing a
    pretrained LM with "task descriptions" in
    NL (e.g., Radford et al., 2019). While
    this approach underperforms its supervised
    counterpart, we show in this work that the
    two ideas can be combined: We introduce
    Pattern-Exploiting Training (PET), a semi-
    supervised training procedure that
    reformulates input examples as cloze-style
    phrases to help LMs understand a given
    task. These phrases are then used to
    assign soft labels to a large set of
    unlabeled examples. Finally, regular
    supervised training is performed on the
    resulting training set. For several tasks
    and languages, PET outperforms both
    supervised training and unsupervised
    approaches in low-resource settings by a
    large margin.

out-of-vocabulary
OOV
    A limitation of word embeddings are that,
    they are learned by the NL Model
    (word2vec, GloVe and the like) and
    therefore words must have been seen in the
    training data before, in order to have an
    embedding.

    There are ways to handle OOV words and
    create embeddings for them.

    movie review as good or bad.

    There is only one output label for the
    entire input sequence.

token-level classification

    Each token (element in the sequence) will
    have a corresponding label in the output.

Latent Dirichlet allocation
LDA
    A generative statistical model that allows
    sets of observations to be explained by
    unobserved groups that explain why some
    parts of the data are similar.
    
    For example, if observations are words
    collected into documents, it posits that
    each document is a mixture of a small
    number of topics and that each word's
    presence is attributable to one of the
    document's topics.
    
    LDA is an example of a topic model and
    belongs to the ML toolbox and in wider
    sense to the artificial intelligence
    toolbox.

topic modelling
topic model
    [NLP task]

    A type of statistical model for
    discovering the abstract "topics" that
    occur in a collection of documents.
    
    Topic modeling is a frequently used text-
    mining tool for discovery of hidden
    semantic structures in a text body.

embeddings
    vim +/"vectors = np.load('dataset\/glove.6B.300d.npy')" "$MYGIT/mullikine/codenames/codenames.py"

    'npy' files.

context vector
    [word vector embedding]

    The hidden state from the last unit is
    known as the 'context vector'.

    This contains information about the input
    sequence.

    See "word vector":
        vim +/"word vector" "$NOTES/glossary.txt"

word vector
word vector embedding
    Obtained using two methods (both involving
    Neural Networks):
    - Skip Gram, and
    - Common Bag Of Words (CBOW)

    Limitations:
    - they presume incorrectly that a word’s
      meaning is relatively stable across
      sentences.

      Polysemy abounds, and we must beware of
      massive differences in meaning for a
      single word:
        e.g.
        - lit (an adjective that describes
        something burning) and lit (an
        abbreviation for literature); or get
        (a verb for obtaining) and get (an
        animal’s offspring).

    The optimal dimensionality of word
    embeddings is mostly task-dependent:
    - a smaller dimensionality works better
      for more syntactic tasks such as named
      entity recognition or part-of-speech
      (POS) tagging, while
    - a larger dimensionality is more useful
      for more semantic tasks such as
      sentiment analysis.

    Fixed-length vector representations.

    Useful for document retrieval and word
    sense disambiguation.

    Motivated by four goals:
    - Capture “similarity of use” among words
      “car” is similar to “auto”, but not
      similar to “hippopotamus”.
    - Quickly find constituent objects
      eg., documents that contain specified words.
    - Generate context vectors automatically
      from an unlabeled corpus.
    - Use context vectors as input to standard
      learning algorithms.

    Lack, however, a natural way to represent
    syntax, discourse, or logic.

    Accommodating all these capabilities into
    a “Grand Unified Representation” is, we
    maintain, a prerequisite for solving the
    most difficult problems in Artificial
    Intelligence, including natural language
    understanding.

    The dot product of the CV for “car” with
    CV’s of documents containing “car” to be
    larger than the dot product of the CV for
    “car”.

distributed representations
    A way of mapping or encoding information
    to some physical medium such as a memory
    or neural network.

autoencoding models
    See MLM

autoregressive models
    See CLM

CLM
causal language modeling
    A pretraining task where the model reads
    the texts in order and has to predict the
    next word.
    
    It’s usually done by reading the whole
    sentence but using a mask inside the model
    to hide the future tokens at a certain
    timestep.

deep learning: 
    Machine learning algorithms which uses
    neural networks with several layers.

MLM
Masked language modeling
    A pretraining task where the model sees a
    corrupted version of the texts, usually
    done by masking some tokens randomly, and
    has to predict the original text.

multimodal
    A task that combines texts with another
    kind of inputs (for instance images).

NLG
Natural language generation
    All tasks related to generating text (for
    instance talk with transformers,
    translation).

NLP
Natural language processing
    A generic way to say “deal with texts”.

NLU
Natural language understanding
    All tasks related to understanding what is
    in a text (for instance classifying the
    whole text, individual words).

pretrained model
    A model that has been pretrained on some
    data (for instance all of Wikipedia).
    Pretraining methods involve a
    self-supervised objective, which can be
    reading the text and trying to predict the
    next word (see CLM) or masking some words
    and trying to predict them (see MLM).

RNN
Recurrent neural network
    A type of model that uses a loop over a
    layer to process texts.

self-attention
    Each element of the input finds out which
    other elements of the input they should
    attend to.

self-attention layer
    [#transformer]

    A layer that helps the encoder look at
    other words in the input sentence as it
    encodes a specific word.

seq2seq
sequence-to-sequence
    Models that generate a new sequence from
    an input, like translation models, or
    summarization models (such as Bart or T5).

token
    A part of a sentence, usually a word, but
    can also be a subword (non-common words
    are often split in subwords) or a
    punctuation symbol.

transformer
    Self-attention based deep learning model
    architecture.

contrastive pre-training
    Pre-training methods are becoming more and
    more popular over the last few years and
    have revolutionized NLP.
    
    The model starts off with contrastive pre-
    training where image text pairs are
    matched with the similarity from a batch
    of images.
    
    This is done using an image encoder and a
    text encoder.
    
    Contrastive pre-training attempts to learn
    noise invariant sequence representations
    which encourage consistency between the
    learned representations and the original
    sequence.
    
    They got the inspiration from VirTex which
    is a pretraining approach using
    semantically dense captions to learn
    visual representations.
    
    This approach has been shown to surpass
    other supervised approaches such as
    classic high-end ImageNet networks.

    See "contrastive learning".

Text simplification
    An operation used in NLP to modify,
    enhance, classify or otherwise process an
    existing corpus of human-readable text in
    such a way that the grammar and structure
    of the prose is greatly simplified, while
    the underlying meaning and information
    remains the same.
    
    Text simplification is an important area
    of research, because natural human
    languages ordinarily contain large
    vocabularies and complex compound
    constructions that are not easily
    processed through automation.
    
    In terms of reducing language diversity,
    semantic compression can be employed to
    limit and simplify a set of words used in
    given texts.

language model
LM
statistical language model
    Requires
    - word embeddings

    Provides
    - Language modeling

    Metrics
    - Predict the next word in the sentence

    Traning involves learning the likelihood
    of occurrence of a word based on the
    previous sequence of words used in the
    text.

    Can be operated at:
    - character level,
    - n-gram level,
    - sentence level, or even
    - paragraph level.

    A probability distribution over sequences
    of words.
    
    Given such a sequence, say of length m, it
    assigns a probability to the whole
    sequence.
    
    The language model provides context to
    distinguish between words and phrases that
    sound similar.

    http://stephantul.github.io/python/pytorch/2020/09/18/fast_topk/

    An LM is a statistical mechanism that
    tries to predict a token, usually a word,
    given some context.
    
    As a statistical mechanism, it thus
    defines a probability distribution over a
    fixed vocabulary V.
    
    The context is usually other tokens from
    V, and usually consists of the preceding
    tokens.
    
    So, at a given time-step, a LM produces a
    vector of probabilities over the entire
    vocabulary.
    
    Given the true targets, we can then assess
    the quality of the LM by, for example,
    calculating the cross entropy.

anaphora
    The use of an expression whose
    interpretation depends upon another
    expression in context (its antecedent or
    postcedent).
    
    In a narrower sense, anaphora is the use
    of an expression that depends specifically
    upon an antecedent expression and thus is
    contrasted with cataphora, which is the
    use of an expression that depends upon a
    postcedent expression.
    
    The anaphoric (referring) term is called
    an anaphor.
    
    For example, in the sentence Sally
    arrived, but nobody saw her, the pronoun
    her is an anaphor, referring back to the
    antecedent Sally.

anaphora resolution
    There are many theories that attempt to
    prove how anaphors are related and trace
    back to their antecedents, with centering
    theory (Grosz, Joshi, and Weinstein 1983)
    being one of them.
    
    Taking the computational theory of mind
    view of language, centering theory gives a
    computational analysis of underlying
    antecedents.
    
    In their original theory, Grosz, Joshi, &
    Weinstein (1983) propose that some
    discourse entities in utterances are more
    "central" than others, and this degree of
    centrality imposes constraints on what can
    be the antecedent.

    In the theory, there are different types
    of centers: forward facing, backwards
    facing, and preferred.

    Forward facing centers
        A ranked list of discourse entities in
        an utterance. The ranking is debated,
        some focusing on theta relations
        (Yıldırım et al. 2004) and some
        providing definitive lists.

    Backwards facing center
        The highest ranked discourse entity in the previous utterance.

    Preferred center
        The highest ranked discourse entity in
        the previous utterance realised in the
        current utterance.

word sense disambiguation
