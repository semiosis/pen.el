My thoughts and bible references:

Firstly, I like Alistair Begg's compassion.

Matthew 19:4-9 - He answered, Have you not read that he who created them from the beginning made them male and female, and said, Therefore a man shall leave his father and his mother and hold fast to his wife, and they shall become one flesh? So they are no longer two but one flesh. What therefore God has joined together, let not man separate. They said to him, Why then did Moses command one to give a certificate of divorce and to send her away? He said to them, Because of your hardness of heart Moses allowed you to divorce your wives, but from the beginning it was not so. And I say to you: whoever divorces his wife, except for sexual immorality, and marries another, commits adultery. (ESV)

Matthew 5:14-20 - You are the light of the world. A city set on a hill cannot be hidden. Nor do people light a lamp and put it under a basket, but on a stand, and it gives light to all in the house. In the same way, let your light shine before others, so that they may see your good works and give glory to your Father who is in heaven. Do not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them. For truly, I say to you, until heaven and earth pass away, not an iota, not a dot, will pass from the Law until all is accomplished. Therefore whoever relaxes one of the least of these commandments and teaches others to do the same will be called least in the kingdom of heaven, but whoever does them and teaches them will be called great in the kingdom of heaven. For I tell you, unless your righteousness exceeds that of the scribes and Pharisees, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven. (ESV)

Leviticus 18:22 - You shall not lie with a male as with a woman; it is an abomination.  (ESV)

Romans 7:22 - For I delight in the law of God, in my inner being, (ESV)

Romans 9:31-32 - but that Israel who pursued a law that would lead to righteousness did not succeed in reaching that law. Why? Because they did not pursue it by faith, but as if it were based on works. They have stumbled over the stumbling stone, (ESV)

The most important thing though is faith because it applies to both the adherent of the law and also the Gentile who has faith.

Romans 4:16 - That is why it depends on faith, in order that the promise may rest on grace and be guaranteed to all his offspring—not only to the adherent of the law but also to the one who shares the faith of Abraham, who is the father of us all, (ESV)

Luke 7:47 - Therefore I tell you, her sins, which are many, are forgiven—for she loved much.  But he who is forgiven little, loves little.  (ESV)

I currently believe this means that grace exists for gay people who have faith in Jesus but those who annul and teach others to break the law will be called least in the kingdom. i.e. those who keep God's commandments and AND the righteousness of faith / the testimony of Jesus will be called great in the kingdom, and the grace if there is any for those who practice homosexuality or any abominable thing or for those who practice deceit most likely does not extend to them being allowed into heaven.

This is my current understanding. Is this correct?

Also, the Kingdom stretches from heaven to earth, so gay marriage may happen on earth but such a thing could never exist in heaven.

Matthew 6:10 - Your kingdom come, your will be done, on earth as it is in heaven.

The question is, which I do not have the answer for, is there any place for it in God's kingdom anywhere down?

In Matthew 5:14-20 it looks like there is some potential grace despite annulling commandments, but I don't really see the grace for practicing sinful things with knowledge of the law.

I John 2:29: If you know that he is righteous, you may be sure that everyone who practices righteousness has been born of him.
I John 3:5: You know that he appeared to take away sins, and in him there is no sin.
I John 3:6: No one who abides in him keeps on sinning; no one who keeps on sinning has either seen him or known him.
I John 3:7: Little children, let no one deceive you. Whoever practices righteousness is righteous, as he is righteou

I personally do not endorse gay marriage. When I have in the past, I repent of
that. In the manner in which I judge, I know I will be judged. So I believe
that because I do not / no longer endorse gay marriage for others, I do not
endorse it for myself, and I'll be held to that standard.

Matthew 7:2: For with the judgment you pronounce you will be judged, and with the measure you use it will be measured to you.

I know I am called to exercise personal righteousness as
the light of the world. I believe that God's grace extends to all who put their
faith in Jesus and have Jesus' righteousness imputed onto them, the
righteousness of faith in Jesus Christ God's Son who has paid through his blood
the price for our sin.

I also currently believe that one's response to
forgiveness must be like the woman Jesus mentions in Luke 7:47 - with a PROPROTIONAL love for Jesus.

I believe one must know that God's law is right and when presented with God's law, they recognise that the law is right
and recognise their transgression.

I believe that the Holy Spirit goes to those who obey God and I believe belief in Jesus comes first.

John 5:38: You do not have His word abiding in you, for you do not believe Him whom He sent.

Acts 2:38 - And Peter said to them, Repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins, and you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit. (ESV)

Acts 5:32 - And we are witnesses to these things, and so is the Holy Spirit, whom God has given to those who obey him. (ESV)

Belief in Jesus comes first but receiving the Holy Spirit and baptism may happen in any order after that.

I think this is generally the order of things. But God is sovereign to reveal Himself.

Romans 10:20 - Then Isaiah is so bold as to say, I have been found by those who did not seek me; I have shown myself to those who did not ask for me. (ESV)

I also believe 1 Cor 12:3.

1 Corinthians 12:3 - Therefore I want you to understand that no one speaking in the Spirit of God ever says Jesus is accursed! and no one can say Jesus is Lord except in the Holy Spirit. (ESV)

Mark 16:16-17 - Whoever believes and is baptized will be saved, but whoever does not believe will be condemned. And these signs will accompany those who believe: in my name they will cast out demons; they will speak in new tongues; (ESV)

I believe that repentance is important in faith and faithfulness to God.

If a newly born-again Christian is spending all their time with sinners though and endorsing continually instead of being discipled, then they can
have their mind conformed to the sinners instead of being strengthened in the truth. This is why I think it's not especially great to, immediately after getting born-again,
be overly exposed to unbelievers and sinners.

Jesus ate with sinners but Jesus was the special guest. Think of Nicodemus inviting Jesus over.

Celebrating/endorsing sin / error is not right.

But at the end of the day, justification by faith in Jesus justifies the ungodly sinner - but it is faith that justifies and not faithlessness. It's the type of belief that recognises one's sin, and results in love for Jesus, and it's obedient and submissive to God - it's repentant.

Where we are unfaithful, though, God is faithful. God wants us to choose Him. He wants us to repent.

God's original design is male and female union and also the law reflects the spiritual reality.

The law still exists. A thought I have : "Perhaps structure of God's kingdom might be determined by the law and Jesus' words."

Hebrews 1:3 - He is the radiance of the glory of God and the exact imprint of his nature, and he upholds the universe by the word of his power. After making purification for sins, he sat down at the right hand of the Majesty on high, (ESV)

Revelation of John 20:4 - Then I saw thrones, and seated on them were those to whom the authority to judge was committed. Also I saw the souls of those who had been beheaded for the testimony of Jesus and for the word of God, and who had not worshiped the beast or its image and had not received its mark on their foreheads or their hands. They came to life and reigned with Christ for a thousand years.

There is no sexual immorality in heaven, no violence, no sinners.

Revelation 21:22-27 - And I saw no temple in the city, for its temple is the Lord God the Almighty and the Lamb. And the city has no need of sun or moon to shine on it, for the glory of God gives it light, and its lamp is the Lamb. By its light will the nations walk, and the kings of the earth will bring their glory into it, and its gates will never be shut by day—and there will be no night there. They will bring into it the glory and the honor of the nations. But nothing unclean will ever enter it, nor anyone who does what is detestable or false, but only those who are written in the Lamb's book of life. (ESV)

Isaiah 11:6 - The wolf shall dwell with the lamb, and the leopard shall lie down with the young goat, and the calf and the lion and the fattened calf together; and a little child shall lead them. (ESV)

Matthew 22:30: For in the resurrection they neither marry nor are given in marriage, but are like angels in heaven.

But adhering to the law like a pharisee is like strapping yourself to a razor blade, but that doesn't mean the law is wrong.

Romans 3:20: For by works of the law no human being will be justified in his sight, since through the law comes knowledge of sin.

Mercy, not sacrifice.

Acts 23:3: Then Paul said to him, God is going to strike you, you whitewashed wall! Are you sitting to judge me according to the law, and yet contrary to the law you order me to be struck?

Matthew 12:3-8 - He said to them, Have you not read what David did when he was hungry, and those who were with him: how he entered the house of God and ate the bread of the Presence, which it was not lawful for him to eat nor for those who were with him, but only for the priests?  Or have you not read in the Law how on the Sabbath the priests in the temple profane the Sabbath and are guiltless?  I tell you, something greater than the temple is here.  And if you had known what this means, I desire mercy, and not sacrifice, you would not have condemned the guiltless.  For the Son of Man is lord of the Sabbath.

The law is good and it still exists, and God still uses the law. All of it. But when we try to use it ourselves to judge others, we so easily make ourselves hypocrites.
We are supposed to stand for truth and live righteously as the light of the world.
We keep ourselves accountable to God, and follow the law by faith and not works.
God knows when we lie, and God knows when we cheat and do detestable things - even in our thoughts.
That being said, we all fall short of the glory of God.

Jesus Christ is the end of the law to all who believe, but grace isn't an excuse to sin.
We are now under Christ's law.

Jesus didn't come to judge but to save, but He did give us words that will judge us, and He did come for judgement.

John 9:39: Jesus said, For judgment I came into this world, that those who do not see may see, and those who see may become blind.
Matthew 5:21: You have heard that it was said to those of old, You shall not murder; and whoever murders will be liable to judgment.
Matthew 5:22: But I say to you that everyone who is angry with his brother will be liable to judgment; whoever insults his brother will be liable to the council; and whoever says, You fool! will be liable to the hell of fire.
John 3:19: And this is the judgment: the light has come into the world, and people loved the darkness rather than the light because their deeds were evil.
John 5:24: Truly, truly, I say to you, whoever hears my word and believes him who sent me has eternal life. He does not come into judgment, but has passed from death to life.
John 5:27: And he has given him authority to execute judgment, because he is the Son of Man.
John 5:29: and come out, those who have done good to the resurrection of life, and those who have done evil to the resurrection of judgment.
John 12:47: If anyone hears my words and does not keep them, I do not judge him; for I did not come to judge the world but to save the world.
John 12:48: The one who rejects me and does not receive my words has a judge; the word that I have spoken will judge him on the last day.
John 13:34: A new commandment I give to you, that you love one another: just as I have loved you, you also are to love one another.
John 13:35: By this all people will know that you are my disciples, if you have love for one another.

Jesus must be received if one wants to become a child of God, receiving Him involves receiving His words. This is an action we must take.

John 1:12: But to all who did receive him, who believed in his name, he gave the right to become children of God,

Jesus' words are what judges us when we are brought before the judgement seat.

God is the judge.

John 12:48 - The one who rejects me and does not receive my words has a judge; the word that I have spoken will judge him on the last day. (ESV)

We must still love one another as He commanded us, as He loved us.

I wouldn't mind feedback on this. I put my thoughts out there but I am looking for edification. Jesus' words will be the final judge.

Jesus Christ is Lord and is my Lord.
I believe I'm being led into all the truth. Am I there yet? I'm still being led into all the truth.
