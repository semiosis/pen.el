* Pen Tutorial
This is a tutorial for how to use =pen.el=.

The following command starts =pen.el=. You
only need to have docker installed and an
=OpenAI GPT-3= key to try this out.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh -n :sps bash :async :results none
  docker run --rm -ti --entrypoint= semiosis/pen.el:latest ./run.sh

  # And to update the image
  docker pull semiosis/pen.el:latest
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_SRC sh -n :sps bash :async :results none
  # For windows
  docker.exe run --rm -ti --entrypoint= semiosis/pen.el:latest ./run.sh

  # You may need winpty
  git clone https://github.com/rprichard/winpty
  winpty docker.exe run --rm -ti --entrypoint= semiosis/pen.el:latest ./run.sh

For =GPT-neo=, =GPT-2= and =booste= support,
and latest updates, please install from master
branch. Docker support coming. =GPT-j= also in
the works.

=H= is the Hyper key, which works similar to Escape, Meta, Alt, Control or Shift that is present on the Space Cadet Keyboard.

=pen.el= emulates a Hyper key (=H-=) with =C-M-\=.

I like =Hyper= because you're writing =hyperreality=.

#+BEGIN_SRC text -n :async :results verbatim code
  hyperreality
      [#semiotics]
      [#postmodernism]

      An inability of consciousness to
      distinguish reality from a simulation of
      reality, especially in technologically
      advanced postmodern societies.

*** Usage
Running =pen-generate-prompt-functions= will
load all prompts from the prompts directory,
which is typically located here: =~/.emacs.d/prompts=.

Running =pen-run-prompt-function= will run a prompt function.

You may also press =SPC= while some text is selected to run a prompt function.

This is a prompt which, given text selected
will output the language that text is in.

It works for both world languages and for code.

The =title= of the prompt will be
[[https://pypi.org/project/python-slugify/][slugified]] and used as the name of
the prompt function.

=doc= and =notes= will both go into the
documentation for the function.

The prompt is using the =Input= =Output=
pattern.

=engine= is the name of a language model.

An API such as the =OpenAI API= (=GPT-3=) may serve
several different models.

+ Some alternative models for =GPT-3=:
  - babbage
  - content-filter-alpha-c4
  - content-filter-dev
  - curie
  - cursing-filter-v6
  - davinci
  - instruct-curie-beta
  - instruct-davinci-beta

=vars= is a list of variable names. Each
variable is substituted into the prompt if it
has a corresponding template placeholder.

For example, the =<1>= in the prompt
corresponds to where the first variable
(=text-or-code=) will be substituted.

=examples= is a list with the same number of
elements as =vars=. The values in =examples=
may be suggested as initial input when
running the prompt function and may be used in
test cases. They also serve as documentation
for the user.

=preprocessors= are a list of shell
pipelineable commands (stream filters) which
expect both input and output and can be used
to preprocess the variables before they are
substituted into the prompt template.

This prompt doesn't have a =postprocessor=,
but if it did it would postprocess the
returned completions in a similar fashion to
how the variables are preprocessed.

Finally, =aliases= is a list of alternative
function names for this prompt.

*** Prompt Engineering Workflow

+ Setup
  - Install =prompt= snippet into yasnippet.
  - M-x =yas/reload-all=
  - M-x =yas-insert-snippet=

+ Prompt design
  - 1. Come up with a task. Let's call it "Negate sentence"
  - 2. Insert the prompt snippet into a new prompt file.
  - 3. Remove keys from prompts file which we don't need.
  - 4. =var-defaults= is an advanced usage of prompts
    - But we will remove them
  - 5. Now load the prompt with =M-x pen-generate-prompt-functions=
  - 6. Now look at the prompt function documentation
    - The binding =C-h C-f= is used to bring up help for a function
  - 7. Looks like we made an error: "The Mars is very far away."
    - Change it and update the version of the prompt
  - 8. Reload functions

Test it out.

Maori isn't a very prominent language on the
web, but it still managed to capture the idea
of a welcome message, which I think is
amazing! I am Maori, so I appreciate this!

I want to demonstrate the usage of two more =.prompt= keys.

+ The technical jargon :: =var-defaults= overrides the default behaviour of the =(interactive)= form in emacs.

By specifying =var-defaults=, you can change
what functions or expressions are run to
acquire the values for the parameters to the
prompt.

The prompt here captures the selected text and
puts it into the second placeholder, =<2>=.

By default, that would go into the first one, =<1>=.

** Using prompt functions in your code
Prompt functions automatically 'curry' when
you leave out their arguments.

Here is an example, =pf-translate-from-world-language-x-to-y/3=:

#+BEGIN_SRC text -n :async :results verbatim code
  pf-translate-from-world-language-x-to-y/3 is an interactive function
  defined in pen-example-config.el.

  Signature
  (pf-translate-from-world-language-x-to-y/3 &optional FROM-LANGUAGE TO-LANGUAGE PHRASE)

  Documentation
  Translate from world language X to Y
  This prompt translates English text to any world langauge

  path:
  - /home/shane/source/git/spacemacs/prompts/prompts/translate-world-languages.prompt

  examples:
  - English
  - French
  - Goodnight

  preprocessors:
  - cat
  - cat
  - sed -z 's/\n/\\n/g'

  var-defaults:
  - (read-string-hist "Pen From language: ")
  - (read-string-hist "Pen To language: ")
  - (pen-selected-text)

  prompt-filter:
  - pen-c ascify
#+END_SRC

If this function is run without a selection
then =pen-selected-text= will resort to asking
the user for input.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp -n :async :results verbatim code
  ;; Leave out all arguments to be prompted for each argument
  (pf-translate-from-world-language-x-to-y/3)
#+END_SRC

The following default functions / expressions
(i.e. =var-defaults=) are run when called
interactively or to acquire the values of
optional parameters that were left out of the
call to the prompt function.

#+BEGIN_SRC yaml -n :async :results verbatim code
  var-defaults:
  - "(read-string-hist \"Pen From language: \")"
  - "(read-string-hist \"Pen To language: \")"
  - "(pen-selected-text)"

The following invocation supplies ="French"=
as the first parameter, but the others will be
requested.

I'm trying to do something a little more
ambitious than simply having a single
completion function.

There will be infinitely many completion functions that you can select from.
