Faith without obedience (at least an obedient heart) is not faith at all. We need to obey Jesus Christ.

*John 3:36* - He who believes in the Son has eternal life; but he who does not obey the Son will not see life, but the wrath of God abides on him.” (ESV)

The word pisteuo is the verb for pistis (faith). So where it says 'believe', it really means 'faithing'.

The Old Testament makes us wise for salvation through faith in Jesus Christ:

*II Timothy 3:12-17* - Indeed, all who desire to live a godly life in Christ Jesus will be persecuted, while evil people and impostors will go on from bad to worse, deceiving and being deceived. But as for you, continue in what you have learned and have firmly believed, knowing from whom you learned it and how from childhood you have been *acquainted with the sacred writings*, which _are able to make you wise for salvation through faith in Christ Jesus_. All Scripture is breathed out by God and profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, and for training in righteousness, that the man of God may be competent, equipped for every good work. (ESV)

Abraham received the promise because he obeyed God:

*Genesis 22:18* - and in your offspring shall all the nations of the earth be blessed, because you have obeyed my voice. (ESV)

Those who walk in the footsteps of the faith that Abraham had before he was circumcised may be counted as Abraham's children:

*Romans 4:9-12* - Is this blessing then only for the circumcised, or also for the uncircumcised? We say that faith was counted to Abraham as righteousness. How then was it counted to him? Was it before or after he had been circumcised? It was not after, but before he was circumcised. He received the sign of circumcision as a seal of the righteousness that he had by faith while he was still uncircumcised. The purpose was to make him the father of all who believe (G4100 pisteuo) without being circumcised, so that righteousness would be counted to them as well, and to make him the father of the circumcised who are not merely circumcised but who also walk in the footsteps of the faith that our father Abraham had before he was circumcised.

That's what it means to share in the faith of Abraham, to walk in the way he walked:

*Romans 4:13-17* - For the promise to Abraham and his offspring that he would be heir of the world did not come through the law but through the righteousness of faith. For if it is the adherents of the law who are to be the heirs, faith is null and the promise is void. For the law brings wrath, but where there is no law there is no transgression. That is why it depends on faith, in order that the promise may rest on grace and be guaranteed to all his offspring—not only to the adherent of the law but also to the one who shares the faith of Abraham, who is the father of us all, as it is written, I have made you the father of many nations—in the presence of the God in whom he believed, who gives life to the dead and calls into existence the things that do not exist.

The Holy Spirit goes to those who obey Jesus Christ:

*Acts 5:32* - And we are witnesses to these things, and so is *the Holy Spirit, whom God has given to those who obey him*. (ESV)

The Holy Spirit is received through faith:

*Galatians 3:14* - so that in Christ Jesus the blessing of Abraham might come to the Gentiles, so that we might *receive the promised Spirit through faith*. (ESV)

Faith involves belief and obedience.

We may rest from our labors when we die in the Lord:

*Revelation of John 14:13* - And I heard a voice from heaven saying, Write this: Blessed are the dead who die in the Lord from now on. Blessed indeed, says the Spirit, that they may rest from their labors, for their deeds follow them! (ESV)

Paul the Apostle says that he honours the the Son in his body, whether by life or by death:

*Philippians 1:15-22* - Some indeed preach Christ from envy and rivalry, but others from good will. The latter do it out of love, knowing that I am put here for the defense of the gospel. The former proclaim Christ out of rivalry, not sincerely but thinking to afflict me in my imprisonment. What then? Only that in every way, whether in pretense or in truth, Christ is proclaimed, and in that I rejoice. Yes, and I will rejoice, for I know that through your prayers and the help of the Spirit of Jesus Christ this will turn out for my deliverance, as _it is my eager expectation and hope that I will not be at all ashamed, but that with full courage now as always Christ will be honored in my body, whether by life or by death_. For to me to live is Christ, and to die is gain. _If I am to live in the flesh, that means fruitful labor for me._ Yet which I shall choose I cannot tell.

We _must honour Jesus Christ in our bodies and in our lives_ - fruitful labour, so that we can be confident with =John 5-24=:

*John 5:21-24* - For as the Father raises the dead and gives them life, so also the Son gives life to whom he will. The Father judges no one, but has given all judgment to the Son, that all may honor the Son, just as they honor the Father. _Whoever does not honor the Son does not honor the Father who sent him_. Truly, truly, I say to you, whoever _hears my word and believes (G4100 *pisteuo*) him who sent me has eternal life_. He does not come into judgment, but has passed from death to life.

Faith includes both belief and obedience. We have faith in God and faith in Jesus Christ. The work of God is to believe on Jesus Christ - yes, and that involves obedience.

You need to be willing to do His will:

*John 7:17* - If anyone is willing to do His will, he will know of the teaching, whether it is of God or whether I speak from Myself. (ESV)
