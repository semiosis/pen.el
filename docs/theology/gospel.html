<div id="outline-container-org1156d57" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org1156d57"><span class="section-number-2">1.</span> Gospel</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1">
<blockquote>
<p>
<b>John 3:16-21</b> - For God so loved the world, that he gave his only Son, that whoever (G3956 pas) believes (G4100 pisteuo) in him should not perish but have eternal life. For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but in order that the world might be saved through him. Whoever believes in him is not condemned, but whoever does not believe is condemned already, because he has not believed in the name of the only Son of God. And this is the judgment: the light has come into the world, and people loved the darkness rather than the light because their deeds were evil. For everyone who does wicked things hates the light and does not come to the light, lest his deeds should be exposed. But <span class="underline">whoever does what is true comes to the light</span>, so that <span class="underline">it may be clearly seen that his deeds have been carried out in God</span>. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The gospel involves deeds being carried out in God.
</p>

<p>
Whoever <span class="underline">does what is true comes to the light.</span>
</p>

<p>
<span class="underline">Whoever has faith in and puts their trust in in Jesus Christ is not condemned and should not perish.</span>
</p>

<p>
We must honour Jesus Christ:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>John 5:21-24</b> - For as the Father raises the dead and gives them life, so also the Son gives life to whom he will. The Father judges no one, but has given all judgment to the Son, that all may honor the Son, just as they honor the Father. <span class="underline">Whoever does not honor the Son does not honor the Father who sent him</span>. Truly, truly, I say to you, whoever <span class="underline">hears my word and believes (G4100 <b>pisteuo</b>) him who sent me has eternal life</span>. He does not come into judgment, but has passed from death to life.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
I believe <code>John 5:24</code> is a true statement and that it should not be read outside of the words Jesus said directly before it (<code>Whoever does not honor the Son does not honor the Father who sent him</code>).
</p>

<p>
We do not nullify the rest of what Jesus has commanded of and asked of us. If Jesus is your judge, then I think it's wise to take on board the rest of what Jesus has said:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Philippians 1:15-22</b> - Some indeed preach Christ from envy and rivalry, but others from good will. The latter do it out of love, knowing that I am put here for the defense of the gospel. The former proclaim Christ out of rivalry, not sincerely but thinking to afflict me in my imprisonment. What then? Only that in every way, whether in pretense or in truth, Christ is proclaimed, and in that I rejoice. Yes, and I will rejoice, for I know that through your prayers and the help of the Spirit of Jesus Christ this will turn out for my deliverance, as <span class="underline">it is my eager expectation and hope that I will not be at all ashamed, but that with full courage now as always Christ will be honored in my body, whether by life or by death</span>. For to me to live is Christ, and to die is gain. <span class="underline">If I am to live in the flesh, that means fruitful labor for me.</span> Yet which I shall choose I cannot tell.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
We're not justified through the works of the law but through faith, and faith involves obedience to Jesus Christ:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Galatians 2:15-16</b> - “We are Jews by nature and not sinners from among the Gentiles; nevertheless knowing that a man is not justified by the works of the Law but through faith in Christ Jesus, even we have believed in Christ Jesus, so that we may be <b>justified by faith in Christ</b> and not by the works of the Law; since by the works of the Law no flesh will be justified.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
It's by faith in Christ that we are justified, and faith involves obedience (at least of the heart).
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>John 3:36</b> - Whoever believes (G4100 pisteuo) in the Son has eternal life; whoever does not <b>obey</b> the Son shall not see life, but the wrath of God remains on him. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
It's faith in the heart which we need. Obedience and believe in the heart.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>John 3:16</b> - For God so loved the world, that he gave his only Son, that whoever believes (G4100 pisteuo) in him should not perish but have eternal life. (ESV)

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>1 John 3:23</b> - And this is his commandment, that we believe in the name of his Son Jesus Christ and love one another, just as he has commanded us. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Matthew 22:37-39</b> - And he said to him, You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind. This is the great and first commandment. And a second is like it: You shall love your neighbor as yourself. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Jesus Christ is the Son of the Living God. Believing on His name is God's will for us, and loving one another is God's will for us as He has commanded. There is more that Jesus has commanded us, too.
</p>

<p>
The promise to Gentiles:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Galatians 3:8</b> - And the Scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the Gentiles by faith, preached the gospel beforehand to Abraham, saying, In you shall all the nations be blessed. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Genesis 12:3</b> - I will bless those who bless you, and him who dishonors you I will curse, and in you all the families of the earth shall be blessed. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Because Abraham <span class="underline">obeyed God's voice</span>:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Genesis 22:18</b> - and in your offspring shall all the nations of the earth be blessed, because you have obeyed my voice. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Repentance and coming to the light are absolutely part of the gospel!
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>1 Corinthians 15:1-4</b> -  Now I would remind you, brothers, of the gospel I preached to you, which you received, in which you stand, and by which you are being saved, if you hold fast to the word I preached to you-unless you believed in vain.  For I delivered to you as of first importance what I also received: that Christ died for our sins in accordance with the Scriptures, that he was buried, that he was raised on the third day in accordance with the Scriptures,  (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Acts 2:47</b> - Praising God, and having favour with all the people. And the Lord added to the church daily such as should be saved. (ESV)

It is a gift to be obedient to Jesus:

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Colossians 2:18-19</b> - Let no one disqualify you, insisting on asceticism and worship of angels, going on in detail about visions, puffed up without reason by his sensuous mind, and not holding fast to the Head, from whom the whole body, nourished and knit together through its joints and ligaments, grows with a growth that is from God.

</blockquote>

<p>
Through faith, the Holy Spirit cleanses us:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Acts 15:8-9</b> - And God, who knows the heart, bore witness to them, by giving them the Holy Spirit just as he did to us, and he made no distinction between us and them, having cleansed their hearts by faith.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
By obedience to the word of God:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Ephesians 5:25-27</b> - Husbands, love your wives, as Christ loved the church and gave himself up for her, that he might sanctify her, having cleansed her by the washing of water with the word, so that he might present the church to himself in splendor, without spot or wrinkle or any such thing, that she might be holy and without blemish.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
By the Holy Spirit washing and renewing us:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Titus 3:4-6</b>- But when the goodness and loving kindness of God our Savior appeared, he saved us, not because of works done by us in righteousness, but according to his own mercy, by the washing of regeneration and renewal of the Holy Spirit, whom he poured out on us richly through Jesus Christ our Savior,
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
It's the will of God:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>I Thessalonians 4:3</b> - For this is the will of God, your sanctification: that you abstain from sexual immorality;

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>II Peter 2:19-20</b> - They promise them freedom, but they themselves are slaves of corruption. For <span class="underline">whatever overcomes a person, to that he is enslaved</span>. For if, after they have escaped the defilements of the world through the knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, they are again entangled in them and overcome, the last state has become worse for them than the first.

<p>
Therefore, the way of truth involves following Jesus and putting a stop to sin.

We must obey God. We have faith in God who was delivered up for our trespasses and raised for our justification, and having faith in God is having faith in His Son which is believing in and obeying Jesus Christ:

Confessing that Jesus is Lord is becoming obedient to Him:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Romans 10:8-9</b> - But what does it say? “The word is near you, in your mouth and in your heart”&#x2013; that is, the word (G4487 rhema) of faith (G4102 pistis) which we are preaching, that if you confess (G3670 homologeo) with your mouth Jesus as Lord, and <span class="underline">believe (G4100 <b>pisteuo</b>) in your heart</span> (G2588 kardia) that God raised Him from the dead, you will be saved; (NASB)

It's faith in the heart that a person needs.

Therefore, to arrive at the knowledge of the truth, you've got to have an obedient heart.

How can they call on Him whom they have not had faith in?

<p>
Baptism is an appeal to God for a good conscience - It's an <b>appeal</b> to God but not strictly required to be saved.
It is an appeal to God for a good conscience, through the resurrection of Jesus Christ.
I definitely believe that "believer's baptism" is the right way to perform baptism.
Baptism does save.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>I Peter 3:18-21</b> - For Christ also suffered once for sins, the righteous for the unrighteous, that he might bring us to God, being put to <b>death in the flesh but made alive in the spirit</b>, in which he went and proclaimed to the spirits in prison, because <b>they formerly did not obey</b>, when God's patience waited in the days of Noah, while the ark was being prepared, in which a few, that is, eight persons, were brought safely through water. Baptism, which corresponds to this, now saves you, not as a removal of dirt from the body but as an appeal to God for a good conscience, through the resurrection of Jesus Christ,
