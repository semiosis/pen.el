  "Cheap grace is the preaching of forgiveness
  without requiring repentance, baptism without
  church discipline.

  Communion without confession.

  Cheap grace is grace without discipleship,
  grace without the cross, grace without Jesus
  Christ."

  "Costly grace confronts us as a gracious call
  to follow Jesus, it comes as a word of
  forgiveness to the broken spirit and the
  contrite heart.

  It is costly because it compels a man to
  submit to the yoke of Christ and follow him;
  it is grace because Jesus says: "My yoke is
  easy and my burden is light."

I believe that in many ways Calvinism has gone
too far with not believing that repentance is
something we must do for our own salvation-sake.

“Forgiveness does not mean excusing.” ~C.S. Lewis
