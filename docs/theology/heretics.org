I still think God saves heretics who placed their trusting faith in Jesus, or placed their trust in God the Father of Jesus Christ by trusting Jesus, and also the circumcised who exercise Abrahams works of faith, but it's really His call - God sees the heart.
People's trust in Jesus exhibits itself in faithfully walking in the light of the Gospel of Jesus,
and Jesus' gospel involved keeping our eyes on Him, trusting Him, believing Him, obeying Him.

* That being said, it's really important to separate yourself from people who are deviating from and not being corrected by the teaching of Christ

+ [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBu7lfL492E][youtube.com: John MacArthur Witnessing to the Cults]] :: It is the nature of
    every cult to assault in some way the
    person of Jesus Christ. You have to take the warning of =II John= which says
    if somebody comes to you and and offers you something other than
    the truth about Christ, you don't want to
    have anything to do with that person.

It's really important that we *continue in the teaching of Christ and about Christ* and allow ourselves to come into agreement with the _teaching of Christ *and* about Christ_.

We should separate ourselves from people who do not stay/remain/abide in the teaching of Christ and about Christ.
If people do not want to continue in the teaching of Christ and about Christ, and they do not abide in it, and do not want to
be corrected by the Word of God, then we should separate ourselves from them.

* Marcion of Sinope
Marcionism is quite prevalent these days in
the church, which is really disappointing, and
that is why I'm putting it in this document.

+ [[https://www.thegospelcoalition.org/blogs/kevin-deyoung/marcion-getting-unhitched-old-testament/][thegospelcoalition.org: Marcion and Getting Unhitched from the Old Testament]] :: Marcion was one of the most successful heretics in the early church.
    He was opposed by everyone who was anyone.
    
    For nearly a century after his death, he was
    the arch-heretic, opposed by Polycarp (who
    called him the firstborn of Satan), Justin
    Martyr, Irenaeus, Clement, Tertullian,
    Hippolytus, and Origen.
    
    He was one of the few heretics that the Greek
    and Latin Christians united in condemning.
    
    After his excommunication, he traveled around
    the world as a missionary for his version of
    Christianity.
    
    And he won a lot of converts.
    
    According to Tertullian, he planted churches
    as “wasps make nests,” teaching men “to deny
    that God is the maker of all things in heaven
    and earth and the Christ predicted by the
    prophets is his Son.” Marcion’s church was
    rigorous, demanding, inspiring, well-
    organized, and for about a century fairly
    successful.
    
    Marcion’s theological errors (and there were
    many) came from one main root: he refused to
    believe that the God of the Old Testament was
    the same as the Father of the Lord Jesus
    Christ.
    
    Marcion simply could not believe in a God full
    of wrath and justice.
    
    So he threw away the Old Testament and took
    for his Bible a truncated version of Luke’s
    Gospel and selectively edited versions of
    Paul’s epistles.
    
    When all the cutting and pasting was finished,
    Marcion had the Christianity he wanted: a God
    of goodness and nothing else a message of
    inspiring moral uplift a Bible that does away
    with the uncomfortable bits about God’s wrath
    and hell.
    
    Marcionism was antinomian, idealistic about
    human potential, and skittish about dogma and
    rules.

So yeah, I just rebuke that spirit of Marcionism in Jesus Christ's name.

* Valentinus
[[https://www.earlychristianwritings.com/text/valentinian.html][A Valentinian Exposition]]

But I think at least they tried to conform to the image of Christ from what I can divulge, unlike most modern-day Christians.
So, yeah, a lot of modern-day Christianity is probably even more heretical than Valentinianism to be honest.

#+END_QUOTE

I think it's important to affirm that this is God's name to be remembered throughout all generations, however we are not supposed to *misuse* the LORD's name.

God is identified by many names, including:

- God (Hb. 'elohim; [[https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis%201%3A1&version=ESV][Gen. 1:1]]),
  - *[[https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis%201%3A1&version=ESV][Genesis 1:1]]* - In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth. (ESV)
- God Almighty (Hb. 'El Shadday; [[https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis%2017%3A1&version=ESV][Gen. 17:1]]),
  - *[[https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis%2017%3A1&version=ESV][Genesis 17:1]]* - When Abram was ninety-nine years old the LORD appeared to Abram and said to him, I am God Almighty; walk before me, and be blameless, (ESV)
- Lord (Hb. 'Adonay; [[https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalms%208%3A1&version=ESV][Ps. 8:1]]), and
  - *[[https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalms%208%3A1&version=ESV][Psalms 8:1]]* - O LORD, our Lord, how majestic is your name in all the earth! You have set your glory above the heavens. (ESV)
- Lord of hosts (Hb. yhwh tseba'ot; [[https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Samuel%201%3A3&version=ESV][1 Sam. 1:3]]).
  - *[[https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Samuel%201%3A3&version=ESV][I Samuel 1:3]]* - Now this man used to go up year by year from his city to worship and to sacrifice to the LORD of hosts at Shiloh, where the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, were priests of the LORD. (ESV)

In NT times, Jesus referred to God as "Father" (Gk. Pater; [[https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%206%3A9&version=ESV][Matt. 6:9]]), as did the apostles ([[https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Corinthians%201%3A3&version=ESV][1 Cor. 1:3]]).

I consider that the reason for this is simply in that we do not take the LORD's name in vain.
But we also want the LORD's name to be remembered.

# I'm still reading over the following:
# *** The Trinity

# Jehovah's Witnesses believe that the Trinity is unbiblical because the word is not in the Bible and
# because the Bible emphasizes that there is one God.

# Biblically, while it is true that there is only one God ([[https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah%2044%3A6&version=ESV][Isa. 44:6]]; [[https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah%2045%3A18&version=ESV][Isa. 45:18]]; [[https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah%2046%3A9&version=ESV][Isa. 46:9]]; [[https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%205%3A44&version=ESV][John 5:44]]; [[https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Corinthians%208%3A4&version=ESV][1 Cor. 8:4]]; [[https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=James%202%3A19&version=ESV][James 2:19]]), it is also true that three persons are called God in Scripture:

# - the Father ([[https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Pet%201%3A2&version=ESV][1 Pet. 1:2]]),
# - Jesus ([[https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%2020%3A28&version=ESV][John 20:28]]; [[https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hebrews%201%3A8&version=ESV][Heb. 1:8]]), and
# - the Holy Spirit ([[https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts%205%3A3-4&version=ESV][Acts 5:3-4]]).

# Each of these three possesses the attributes of deity-including

# - omnipresence ([[https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalms%20139%3A7&version=ESV][Ps. 139:7]]; [[https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Jeremiah%2023%3A23-24&version=ESV][Jer. 23:23-24]]; [[https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2028%3A20&version=ESV][Matt. 28:20]]),
# - omniscience ([[https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalms%20147%3A5&version=ESV][Ps. 147:5]]; [[https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%2016%3A30&version=ESV][John 16:30]]; [[https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Corinthians%202%3A10-11&version=ESV][1 Cor. 2:10-11]]),
# - omnipotence ([[https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Jeremiah%2032%3A17&version=ESV][Jer. 32:17]]; [[https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%202%3A1-11&version=ESV][John 2:1-11]]; [[https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%2015%3A19&version=ESV][Rom. 15:19]]), and
# - eternality ([[https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalms%2090%3A2&version=ESV][Ps. 90:2]]; [[https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hebrews%209%3A14&version=ESV][Heb. 9:14]]; [[https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation%2022%3A13&version=ESV][Rev. 22:13]]).

# Still further, each of the three is involved in doing the works of deity-such as creating the
# universe:

# - the Father ([[https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis%201%3A1&version=ESV][Gen. 1:1]]; [[https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalms%20102%3A25&version=ESV][Ps. 102:25]]),
# - the Son ([[https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%201%3A3&version=ESV][John 1:3]]; [[https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Colossians%201%3A16&version=ESV][Col. 1:16]]; [[https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hebrews%201%3A2&version=ESV][Heb. 1:2]]), and
# - the Holy Spirit ([[https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis%201%3A2&version=ESV][Gen. 1:2]]; [[https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Job%2033%3A4&version=ESV][Job 33:4]]; [[https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalms%20104%3A30&version=ESV][Ps. 104:30]]).

# The Bible indicates that there is three-in-oneness in the godhead ([[https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2028%3A19&version=ESV][Matt. 28:19]]; [[https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Corinthians%2013%3A14&version=ESV][2 Cor. 13:14]]).

# Thus doctrinal support for the Trinity is compellingly strong.

# *** Jesus Christ

# Jehovah's Witnesses believe that Jesus was created by Jehovah as the archangel Michael before the
# physical world existed, and is a lesser, though mighty, god.

# Biblically, however, Jesus is eternally God ([[https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%201%3A1&version=ESV][John 1:1]]; 8:58; Ex. 3:14) and has the exact same
# divine nature as the Father ([[https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%205%3A18&version=ESV][John 5:18]]; John 10:30; Heb. 1:3).

# Indeed, a comparison of the OT and NT equates Jesus with Jehovah (compare [[https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah%2043%3A11&version=ESV][Isa. 43:11]] with Titus
# 2:13; [[https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah%2044%3A24&version=ESV][Isa. 44:24]] with [[https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Colossians%201%3A16&version=ESV][Col. 1:16]]; Isa. 6:1-5 with John 12:41).

# Jesus himself created the angels ([[https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Colossians%201%3A16&version=ESV][Col. 1:16]]; [[https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%201%3A3&version=ESV][John 1:3]]; Heb. 1:2, 10) and is worshiped by them
# ([[https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hebrews%201%3A6&version=ESV][Heb. 1:6]]).

# *** The incarnation

# Jehovah's Witnesses believe that when Jesus was born on earth, he was a mere human and not God in
# human flesh.

# This violates the biblical teaching that in the incarnate Jesus, "the whole fullness of deity
# dwells bodily" ([[https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Colossians%202%3A9&version=ESV][Col. 2:9]]; Phil. 2:6-7).

# The word for "fullness" (Gk. pleroma) carries the idea of the sum total. "Deity" (Gk. theotes)
# refers to the nature, being, and attributes of God.

# Therefore, the incarnate Jesus was the sum total of the nature, being, and attributes of God in
# bodily form.

# Indeed, Jesus was Immanuel, or "God with us" ([[https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%201%3A23&version=ESV][Matt. 1:23]]; Isa. 7:14; [[https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%201%3A1&version=ESV][John 1:1]], 14, 18; 10:30;
# 14:9-10).

# *** Resurrection

# Jehovah's Witnesses believe that Jesus was resurrected spiritually from the dead, but not
# physically.

# Biblically, however, the resurrected Jesus asserted that he was not merely a spirit but had a
# flesh-and-bone body ([[https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke%2024%3A39&version=ESV][Luke 24:39]]; John 2:19-21).

# He ate food on several occasions, thereby proving that he had a genuine physical body after the
# resurrection ([[https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke%2024%3A30&version=ESV][Luke 24:30]], 42-43; John 21:12-13).

# This was confirmed by his followers who physically touched him ([[https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2028%3A9&version=ESV][Matt. 28:9]]; John 20:17).

# *** The second coming

# Jehovah's Witnesses believe that the second coming was an invisible, spiritual event that occurred
# in the year 1914.

# Biblically, however, the yet-future second coming will be physical, visible ([[https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts%201%3A9-11&version=ESV][Acts 1:9-11]]; Titus
# 2:13), and will be accompanied by visible cosmic disturbances ([[https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2024%3A29-30&version=ESV][Matt. 24:29-30]]). Every eye will see
# him ([[https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation%201%3A7&version=ESV][Rev. 1:7]]).

# *** The Holy Spirit

# Jehovah's Witnesses believe that the Holy Spirit is an impersonal force of God and not a distinct
# person.

# Biblically, however, the Holy Spirit has the three primary attributes of personality:

# - a mind ([[https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%208%3A27&version=ESV][Rom. 8:27]]),
# - emotions ([[https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians%204%3A30&version=ESV][Eph. 4:30]]), and
# - will ([[https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Corinthians%2012%3A11&version=ESV][1 Cor. 12:11]]).

# Moreover, personal pronouns are used of him ([[https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts%2013%3A2&version=ESV][Acts 13:2]]). Also, he does things that only a person
# can do, including:

# - teaching ([[https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%2014%3A26&version=ESV][John 14:26]]),
# - testifying ([[https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%2015%3A26&version=ESV][John 15:26]]),
# - commissioning ([[https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts%2013%3A4&version=ESV][Acts 13:4]]),
# - issuing commands ([[https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts%208%3A29&version=ESV][Acts 8:29]]), and
# - interceding ([[https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%208%3A26&version=ESV][Rom. 8:26]]).

# The Holy Spirit is the third person of the Trinity ([[https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2028%3A19&version=ESV][Matt. 28:19]]).

# *** Salvation

# Jehovah's Witnesses believe that salvation requires faith in Christ, association with God's
# organization (i.e., their religion), and obedience to its rules.

# Biblically, however, viewing obedience to rules as a requirement for salvation nullifies the gospel
# ([[https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Galatians%202%3A16-21&version=ESV][Gal. 2:16-21]]; Col. 2:20-23). Salvation is based wholly on God's unmerited favor (grace), not on
# the believer's performance.

# Good works are the fruit or result, not the basis, of salvation ([[https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians%202%3A8-10&version=ESV][Eph. 2:8-10]]; Titus 3:4-8).

# *** Two redeemed peoples

# Jehovah's Witnesses believe there are two peoples of God: (1) the Anointed Class (144,000) will
# live in heaven and rule with Christ; and (2) the "other sheep" (all other believers) will live
# forever on a paradise earth.

# Biblically, however, a heavenly destiny awaits all who believe in Christ ([[https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%2014%3A1-3&version=ESV][John 14:1-3]]; 17:24; 2
# Cor. 5:1; [[https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Philippians%203%3A20&version=ESV][Phil. 3:20]]; Col. 1:5; 1 Thess. 4:17; Heb. 3:1), and these same people will also dwell on
# the new earth ([[https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Pet%203%3A13&version=ESV][2 Pet. 3:13]]; Rev. 21:1-4).

# *** No immaterial soul

# Jehovah's Witnesses do not believe that humans have an immaterial nature. The "soul" is simply the
# life-force within a person. At death, that life-force leaves the body.

# Biblically, however, the word "soul" is multifaceted. One key meaning of the term is man's
# immaterial self that consciously survives death ([[https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis%2035%3A18&version=ESV][Gen. 35:18]]; Rev. 6:9-10). Unbelievers are in
# conscious woe ([[https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2013%3A42&version=ESV][Matt. 13:42]]; 25:41, 46; Luke 16:22-24; Rev. 14:11) while believers are in conscious
# bliss in heaven ([[https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Corinthians%202%3A9&version=ESV][1 Cor. 2:9]]; 2 Cor. 5:6-8; Phil. 1:21-23; Rev. 7:17; 21:4).

# *** Hell

# Jehovah's Witnesses believe hell is not a place of eternal suffering but is rather the common grave
# of humankind. The wicked are annihilated-snuffed out of conscious existence forever.

# Biblically, however, hell is a real place of conscious, eternal suffering ([[https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%205%3A22&version=ESV][Matt. 5:22]]; 25:41, 46;
# Jude 7; Rev. 14:11; 20:10, 14).

who don't preach for us to 'do' the will of God, but merely want God to do it, when Jesus told His disciples to teach people to obey Him.

How does he now say, I have come down from heaven? Jesus answered them, Do not grumble among yourselves. No one can come to me unless the Father who sent me draws him. And I will raise him up on the last day. It is written in the Prophets, And they will all be taught by God. Everyone who has heard and learned from the Father comes to me— not that anyone has seen the Father except he who is from God; he has seen the Father. Truly, truly, I say to you, whoever believes has eternal life. (ESV)

For out of Zion shall go forth the law, and the word of the LORD from Jerusalem. He shall judge between many peoples, and shall decide for strong nations afar off; and they shall beat their swords into plowshares, and their spears into pruning hooks; nation shall not lift up sword against nation, neither shall they learn war anymore; but they shall sit every man under his vine and under his fig tree, and no one shall make them afraid, for the mouth of the LORD of hosts has spoken. For all the peoples walk each in the name of its god, but we will walk in the name of the LORD our God forever and ever. In that day, declares the LORD, I will assemble the lame and gather those who have been driven away and those whom I have afflicted; and the lame I will make the remnant, and those who were cast off, a strong nation; and the LORD will reign over them in Mount Zion from this time forth and forevermore. And you, O tower of the flock, hill of the daughter of Zion, to you shall it come, the former dominion shall come, kingship for the daughter of Jerusalem. Now why do you cry aloud? Is there no king in you? Has your counselor perished, that pain seized you like a woman in labor? Writhe and groan, O daughter of Zion, like a woman in labor, for now you shall go out from the city and dwell in the open country; you shall go to Babylon. There you shall be rescued; there the LORD will redeem you from the hand of your enemies. Now many nations are assembled against you, saying, Let her be defiled, and let our eyes gaze upon Zion. But they do not know the thoughts of the LORD; they do not understand his plan, that he has gathered them as sheaves to the threshing floor. Arise and thresh, O daughter of Zion, for I will make your horn iron, and I will make your hoofs bronze; you shall beat in pieces many peoples; and shall devote their gain to the LORD, their wealth to the Lord of the whole earth.

I speak as to sensible people; judge for yourselves what I say. The cup of blessing that we bless, is it not a participation in the blood of Christ? The bread that we break, is it not a participation in the body of Christ? Because there is one bread, we who are many are one body, for we all partake of the one bread. Consider the people of Israel: are not those who eat the sacrifices participants in the altar? What do I imply then? That food offered to idols is anything, or that an idol is anything? No, I imply that what pagans sacrifice they offer to demons and not to God. I do not want you to be participants with demons. *You cannot drink the cup of the Lord and the cup of demons. You cannot partake of the table of the Lord and the table of demons*. Shall we provoke the Lord to jealousy? Are we stronger than he? All things are lawful, but not all things are helpful. All things are lawful, but not all things build up. Let no one seek his own good, but the good of his neighbor. Eat whatever is sold in the meat market without raising any question on the ground of conscience. For the earth is the Lord's, and the fullness thereof. If one of the unbelievers invites you to dinner and you are disposed to go, eat whatever is set before you without raising any question on the ground of conscience. But if someone says to you, This has been offered in sacrifice, then do not eat it, for the sake of the one who informed you, and for the sake of conscience— I do not mean your conscience, but his. For why should my liberty be determined by someone else's conscience? If I partake with thankfulness, why am I denounced because of that for which I give thanks? So, whether you eat or drink, or whatever you do, do all to the glory of God.

+ Quote from John Piper :: The prosperity gospel is no gospel because what it does is offer to people what they want as natural people.

Amen to that.

The reason we want to be righteous is so we get God, not that we *become* God but that we abide in God.

Yes, we must be obedient as He is obedient, but that first act of obedience and the most important one is that we allow Jesus to wash us. We must believe, Jesus, trust in Jesus:

And being found in human form, he humbled himself by becoming obedient to the point of death, even death on a cross. Therefore God has highly exalted him and bestowed on him the name that is above every name, so that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, in heaven and on earth and under the earth, and every tongue confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.

We must accept this teaching:

  *[[https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%206%3A40-47&version=ESV][John 6:40-47]]* - For this is the will of my Father, that everyone who looks on the Son and believes in him should have eternal life, and I will raise him up on the last day. So the Jews grumbled about him, because he said, I am the bread that came down from heaven. They said, Is not this Jesus, the son of Joseph, whose father and mother we know? How does he now say, I have come down from heaven? Jesus answered them, Do not grumble among yourselves. No one can come to me unless the Father who sent me draws him. And I will raise him up on the last day. It is written in the Prophets, And they will all be taught by God. Everyone who has heard and learned from the Father comes to me— not that anyone has seen the Father except he who is from God; he has seen the Father. Truly, truly, I say to you, whoever believes has eternal life. (ESV)
