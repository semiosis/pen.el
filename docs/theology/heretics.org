So, yeah, a lot of modern-day Christianity is probably even more heretical than Valentinianism to be honest.

I think we must also recognise that the LORD is Jehovah-Jireh and He acts for those who wait for Him - who put their trust in Him:

The JW believe that the Lord Jesus Christ was assigned as a son
to God in Baptism, which was the beginning of his second birth.
The Lord Jesus Christ became a spiritual son to God in it, and a
king over the Kingdom of Jehovah. Actually, Baptism was one
of the occasions in which the Father witnessed to this Sonship
saying, “This is My beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased”

For out of Zion shall go forth the law, and the word of the LORD from Jerusalem.

Consider the people of Israel: are not those who eat the sacrifices participants in the altar? What do I imply then? That food offered to idols is anything, or that an idol is anything? No, I imply that what pagans sacrifice they offer to demons and not to God. I do not want you to be participants with demons. *You cannot drink the cup of the Lord and the cup of demons. You cannot partake of the table of the Lord and the table of demons*. Shall we provoke the Lord to jealousy? Are we stronger than he? All things are lawful, but not all things are helpful. All things are lawful, but not all things build up. Let no one seek his own good, but the good of his neighbor. Eat whatever is sold in the meat market without raising any question on the ground of conscience. For the earth is the Lord's, and the fullness thereof. If one of the unbelievers invites you to dinner and you are disposed to go, eat whatever is set before you without raising any question on the ground of conscience. But if someone says to you, This has been offered in sacrifice, then do not eat it, for the sake of the one who informed you, and for the sake of conscience— I do not mean your conscience, but his. For why should my liberty be determined by someone else's conscience? If I partake with thankfulness, why am I denounced because of that for which I give thanks?

+ Quote from John Piper :: The prosperity gospel is no gospel because what it does is offer to people what they want as natural people.

Amen to that.

The reason we want to be righteous is so we get God, not that we *become* God but that we abide in God.

Yes, we must be obedient as He is obedient, but that first act of obedience and the most important one is that we allow Jesus to wash us. We must believe, Jesus, trust in Jesus:

  *[[https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Philippians%202%3A5-11&version=ESV][Philippians 2:5-11]]* - Have this mind among yourselves, which is yours in Christ Jesus, who, though he was in the form of God, did not count equality with God a thing to be grasped, but made himself nothing, taking the form of a servant, being born in the likeness of men. And being found in human form, he humbled himself by becoming obedient to the point of death, even death on a cross. Therefore God has highly exalted him and bestowed on him the name that is above every name, so that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, in heaven and on earth and under the earth, and every tongue confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.

We must accept this teaching:

  *[[https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%206%3A40-47&version=ESV][John 6:40-47]]* - For this is the will of my Father, that everyone who looks on the Son and believes in him should have eternal life, and I will raise him up on the last day. So the Jews grumbled about him, because he said, I am the bread that came down from heaven. They said, Is not this Jesus, the son of Joseph, whose father and mother we know? How does he now say, I have come down from heaven? Jesus answered them, Do not grumble among yourselves. No one can come to me unless the Father who sent me draws him. And I will raise him up on the last day. It is written in the Prophets, And they will all be taught by God. Everyone who has heard and learned from the Father comes to me— not that anyone has seen the Father except he who is from God; he has seen the Father. Truly, truly, I say to you, whoever believes has eternal life. (ESV)
