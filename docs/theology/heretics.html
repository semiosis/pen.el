So, yeah, a lot of modern-day Christianity is probably even more heretical than Valentinianism to be honest.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-5-1">
<p>
We never proclaim ourself to be God. Never:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Thessalonians%202%3A1-4&amp;version=ESV">II Thessalonians 2:1-4</a></b> - Now concerning <b>the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ</b> and our being gathered together to him, we ask you, brothers, not to be quickly shaken in mind or alarmed, either by a spirit or a spoken word, or a letter seeming to be from us, to the effect that the day of the Lord has come. Let no one deceive you in any way. For that day will not come, unless the rebellion comes first, and the man of lawlessness is revealed, <b>the son of destruction, who opposes and exalts himself against every so-called god or object of worship</b>, so that he takes his seat in the temple of God, <b>proclaiming himself to be God.</b> (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
We must not take the name of the LORD in vain. This is something I'm concerned about with the JWs' Bible translation because they seem to be reinforcing/consolidating their Bible translation using the LORD's name and where it has errors this is saying, "thus saith the LORD" regarding their Bible translation:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Exodus%2020%3A7&amp;version=ESV">Exodus 20:7</a></b> - You shall not take the name of the LORD your God in vain, for the LORD will not hold him guiltless who takes his name in vain. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
But we must do our best to not misrepresent God:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Job%2042%3A7&amp;version=ESV">Job 42:7</a></b> - After the LORD had spoken these words to Job, the LORD said to Eliphaz the Temanite: My anger burns against you and against your two friends, for you have not spoken of me what is right, as my servant Job has. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
I think we must also recognise that the LORD is Jehovah-Jireh and He acts for those who wait for Him - who put their trust in Him:
</p>

<p>
What we should do now is acknowledge the LORD, keep our eyes on Jesus, and live godly lives (godliness is behaviour in accordance with the knowledge of God, believe the truth and walk in that truth, love the light, walk in the light, walk in the truth). Trust in the LORD to save us as we walk in the light (in obedience):
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Proverbs%203%3A5-6&amp;version=ESV">Proverbs 3:5-6</a></b> - <b>Trust</b> in the LORD with all your heart, and do not lean on your own understanding. In all your ways acknowledge him, and he will make straight your paths. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
At the end of the day it's not what we do for God but what God has done for us, and continues to do for us that matters most:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20John%204%3A10&amp;version=ESV">I John 4:10</a></b> - In this is love, not that we have loved God but that he loved us and sent his Son to be the propitiation for our sins. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
God acts for those who wait for Him:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah%2064%3A4&amp;version=ESV">Isaiah 64:4</a></b> - From of old no one has heard or perceived by the ear, no eye has seen a God besides you, <b>who acts</b> <span class="underline">for those who wait for him</span>. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
I have not read all of this, and I can't affirm what I have not read:

<ul class="org-ul">

</ul>

<p>
The JW believe that the Lord Jesus Christ was assigned as a son
to God in Baptism, which was the beginning of his second birth.
</p>

<p>
The Lord Jesus Christ became a spiritual son to God in it, and a
king over the Kingdom of Jehovah. Actually, Baptism was one
of the occasions in which the Father witnessed to this Sonship
saying, “This is My beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased”
(<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%203%3A17&amp;version=ESV">Matthew 3:17</a>):
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%203%3A17&amp;version=ESV">Matthew 3:17</a></b> - and behold, a voice from heaven said, This is my beloved Son, with whom I am well pleased. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<dl class="org-dl">

</dl>

<p>
John the Baptist also witnessed to this, saying,
“And I have seen and testified that this is the Son of God”
(<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%201%3A34&amp;version=ESV">John 1:34</a>):
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%201%3A34&amp;version=ESV">John 1:34</a></b> - And I have seen and have borne witness that this is the Son of God. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Corinthians%202%3A9&amp;version=ESV">I Corinthians 2:9</a></b> - But, as it is written, What no eye has seen, nor ear heard, nor the heart of man imagined, what God has prepared for those who love him— (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah%2064%3A4&amp;version=ESV">Isaiah 64:4</a></b> - From of old no one has heard or perceived by the ear, no eye has seen a God besides you, who acts for those who wait for him. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Ultimately, it's not about what we can do for God but for what God has done for us.
</p>

<p>
Also, I believe that Jesus was from the very beginning Jehovah's Son.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%201%3A1-2&amp;version=ESV">John 1:1-2</a></b> - In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. He was in the beginning with God. (ESV)
</p>

<p>
I think it's important to affirm that this is God's name to be remembered throughout all generations, however we are not supposed to <b>misuse</b> the LORD's name.

In NT times, Jesus referred to God as "Father" (Gk. Pater; <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%206%3A9&amp;version=ESV">Matt. 6:9</a>), as did the apostles (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Corinthians%201%3A3&amp;version=ESV">1 Cor. 1:3</a>).
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>

</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
I consider that the reason for this is simply in that we do not take the LORD's name in vain.
But we also want the LORD's name to be remembered.

This is a problem in Calvinist churches with people (especially pastors)
who don't preach for us to 'do' the will of God, but merely want God to do it, when Jesus told His disciples to teach people to obey Him.

<p>
The truth is we are set free from sin to become slaves of God and the fruit of being a slave to God leads to sanctification and at its end, eternal life:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%206%3A22-23&amp;version=ESV">Romans 6:22-23</a></b> - But now that you have been set free from sin and have become slaves of God, the fruit you get leads to sanctification and its end, eternal life. For the wages of sin is death, but the free gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
We must keep ourselves in the love of God by obeying Jesus Christ's commandments, because we're awaiting to receive eternal life:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Jude%201%3A21&amp;version=ESV">Jude 1:21</a></b> - <b>keep yourselves in the love of God,</b> waiting for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ that leads to eternal life. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Keeping Jesus Christ's commandments is a requirement to inherit eternal life:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%2015%3A10&amp;version=ESV">John 15:10</a></b> - <b>If you keep my commandments, you will abide in my love,</b> just as I have kept my Father's commandments and abide in his love. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Love for God and an obedient heart is required to be a child of God:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>God's children love Him, and love Jesus, and the ones who obey Jesus are the ones who love Him.</li>
<li>Faith believes Jesus, loves Jesus, and obeys Jesus</li>
</ul>

<p>
Faith:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Forward action in trusting Him
<ul class="org-ul">

</ul>

<p>
It's what God has done for us that matters most, not what we can do for Him.
In fact, we can't do anything if we abide outside of Christ.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%2015%3A4-5&amp;version=ESV">John 15:4-5</a></b> - Abide in me, and I in you. As the branch cannot bear fruit by itself, unless it abides in the vine, neither can you, unless you abide in me. I am the vine; you are the branches. Whoever abides in me and I in him, he it is that bears much fruit, for apart from me you can do nothing. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
We abide in Christ when He washes us, and this is not our action but Jesus' action to us:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%2015%3A3&amp;version=ESV">John 15:3</a></b> - Already you are clean because of the word that I have spoken to you. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%2013%3A8&amp;version=ESV">John 13:8</a></b> - Peter said to him, You shall never wash my feet. Jesus answered him, If I do not wash you, you have no share with me. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
We must remain in Christ:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%2015%3A4&amp;version=ESV">John 15:4</a></b> - Abide in me, and I in you. As the branch cannot bear fruit by itself, unless it abides in the vine, neither can you, unless you abide in me. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Jesus doesn't cast us out:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%206%3A37-39&amp;version=ESV">John 6:37-39</a></b> - All that the Father gives me will come to me, and whoever comes to me I will never cast out. For I have come down from heaven, not to do my own will but the will of him who sent me. And this is the will of him who sent me, that I should lose nothing of all that he has given me, but raise it up on the last day. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
We must accept this teaching:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%206%3A40-47&amp;version=ESV">John 6:40-47</a></b> - For this is the will of my Father, that everyone who looks on the Son and believes in him should have eternal life, and I will raise him up on the last day. So the Jews grumbled about him, because he said, I am the bread that came down from heaven. They said, Is not this Jesus, the son of Joseph, whose father and mother we know? How does he now say, I have come down from heaven? Jesus answered them, Do not grumble among yourselves. No one can come to me unless the Father who sent me draws him. And I will raise him up on the last day. It is written in the Prophets, And they will all be taught by God. Everyone who has heard and learned from the Father comes to me— not that anyone has seen the Father except he who is from God; he has seen the Father. Truly, truly, I say to you, whoever believes has eternal life. (ESV)

</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Therefore, I don't want to flat-out disqualify people who do not have precisely the correct doctrine or theology.
</p>

<p>
Jesus goes to those who hear His voice to bring them into His flock:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%2010%3A16&amp;version=ESV">John 10:16</a></b> - And I have other sheep that are not of this fold. I must bring them also, and they will listen to my voice. So there will be one flock, one shepherd. (ESV)

<p>
Jesus Christ is God's servant. We are Jesus' servants. It is a kingdom of servants, obedient to God.
</p>

<p>
Not all religions are equal. There is only one true God, the Father of Jesus Christ who has revealed Himself in Jesus Christ.
</p>

<p>
The only way is Jesus:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%2014%3A6&amp;version=ESV">John 14:6</a></b> - Jesus said to him, I am the way, and the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me. (ESV)

As we have said before, so now I say again: If anyone is preaching to you a gospel contrary to the one you received, let him be accursed. For am I now seeking the approval of man, or of God?

For out of Zion shall go forth the law, and the word of the LORD from Jerusalem. He shall judge between many peoples, and shall decide for strong nations afar off; and they shall beat their swords into plowshares, and their spears into pruning hooks; nation shall not lift up sword against nation, neither shall they learn war anymore; but they shall sit every man under his vine and under his fig tree, and no one shall make them afraid, for the mouth of the LORD of hosts has spoken. For all the peoples walk each in the name of its god, but we will walk in the name of the LORD our God forever and ever. In that day, declares the LORD, I will assemble the lame and gather those who have been driven away and those whom I have afflicted; and the lame I will make the remnant, and those who were cast off, a strong nation; and the LORD will reign over them in Mount Zion from this time forth and forevermore. And you, O tower of the flock, hill of the daughter of Zion, to you shall it come, the former dominion shall come, kingship for the daughter of Jerusalem. Now why do you cry aloud? Is there no king in you? Has your counselor perished, that pain seized you like a woman in labor? Writhe and groan, O daughter of Zion, like a woman in labor, for now you shall go out from the city and dwell in the open country; you shall go to Babylon. There you shall be rescued; there the LORD will redeem you from the hand of your enemies. Now many nations are assembled against you, saying, Let her be defiled, and let our eyes gaze upon Zion. But they do not know the thoughts of the LORD; they do not understand his plan, that he has gathered them as sheaves to the threshing floor. Arise and thresh, O daughter of Zion, for I will make your horn iron, and I will make your hoofs bronze; you shall beat in pieces many peoples; and shall devote their gain to the LORD, their wealth to the Lord of the whole earth.

The bread that we break, is it not a participation in the body of Christ? Because there is one bread, we who are many are one body, for we all partake of the one bread. Consider the people of Israel: are not those who eat the sacrifices participants in the altar? What do I imply then? That food offered to idols is anything, or that an idol is anything? No, I imply that what pagans sacrifice they offer to demons and not to God. I do not want you to be participants with demons. <b>You cannot drink the cup of the Lord and the cup of demons.

Eat whatever is sold in the meat market without raising any question on the ground of conscience. For the earth is the Lord's, and the fullness thereof. If one of the unbelievers invites you to dinner and you are disposed to go, eat whatever is set before you without raising any question on the ground of conscience. But if someone says to you, This has been offered in sacrifice, then do not eat it, for the sake of the one who informed you, and for the sake of conscience— I do not mean your conscience, but his. For why should my liberty be determined by someone else's conscience? If I partake with thankfulness, why am I denounced because of that for which I give thanks? So, whether you eat or drink, or whatever you do, do all to the glory of God.

Amen to that.

The reason we want to be righteous is so we get God, not that we <b>become</b> God but that we abide in God.

Yes, we must be obedient as He is obedient, but that first act of obedience and the most important one is that we allow Jesus to wash us. We must believe, Jesus, trust in Jesus:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Philippians%202%3A5-11&amp;version=ESV">Philippians 2:5-11</a></b> - Have this mind among yourselves, which is yours in Christ Jesus, who, though he was in the form of God, did not count equality with God a thing to be grasped, but made himself nothing, taking the form of a servant, being born in the likeness of men. And being found in human form, he humbled himself by becoming obedient to the point of death, even death on a cross. Therefore God has highly exalted him and bestowed on him the name that is above every name, so that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, in heaven and on earth and under the earth, and every tongue confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father. (ESV)

<p>
We must accept this teaching:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%206%3A40-47&amp;version=ESV">John 6:40-47</a></b> - For this is the will of my Father, that everyone who looks on the Son and believes in him should have eternal life, and I will raise him up on the last day. So the Jews grumbled about him, because he said, I am the bread that came down from heaven. They said, Is not this Jesus, the son of Joseph, whose father and mother we know? How does he now say, I have come down from heaven? Jesus answered them, Do not grumble among yourselves. No one can come to me unless the Father who sent me draws him. And I will raise him up on the last day. It is written in the Prophets, And they will all be taught by God. Everyone who has heard and learned from the Father comes to me— not that anyone has seen the Father except he who is from God; he has seen the Father. Truly, truly, I say to you, whoever believes has eternal life. (ESV)
