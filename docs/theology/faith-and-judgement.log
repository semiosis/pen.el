[] \TU/lmtt/m/n/10.95 2  This is a sobering verse, especially for believers who
 regularly participate in communion. Paul has already warned Christians to exam
ine themselves before taking part in the Lord's Supper to avoid doing so in an 
unworthy way (1 Corinthians 11:28).[]

[] \TU/lmtt/m/n/10.95 6  The first question this raises is the precise meaning 
of "discerning the body." Bible scholars primarily suggest two ways of interpre
ting this, both of which are reasonable, and which can even both be true.[]

Overfull \hbox (3033.69673pt too wide) in paragraph at lines 27479--27479
[] \TU/lmtt/m/n/10.95 8  The first suggestion is that this refers to a recognit
ion: that the symbolic parallel to Christ's body in the elements of the bread a
nd cup causes a Christian to see them as different from other food. In other wo
rds, the Lord's Supper should not be treated like just another meal used to sat
isfy physical hunger. It must be approached with respect as something much more
 meaningful and important. This first view of "discerning the body" would fit w
ith Paul's instructions in the following verses about not coming hungry to the 
Lord's Supper gathering. The Corinthians were clearly not doing this (1 Corinth
ians 11:17–

g" the death of Jesus (1 Corinthians 11:26). If a person proclaims Jesus' death
, but is disobedient to the gospel, that person is essentially daring God to ju
dge them (Galatians 6:6–

ody" means recognizing the relationship between Christ's body and the "body of 
Christ," known as the church. In other words, we must see Christ in our fellow 
Christians and treat them as we would treat Jesus when we come together. This v
iew fits with what Paul wrote in 1 Corinthians 10:16–
