<b>Acts 13:48</b> - And when the Gentiles heard this, they began rejoicing and glorifying the word of the Lord, and as many as were appointed to eternal life believed. (ESV)
</p>

<p>
I've been thinking about belief, faith, works, law and receiving the Holy Spirit!
Please let me know what you think if you have the time.
</p>

<p>
I'm trying to get clearer on this.
Please feel free to discuss it with me.
</p>

<p>
<b>Romans 10:3-4</b> - For, being ignorant of the righteousness that comes from God, and seeking to establish their own, they did not submit to God's righteousness. For Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to everyone who believes.
</p>

<p>
I enjoyed this video, but I still am of the opinion that keeping the law is not necessary, (but not prohibited, so long as it is pursued by faith and submitting to God's righteousness):
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNHKqhwu6Bo">Public Debate - Should Christians Keep The Law? - YouTube</a></li>
</ul>

<p>
What I like about the didache is that it still upholds righteous living and following God's Great commandments and precepts.
</p>

<p>
<a href="https://www.earlychristianwritings.com/text/didache-roberts.html">https://www.earlychristianwritings.com/text/didache-roberts.html</a>
</p>

<p>
I think it's important to live righteously out of love for God and one's neighbour, and out of faith.
That being said, I think God does justify through faith, and I believe faith works. And working may indeed be called faith if the work is done in faith.
I also think God likely saves through works because it may be their way of demonstrating faith to Jesus.
</p>

<p>
There's a false dichotomy between faith and works.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-org1ba3b9e" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org1ba3b9e"><span class="section-number-2">2.</span> Justifying faith vs justifying works is misunderstood and is a false dichotomy</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2">
<p>
Because someone has bundled 'trusting
action/seeking God in action' along with
'obedience' into works when it belongs inside
faith.
</p>

<p>
<b>Romans 4:2</b> - For if Abraham was justified by works, he has something to boast about, but not before God.
</p>

<p>
Paul doesn't deny that Abraham could have been
justified by works, but he claims that Abraham
doesn't have anything to boast about before
God. AMEN!!
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Obedience belongs inside faith because
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>God commanded it and complying is not really bringing anything
to God which He hasn't told you to bring to Him.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>So it's just acting in faith</li>
<li>If God commands you to wait a week before going into battle, is that considered work? No, it's faith.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Choosing to obey God's commandments even when no-one is watching (aside from God) is having faith in God.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Therefore, there is a way of abiding by God's commandments which is faith and not works.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Seeking God in action belongs in faith because
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>When someone wills to seek God, they act.</li>
<li>And <b>Hebrews 11:6</b> declares that faith is implied when someone believes God exists and rewards those who seek Him.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>And <b>Hebrews 11:6</b> declares that God rewards those who seek Him.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>
'Rewards from God for seeking Him' belongs in faith, or it's not faith anymore, even in regards to justifying faith.
</p>

<p>
<b>Hebrews 11:6</b> - And without faith it is impossible to please him, for whoever would draw near to God must believe that he exists and that he rewards those who seek him.
</p>

<p>
<b>Hebrews 11:24-26</b> - By faith Moses, when he was grown up, refused to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter, choosing rather to be mistreated with the people of God than to enjoy the fleeting pleasures of sin. He considered the reproach of Christ greater wealth than the treasures of Egypt, for he was looking to the reward.

<b>John 15:5</b> - I am the vine; you are the branches. Whoever abides in me and I in him, he it is that bears much fruit, for apart from me you can do nothing. (ESV)
</p>

<p>
Obedience is good.
</p>

<p>
<b>Psalms 40:6-8</b> - Sacrifice and offering you have not desired, but you have given me an open ear. Burnt offering and sin offering you have not required. Then I said, Behold, I have come; in the scroll of the book it is written of me: I desire to do your will, O my God; your law is within my heart. (ESV)
</p>

<p>
'Working' for God is OK when it's done in faith.
Obedience is intrinsic to faith.

<b>Hebrews 11:31</b> - By faith Rahab the prostitute did not perish with those who were disobedient, because she had given a friendly welcome to the spies.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-2">
<p>
What is wrong is trying to establish a righteousness of one's own apart from submitting to the righteousness of God - it's saying, "God, I think you should have this, or, God I think I'm righteous because I did this for you." rather than, "here is what you asked of me, LORD."
</p>

<p>
Work not done in faith:
</p>

<p>
<b>Leviticus 10:1-2</b> - Now Nadab and Abihu, the sons of Aaron, each took his censer and put fire in it and laid incense on it and offered unauthorized fire before the Lord, which he had not commanded them. And fire came out from before the Lord and consumed them, and they died before the Lord.
</p>

<p>
God didn't ask for the offering which Nadab and Abihu offered.
</p>

<p>
Ananias gave to God unfaithfully, in a manner similar to Cain.
</p>

<p>
<b>Acts 4:32</b> - Now the full number of those who believed were of one heart and soul, and no one said that any of the things that belonged to him was his own, but they had everything in common.
</p>

<p>
<b>Acts 5:1-5</b> -  But a man named Ananias, with his wife Sapphira, sold a piece of property, and with his wife's knowledge he kept back for himself some of the proceeds and brought only a part of it and laid it at the apostles' feet.  But Peter said, Ananias, why has Satan filled your heart to lie to the Holy Spirit and to keep back for yourself part of the proceeds of the land?  While it remained unsold, did it not remain your own?  And after it was sold, was it not at your disposal?  Why is it that you have contrived this deed in your heart?  You have not lied to men but to God.  When Ananias heard these words, he fell down and breathed his last.  And great fear came upon all who heard of it.  (ESV)
</p>

<p>
Cain was half-hearted with his offering to the LORD, as Ananias was:
</p>

<p>
<b>Genesis 4:3-5</b> - In the course of time Cain brought to the Lord an offering of the fruit of the ground, and Abel also brought of the firstborn of his flock and of their fat portions. And the Lord had regard for Abel and his offering, but for Cain and his offering he had no regard. So Cain was very angry, and his face fell. (ESV)
</p>

<p>
<b>1 John 3:12</b> - We should not be like Cain, who was of the evil one and murdered his brother. And why did he murder him? Because his own deeds were evil and his brother's righteous. (ESV)
</p>

<p>
<b>Hebrews 6:1</b> - Therefore let us leave the elementary doctrine of Christ and go on to maturity, not laying again a foundation of repentance from dead works and of faith toward God,
</p>

<p>
Dead works are works not done in service to God, but works done in service to God, He may accept.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org9b4edb6" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org9b4edb6"><span class="section-number-3">2.3.</span> Acceptable works - works done in faith</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-3">
<p>
<b>James 2:18</b> - But someone will say, You have faith and I have works. Show me your faith apart from your works, and I will show you my faith by my works.
</p>

<p>
<b>Hebrews 9:14</b> - how much more will the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself without blemish to God, purify our conscience from dead works to serve the living God.
</p>

<p>
We stop doing dead works to serve the living God, which I believe is obedience,
which is really similar to work but it's obeying. Obedience gives glory to God.
</p>

<p>
<b>John 13:34-35</b> - A new commandment I give to you, that you love one another: just as I have loved you, you also are to love one another. By this all people will know that you are my disciples, if you have love for one another. (ESV)
</p>

<p>
Obeying Jesus' commandments are not 'dead works'.
</p>

<p>
<b>Exodus 20:12-17</b> - Honor your father and your mother, that your days may be long in the land that the Lord your God is giving you. You shall not murder. You shall not commit adultery. You shall not steal. You shall not bear false witness against your neighbor. You shall not covet your neighbor's house; you shall not covet your neighbor's wife, or his male servant, or his female servant, or his ox, or his donkey, or anything that is your neighbor's.
</p>

<p>
Jesus said:
</p>

<p>
<b>Mark 10:19</b> - You know the commandments: Do not murder, Do not commit adultery, Do not steal, Do not bear false witness, Do not defraud, Honor your father and mother. (ESV)
</p>

<p>
Obeying God by following the 10 commandments properly, in truth, is not performing 'dead works'.
</p>

<p>
<b>Hebrews 9:14</b> - how much more will the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself without blemish to God, purify our conscience from dead works to serve the living God.
</p>

<p>
Service to God is obeying God through Christ's commandments. It's being a bond-servant of Christ.
</p>

<p>
Also, the following means that having faith in Jesus is tightly coupled to doing the works that Jesus did - to acting like Jesus - to obeying His commandments.
</p>

<p>
<b>John 14:12</b> - Truly, truly, I say to you, whoever believes in me will also do the works that I do; and <b>greater works than these will he do</b>, because I am going to the Father.
</p>

<p>
Whoever has faith in Jesus, the works that Jesus does, that person will do.
Pisteuo = faith.
</p>

<p>
<b>John 14:12</b> - Truly (G281 amen), truly (G281 amen), I say (G3004 lego) to you, he who believes (G4100 pisteuo) in Me, the works (G2041 ergon) that I do (G4160 poieo), he will do (G4160 poieo) also (G2548 kakeinos); and greater (G3173 megas) works than these (G3778 houtos) he will do (G4160 poieo); because (G3754 hoti) I go (G4198 poreuomai) to the Father (G3962 pater).

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-2-3-1">
<p>
<b>Acts 10:2</b> - a devout man and one who feared God with all his household, and gave many alms to the Jewish people and prayed to God continually.  About the ninth hour of the day he clearly saw in a vision an angel of God who had just come in and said to him, “Cornelius!” And fixing his gaze on him and being much alarmed, he said, “What is it, Lord?” And he said to him, “Your prayers and alms have ascended as a memorial before God.

<div id="outline-container-orge2e385f" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="orge2e385f"><span class="section-number-4">2.3.2.</span> Faith has an amount.</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-2-3-2">
<p>
I think even saving faith requires an amount.
Shear fear of God or love for Him is work which comes out of belief.
But faith works, even saving faith works.
Faith without work doesn't exist I think because the work of God is to believe on who He has sent - Jesus - but the 'Work/Love' can come from Jesus, I think.
For example, with Lazarus - Jesus performed the miracle so the people watching could believe and have faith.
Jesus wept before he raise Lazarus from the dead, and many other people believed in Jesus and were saved, I assume.
</p>

<p>
<b>I Corinthians 13:13</b> - So now faith, hope, and love abide, these three; but the greatest of these is love.
</p>

<p>
<b>John 11:35</b> - Jesus wept.
</p>

<p>
<b>John 11:41-42</b> - So they took away the stone. And Jesus lifted up his eyes and said, Father, I thank you that you have heard me. I knew that you always hear me, but I said this on account of the people standing around, that they may believe that you sent me.
</p>

<p>
And Jesus is able to save a person out of Jesus' own will, as he resurrected Lazarus.
</p>

<p>
<b>John 11:43</b> - When He had said these things, He cried out with a loud voice, “Lazarus, come forth.”
</p>

<p>
But faith is like Peter stepping out on the water. Faith works. But I think sometimes to create faith someone just has to actually believe Jesus because Jesus performs the miracle / the work. The account of Jesus itself when it's read, and Jesus' words, are enough to inspire faith. Jesus calls persistent endurance a work. Therefore, faith comes by hearing the word of Christ.
</p>

<p>
<b>Ephesians 2:8-9</b> - For by grace you have been saved through faith. And this is not your own doing; it is the gift of God, not a result of works, so that no one may boast.
</p>

<p>
I think <b>Ephesians 2:8-9</b> when it says 'through faith' doesn't actually exclude obedience (obeying Jesus), because I think obedience is intrinsic to faith.
</p>

<p>
When it says "not a result of works", I believe that something more like, even if works were tied into the faith, it's by grace. If a person's saving faith included works then that is fine.
</p>

<p>
Faith-in-God is hearing God's word and believing it, and even acting on it, or at least the readiness to act on it.
A person may act on faith in their heart by arriving at a conviction to the point where a person makes it truth for them.
Then, like Peter stepping out on the water, or like the woman at the well going in to town to tell people about Jesus, or turning from sinful things, it produces obedience.
And there is an amount of faith, and true belief is all that's required to be saved, but Faith is so tightly linked to Obedience like Faith is linked to Hope. True belief is enough because it accepts what Jesus says, as a child believes. But I don't think this discounts faith that increases through obedience.
</p>

<p>
Peter demonstrated obedience. A changed heart is essential to be saved, I think.

<p>
Hebrews describes faith as hope with belief in reward from seeking God.
</p>

<p>
<b>Hebrews 11:1</b> - Now faith is the assurance of things hoped for, the conviction of things not seen.
</p>

<p>
<b>Hebrews 11:6</b> - And without faith it is impossible to please him, for whoever would draw near to God must believe that he exists and that he rewards those who seek him.
</p>

<p>
The whole chapter of Hebrews 11 also describes many 'acts' of faith. Belief and action are like a vector.

Fear-of-God:

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><b>Romans 4:5</b> - And to the one who does not work but trusts him who justifies the ungodly, his faith is counted as righteousness,</li>
</ul>

<p>
AMEN!! But this doesn't mean the other elements of working faith can't play a part.
</p>

<p>
Faith has 'substance/magnitude' and may be described as a vector:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The origin of hope/belief is represented by the point.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>On the Faith plane, positive magnitude comes from trust in God</li>

<li>Hope-from/in-God is the direction.</li>
<li>Work/Love is the magnitude.</li>

<p>
Faith in the wrong thing:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>On the Faithless plane, positive magnitude comes from trust in something else, i.e. money or self</li>
</ul>

<p>
<b>I Corinthians 13:1</b> - If I speak in the tongues of men and of angels, but have not love, I am a noisy gong or a clanging cymbal.
</p>

<p>
<b>Romans 14:23</b> - But whoever has doubts is condemned if he eats, because the eating is not from faith. For whatever does not proceed from faith is sin.
</p>

<p>
<b>John 6:29</b> - Jesus answered them, This is the work of God, that you believe in him whom he has sent. (ESV)
</p>

<p>
There is a relation here:
</p>

<p>
<b>I Corinthians 13:7</b> - Love bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things.
</p>

<p>
<b>I Corinthians 13:13</b> - So now faith, hope, and love abide, these three; but the greatest of these is love.

<p>
But it's God that tests the faith, and God that justifies. That's why I don't like making an assertion on the exact way that God justifies, because God is the justifier.
</p>

<p>
<b>Romans 8:33</b> -  Who shall bring any charge against God's elect?  It is God who justifies.  (ESV)
</p>

<p>
The outcome is eternal life.
</p>

<p>
<b>Romans 6:22-23</b> - But now that you have been set free from sin and have become slaves to God, the fruit you reap leads to holiness, and the outcome is eternal life. For the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord. (BSB)
</p>

<p>
A person must <b>do</b> the will of Father God; They must be obedient.
Faith and obedience are inseparable.
</p>

<p>
<b>Matthew 7:21-23</b> - Not everyone who says to me, Lord, Lord, will enter the kingdom of heaven, but the one who does the will of my Father who is in heaven. On that day many will say to me, Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in your name, and cast out demons in your name, and do many mighty works in your name? And then will I declare to them, I never knew you; depart from me, you workers of lawlessness. (ESV)
</p>

<p>
<b>John 11:41-42</b> - So they took away the stone. And Jesus lifted up his eyes and said, Father, I thank you that you have heard me. I knew that you always hear me, but I said this on account of the people standing around, that they may believe that you sent me.
</p>

<p>
The works have to be the will of Father God. Initially this is believing in Him whom He has sent - believing in Jesus.
</p>

<p>
<b>John 6:29</b> - Jesus answered them, This is the work of God, that you <b>believe in him whom he has sent</b>. (ESV)
</p>

<p>
Being a servant of Christ from the heart is doing the will of God.
</p>

<p>
<b>Ephesians 6:6</b> - not by the way of eye-service, as people-pleasers, but as <b>servants of Christ</b>, doing the will of God from the heart,
</p>

<p>
Repenting from sin is doing the will of God.
</p>

<p>
<b>I Thessalonians 4:3</b> - For this is the will of God, your sanctification: that you abstain from sexual immorality;
</p>

<p>
Doing good is doing the will of God.
</p>

<p>
<b>I Peter 2:15</b> - For this is the will of God, that by doing good you should put to silence the ignorance of foolish people.
</p>

<p>
Doing the will of God, a person will have eternal life.
</p>

<b>I John 2:17</b> - And the world is passing away along with its desires, but whoever does the will of God abides forever. (ESV)

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-4">
<p>
<b>II Corinthians 10:5-6</b> - We destroy arguments and every lofty opinion raised against the knowledge of God, and take every thought captive to obey Christ, being ready to punish every disobedience, when your obedience is complete.
</p>

<p>
<b>Ephesians 2:2</b> - in which you once walked, following the course of this world, following the prince of the power of the air, the spirit that is now at work in the sons of disobedience—
</p>

<p>
<b>Ephesians 5:6</b> - Let no one deceive you with empty words, for because of these things the wrath of God comes upon the sons of disobedience.
</p>

<p>
Now obeying God is more than just believing, it's obeying (which is proportional to the magnitude of the faith).
</p>

<p>
Understand that the ones who remained in the boat and did not step out onto the water did not have enough faith to walk on water.
</p>

<p>
<b>Matthew 14:27-32</b> - But immediately Jesus spoke to them, saying, Take heart; it is I. Do not be afraid. And Peter answered him, Lord, if it is you, <b>command</b> me to come to you on the water. He said, Come. So Peter <b>got out of the boat and walked on the water and came to Jesus</b>. But when he saw the wind, he was afraid, and beginning to sink he cried out, Lord, save me. Jesus immediately reached out his hand and took hold of him, saying to him, O you of little faith, why did you doubt? And when they got into the boat, the wind ceased.
</p>

<p>
Fear made them disobedient. They had only a small amount of faith.
</p>

<p>
<b>Hebrews 2:2</b> - For since the message declared by angels proved to be reliable and every transgression or disobedience received a just retribution,
</p>

<p>
<b>Hebrews 9:14</b> - how much more will the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself without blemish to God, purify our conscience from dead works to serve the living God.

<p>
I think it's important to take in all the words which Jesus spoke which are available to us, and to come to a faith which is able to reconcile faith with works, and law and obedience, and the gospel Jesus taught before and after the resurrection, and reconcile the teachings of the epistles from Peter, Paul and John, and Epistle to the Hebrews.
</p>

<p>
<b>Matthew 13:15</b> - For the heart of this people has become dull, With their ears they scarcely hear, And they have closed their eyes, Otherwise they would see with their eyes, Hear with their ears, And understand with their heart and <b>return</b>, And I would heal them.’

<h2 id="org4080fe3"><span class="section-number-2">4.</span> Commandments and faith</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-4">
<p>
<b>Revelation of John 14:12</b> - Here is a call for the endurance of the saints, those who keep the commandments of God and their faith in Jesus.
</p>

<p>
I read this as 'A saint is someone who has faith in Jesus AND keeps the commandments (pursuing by faith, not works)'.
I read this as the Great commandments, 10 Commandments and faith in Jesus Christ, and potentially various other commandments from the Mosaic law if you now about them, or whatever subset a person practices.
But the law should be pursued by faith and not by works.
</p>

<p>
<b>John 15:10</b> - If you keep my commandments, you will abide in my love, just as I have kept my Father's commandments and abide in his love.
</p>

<p>
<b>Romans 9:30-32</b> - What shall we say, then? That Gentiles who did not pursue righteousness have attained it, that is, a righteousness that is by faith; but that Israel who pursued a law that would lead to righteousness did not succeed in reaching that law. Why? Because they did not pursue it by faith, but as if it were based on works. They have stumbled over the stumbling stone, (ESV)
</p>

<p>
Jesus' commandments don't contradict the rest of the commandments.
</p>

<p>
Also God's commandments (especially the 10 Commandments; loving God and your neighbour) are still binding on us - written on our heart when we get born-again and after being born-again we follow them in Spirit.
</p>

<p>
Jesus fulfilled the law =&gt; We have the Spirit of Christ =&gt; We are led by the Spirit and naturally want to follow the law in faith but the world opposes us because when a person actually follows the commandments, they do not lie, do not commit adultery, do not commit idolatry, etc. and that means a person can be 'taken advantage of' by unfaithful people who do not obey God's commandments but exploit others who follow God.
But we don't pursue the law by works. We are freed from being under the law, and free from the curse of the law to serve and obey God in truth, being under God's grace.
</p>

<p>
<b>Romans 7:6</b> - But now we are released from the law, having died to that which held us captive, so that we serve not under the old written code but in the new life of the Spirit. (ESV)
</p>

<p>
This is still following the law but in faith and in Spirit, not being under the law.
</p>

<p>
<b>Deuteronomy 4:13</b> - And he declared to you his covenant, which he commanded you to perform, that is, the Ten Commandments, and he wrote them on two tablets of stone.
</p>

<p>
<b>Romans 10:5</b> - For Moses writes about the righteousness that is based on the law, that the person who does the commandments shall live by them.
</p>

<p>
<b>Romans 13:9</b> - The commandments, You shall not commit adultery, You shall not murder, You shall not steal, You shall not covet, and any other commandment, are summed up in this word: You shall love your neighbor as yourself.
</p>

<p>
There's no contradiction.
</p>

<p>
However, we must submit to God's righteousness through faith in Jesus Christ.
</p>

<p>
The Mosaic law is not abolished but Jesus fulfilled it like a prophesy.
</p>

<p>
The righteousness we have through faith in Jesus Christ is needed whether someone keeps the Mosaic law or not.
Not that I keep the Mosaic law in its entirety, nor are circumcised. But I try to keep the Great commandments
and the 10 Commandments out of faith (and a relationship with God) and follow parts of the Mosaic law,
but I have faith in Jesus Christ for the righteousness that comes through faith because I need that because my own
righteousness will never be enough without faith in Jesus for God's righteousness imputed to me.
</p>

<p>
Thank You God.
</p>

<p>

This is why we are not <b>under</b> the law because we have the righteousness that comes through faith in Christ.

I think someone who trusts in God to save them through saving faith in Jesus Christ, is saved, or is in the process of being saved.

God is the judge of what saving faith looks like, and how long the process of 'being saved' takes.

She said to him, Yes, Lord; I believe that you are the Christ, the Son of God, who is coming into the world.
</p>

<p>
The person has to <b>really</b> believe - to have actual faith - the faith that continues to produce obedient work, the faith that continues to produce love.
</p>

<p>
Even Martha's faith here was put on display when she confessed,
"Yes, Lord; I believe that you are the Christ, the Son of God, who is coming into the world."
It shows she has faith.

<p>
<b>True</b> belief is enough to be spared from death.
However, I still think that inheriting the Kingdom involves obedience.
</p>

<p>
Also, here is saving faith for the one without work:
</p>

<p>
<b>Romans 4:5</b> - And to the one who does not work but trusts him who justifies the ungodly, his faith is counted as righteousness,
</p>

<p>
This qualifies:
</p>

<p>
<b>Luke 18:13</b> - But the tax collector, standing far off, would not even lift up his eyes to heaven, but beat his breast, saying, God, be merciful to me, a sinner! (ESV)

I believe there's a difference between being spared from condemnation and receiving eternal life.
</p>

<p>
<b>Romans 6:22</b> - But now that you have been set free from sin and have become slaves of God, the fruit you get leads to sanctification and its end, eternal life.
</p>

<p>
Eternal life is totally different - it's becoming a part of the Truth - it's union with Christ and with God.

Jesus said that patient endurance is a work.
</p>

<p>
Likewise, love for Jesus also qualifies as a work.
</p>

<p>
<b>Mark 11:23</b> - Truly, I say to you, whoever <b>says to this mountain, Be taken up and thrown into the sea</b>, and <b>does not doubt in his heart</b>, but believes that what he says <b>will come to pass</b>, it will be done for him.
</p>

<p>
Saving faith with work (yes, obedience is intrinsic to faith, like belief):
</p>

<p>
<b>Matthew 14:28-31</b> - And Peter answered him, Lord, if it is you, command me to come to you on the water. He said, Come. So Peter got out of the boat and walked on the water and came to Jesus. But when he saw the wind, he was afraid, and beginning to sink he cried out, Lord, save me. Jesus immediately reached out his hand and took hold of him, saying to him, O you of little faith, why did you doubt?
</p>

<p>
Obeying Jesus' commandments - believing Jesus and acting on Jesus' commandments <b>is</b> faith.

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-5-1-5">
<p>
James isn't talking about work of the law, he's talking about the works of faith.
</p>

<p>
<b>James 2:13-17</b> - For judgment is without mercy to one who has shown no mercy. Mercy triumphs over judgment. What good is it, my brothers, if someone says he has faith but does not have works? Can that faith save him? If a brother or sister is poorly clothed and lacking in daily food, and one of you says to them, Go in peace, be warmed and filled, without giving them the things needed for the body, what good is that? So also faith by itself, if it does not have works, is dead.
</p>

<p>
Faith without work is dead; it's useless.
</p>

<p>
That person is completely at the mercy of Jesus and of the saints, I think.
</p>

<p>
Sometimes a person's work is all burned up but they are <b>still saved</b>.
</p>

<p>
<b>1 Corinthians 3:15</b> - If anyone's work is burned up, he will suffer loss, though he himself will be saved, but only as through fire. (ESV)
</p>

<p>
I think then someone must be prepared to accept salvation through grace alone because they need it.

<p>
But salvation is a gift and God is sovereign to save.
That's why it's grace.
Saved by grace through faith.
</p>

<p>
I think a person needs <b>some</b> faith to be saved.
</p>

<p>
<b>Ephesians 2:8</b> - For by grace you have been saved through faith. And this is not your own doing; it is the gift of God, (ESV)
</p>

<p>
Mercy is available:
</p>

<p>
<b>Luke 18:13</b> - But the tax collector, standing far off, would not even lift up his eyes to heaven, but beat his breast, saying, God, be merciful to me, a sinner! (ESV)
</p>

<p>
Those who fear God inherit the Kingdom.

<b>Isaiah 66:2</b> - All these things my hand has made, and so all these things came to be, declares the LORD. But this is the one to whom I will look: he who is humble and contrite in spirit and trembles at my word. (ESV)
</p>

<p>
We need faithfulness and not faithlessness and disbelief to inherit the promises:
</p>

<p>
<b>Hebrews 12:16-17</b> - that no one is sexually immoral or unholy like Esau, who sold his birthright for a single meal. For you know that afterward, when he desired to inherit the blessing, he was rejected, for he found no chance to repent, though he sought it with tears.
</p>

<p>
<b>Revelation of John 2:2</b> - I know your works, your toil and your patient endurance, and how you cannot bear with those who are evil, but have tested those who call themselves apostles and are not, and found them to be false.
</p>

<p>
Here it says that unless the church <b>does the work</b> which it had started out doing, their lampstand will be removed from its place.
</p>

<p>
<b>Revelation of John 2:5</b> - Remember therefore from where you have fallen; repent, and do the works you did at first. If not, I will come to you and remove your lampstand from its place, unless you repent.
</p>

<p>
A response of love for Jesus <b>is</b> justifying work.
</p>

<p>
<b>Luke 7:47-50</b> - Therefore I tell you, her sins, which are many, are forgiven-for she loved much. But he who is forgiven little, loves little. And he said to her, Your sins are forgiven. Then those who were at table with him began to say among themselves, Who is this, who even forgives sins? And he said to the woman, Your faith has saved you; go in peace. (ESV)
</p>

<p>
<b>James 2:22-25</b> - You see that faith was active along with his works, and faith was completed by his works; and the Scripture was fulfilled that says, Abraham believed God, and it was counted to him as righteousness-and he was called a friend of God. You see that a person is justified by works and not by faith alone. And in the same way was not also Rahab the prostitute justified by works when she received the messengers and sent them out by another way?
</p>

<p>
ONLY <b>working faith</b> counts for anything. Even Paul agrees. However, it says 'in Christ Jesus', and I believe that those who trust in Jesus without work still abide, but by the skin of their teeth.
</p>

<p>
<b>Galatians 5:6</b> - For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision nor uncircumcision counts for anything, but <b>only faith working through love</b>. (ESV)
</p>

<p>
Loving God is obeying His commandments.
</p>

<p>
<b>I John 5:2-3</b> - By this we know that we love the children of God, when we love God and obey his commandments. For this is the love of God, that we keep his commandments. And his commandments are not burdensome.

The young man said to him, All these I have kept. What do I still lack? Jesus said to him, If you would be perfect, go, sell what you possess and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; and come, follow me. When the young man heard this he went away sorrowful, for he had great possessions. And Jesus said to his disciples, Truly, I say to you, only with difficulty will a rich person enter the kingdom of heaven. Again I tell you, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich person to enter the kingdom of God. When the disciples heard this, they were greatly astonished, saying, Who then can be saved? But Jesus looked at them and said, With man this is impossible, but with God all things are possible.

The guy thought he was obeying the commandments, but he still coveted his possessions, probably making an idol out of his money.

So the honor is for you who believe, but for those who do not believe, The stone that the builders rejected has become the cornerstone, and A stone of stumbling, and a rock of offense. They stumble because they disobey the word, as they were destined to do. But you are a chosen race, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people for his own possession, that you may proclaim the excellencies of him who called you out of darkness into his marvelous light. Once you were not a people, but now you are God's people; once you had not received mercy, but now you have received mercy. Beloved, I urge you as sojourners and exiles to abstain from the passions of the flesh, which wage war against your soul. Keep your conduct among the Gentiles honorable, so that when they speak against you as evildoers, they may see your good deeds and glorify God on the day of visitation. Be subject for the Lord's sake to every human institution, whether it be to the emperor as supreme, or to governors as sent by him to punish those who do evil and to praise those who do good. For this is the will of God, that by doing good you should put to silence the ignorance of foolish people. Live as people who are free, not using your freedom as a cover-up for evil, but living as servants of God. Honor everyone. Love the brotherhood. Fear God. Honor the emperor. Servants, be subject to your masters with all respect, not only to the good and gentle but also to the unjust. For this is a gracious thing, when, mindful of God, one endures sorrows while suffering unjustly. For what credit is it if, when you sin and are beaten for it, you endure? But if when you do good and suffer for it you endure, this is a gracious thing in the sight of God. For to this you have been called, because Christ also suffered for you, leaving you an example, so that you might follow in his steps. He committed no sin, neither was deceit found in his mouth. When he was reviled, he did not revile in return; when he suffered, he did not threaten, but continued entrusting himself to him who judges justly. He himself bore our sins in his body on the tree, that we might die to sin and live to righteousness. By his wounds you have been healed. For you were straying like sheep, but have now returned to the Shepherd and Overseer of your souls.

<b>Psalms 127:1</b> - Unless the Lord builds the house, those who build it labor in vain. Unless the Lord watches over the city, the watchman stays awake in vain.
</p>

<p>
<b>Luke 6:47-49</b> - Everyone who comes to me and hears my words and does them, I will show you what he is like: he is like a man building a house, who dug deep and laid the foundation on the rock. And when a flood arose, the stream broke against that house and could not shake it, because it had been well built. But the one who hears and does not do them is like a man who built a house on the ground without a foundation. When the stream broke against it, immediately it fell, and the ruin of that house was great. (ESV)
</p>

<p>
We must throw out the old and allow God to build the new house/life for us.
We must cooperate with God by doing what Jesus has instructed, and not fighting against Jesus' commandments.

<b>Acts 15:8-9</b> - And God, who knows the heart, bore witness to them, by giving them the Holy Spirit just as he did to us, and he made no distinction between us and them, having cleansed their hearts by faith.

<p>
For example, out of faith in trying to follow the 10 Commandments / 2 Great Commandments, the heart is cleaned by the Holy Spirit.

<p>
God and Abram (Abraham) had a real relationship first.
</p>

<p>
God spoke to Abram first, and then Abram <b>obeyed</b>.
Abraham was faithful.
God noticed Abram's faithfulness, and told Abram he would be rewarded.
God gave Abram a promise.
Abram believed God.
</p>

<p>
But God made the first move.
The first move from Abraham's perspective was obedience, followed by belief.
</p>

<p>
The Lord God spoke first - this itself is a gift. We have the Bible and the testimony of others as a gift from God.
We must then believe what is said in the Holy Scriptures and trust it and obey it (put into practice).
</p>

<p>
The Holy Spirit goes to those who obey God, and causes the person to walk in God's precepts - stopping lying, stealing, coveting, idolizing, cheating, etc.
</p>

<p>
<b>Acts 5:32</b> - And we are witnesses to these things, and so is the Holy Spirit, whom God has given to those who obey him. (ESV)
</p>

<p>
Faith involves:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Obedience</li>
<li>Loyalty (faithfulness to God)</li>
<li>God rewarded Abram with a promise</li>
<li>Abram believed God</li>
<li>God counted Abram's belief as righteousness</li>
</ul>

<p>
<b>Genesis 12:1</b> - Now the Lord said to Abram, Go from your country and your kindred and your father's house to the land that I will show you.
</p>

<p>
Abraham <b>obeyed</b> God.
</p>

<p>
<b>Genesis 12:4</b> - So Abram went, as the Lord had told him, and Lot went with him. Abram was seventy-five years old when he departed from Haran.
</p>

<p>
God promised him something, and gave Abram an instruction.
</p>

<p>
<b>Genesis 13:14</b> - The Lord said to Abram, after Lot had separated from him, Lift up your eyes and look from the place where you are, northward and southward and eastward and westward, for all the land that you see I will give to you and to your offspring forever. I will make your offspring as the dust of the earth, so that if one can count the dust of the earth, your offspring also can be counted. Arise, walk through the length and the breadth of the land, for I will give it to you.
</p>

<p>
Abram obeyed.
</p>

<p>
<b>Genesis 13:18</b> - So Abram moved his tent and came and settled by the oaks of Mamre, which are at Hebron, and there he built an altar to the Lord.
</p>

<p>
OBEDIENCE!
</p>

<p>
<b>Hebrews 5:9-10</b> - And being made perfect, he became the source of eternal salvation to all who <b>obey</b> him, being designated by God a high priest after the order of Melchizedek.
</p>

<p>
Abram interacted with Melchizedek, priest of God Most High, blessed by God Most High. Abram was faithful to God even when God wasn't speaking directly to Him. God can see everything though.
</p>

<p>
<b>Genesis 14:18-20</b> - And Melchizedek king of Salem brought out bread and wine. (He was priest of God Most High. ) And he blessed him and said, Blessed be Abram by God Most High, Possessor of heaven and earth; and blessed be God Most High, who has delivered your enemies into your hand! And Abram gave him a tenth of everything.
</p>

<p>
Abram, in an act of faith with faithfulness, displayed loyalty to God. Abram wanted to prove it will be God who has empowered future blessing which Abram has faith about.
</p>

<p>
<b>Genesis 14:21-24</b> - And the king of Sodom said to Abram, Give me the persons, but take the goods for yourself. But Abram said to the king of Sodom, I have lifted my hand to the Lord, God Most High, Possessor of heaven and earth, that I would not take a thread or a sandal strap or anything that is yours, lest you should say, I have made Abram rich. I will take nothing but what the young men have eaten, and the share of the men who went with me. Let Aner, Eshcol, and Mamre take their share.
</p>

<p>
God noticed and gave Abram a vision and made a promise to Abram, and Abram believed God and God counted it to Abram as righteousness.
</p>

<p>
<b>Genesis 15:1</b> - After these things the word of the Lord came to Abram in a vision: Fear not, Abram, I am your shield; your reward shall be very great. But Abram said, O Lord God, what will you give me, for I continue childless, and the heir of my house is Eliezer of Damascus? And Abram said, Behold, you have given me no offspring, and a member of my household will be my heir. And behold, the word of the Lord came to him: This man shall not be your heir; your very own son shall be your heir. And he brought him outside and said, Look toward heaven, and number the stars, if you are able to number them. Then he said to him, So shall your offspring be. And he believed the Lord, and he counted it to him as righteousness.

<div id="outline-container-orgeb47789" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="orgeb47789"><span class="section-number-4">8.2.1.</span> Faith and works - they overlap and are <b>not</b> mutually exclusive!</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-8-2-1">
<p>
<b>James 2:22-25</b> - You see that faith was active along with his works, and faith was completed by his works; and the Scripture was fulfilled that says, Abraham believed God, and it was counted to him as righteousness-and he was called a friend of God. You see that a person is justified by works and not by faith alone. And in the same way was not also Rahab the prostitute justified by works when she received the messengers and sent them out by another way?
</p>

<p>
Anyone who thinks that <b>everyone</b> is saved by faith without any 'work' is kidding themself!
Because they eliminate even continued belief because patient endurance is a work!
There would be no saints.
But I think God can save a person who has belief without work because God is sovereign to save in this way.
</p>

<p>
Anyway, see Revelation and you will see Jesus points out different works for different churches.
</p>

<p>
<b>Revelation of John 2:2</b> - I know your works, your toil and your patient endurance, and how you cannot bear with those who are evil, but have tested those who call themselves apostles and are not, and found them to be false.
</p>

<p>
<b>Revelation of John 2:5</b> - Remember therefore from where you have fallen; repent, and do the works you did at first. If not, I will come to you and remove your lampstand from its place, unless you repent.
</p>

<p>
<b>Revelation of John 2:6</b> - Yet this you have: you hate the works of the Nicolaitans, which I also hate.
</p>

<p>
<b>Revelation of John 2:19</b> - I know your works, your love and faith and service and patient endurance, and that your latter works exceed the first.
</p>

<p>
<b>Revelation of John 2:22-23</b> - Behold, I will throw her onto a sickbed, and those who commit adultery with her I will throw into great tribulation, unless they repent of her works, and I will strike her children dead. And all the churches will know that I am he who searches mind and heart, and <b>I will give to each of you as your works deserve</b>.
</p>

<p>
<b>Revelation of John 3:1-2</b> - And to the angel of the church in Sardis write: The words of him who has the seven spirits of God and the seven stars. I know your works. You have the reputation of being alive, but you are dead. Wake up, and strengthen what remains and is about to die, for I have not found your works complete in the sight of my God.
</p>

<p>
<b>Revelation of John 3:8</b> - I know your works. Behold, I have set before you an open door, which no one is able to shut. I know that you have but little power, and yet you have kept my word and have not denied my name.
</p>

<p>
<b>Revelation of John 3:15</b> - I know your works: you are neither cold nor hot. Would that you were either cold or hot!

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-8-2-2">
<p>
<i><b>Obeying God.</b></i>
</p>

<p>
<b>Hebrews 11:8</b> - By faith Abraham obeyed when he was called to go out to a place that he was to receive as an inheritance. And he went out, not knowing where he was going.
</p>

<p>
<b>Genesis 12:1-3</b> - Now the LORD said to Abram, Go from your country and your kindred and your father's house to the land that I will show you. And I will make of you a great nation, and I will bless you and make your name great, so that you will be a blessing. I will bless those who bless you, and him who dishonors you I will curse, and in you all the families of the earth shall be blessed. (ESV)
</p>

<p>
<i><b>Believing God.</b></i>
</p>

<p>
<b>Genesis 15:1</b> - After these things the word of the Lord came to Abram in a vision: Fear not, Abram, I am your shield; your reward shall be very great. But Abram said, O Lord God, what will you give me, for I continue childless, and the heir of my house is Eliezer of Damascus? And Abram said, Behold, you have given me no offspring, and a member of my household will be my heir. And behold, the word of the Lord came to him: This man shall not be your heir; your very own son shall be your heir. And he brought him outside and said, Look toward heaven, and number the stars, if you are able to number them. Then he said to him, So shall your offspring be. And he believed the Lord, and he counted it to him as righteousness.
</p>

<p>
<i><b>Conviction.</b></i>
</p>

<p>
<b>Hebrews 11:17-19</b> - By faith Abraham, when he was tested, offered up Isaac, and he who had received the promises was in the act of offering up his only son, of whom it was said, Through Isaac shall your offspring be named. He considered that God was able even to raise him from the dead, from which, figuratively speaking, he did receive him back.
</p>

<p>
Like Abraham, a believer's faith may be tested.
</p>

<p>
<i><b>Trust in God.</b></i>,
</p>

<p>
<i><b>Fear of God.</b></i>,
</p>

<p>
<i><b>Testable faith.</b></i>
</p>

<p>
<b>Genesis 22:9-14</b> - When they came to the place of which God had told him, Abraham built the altar there and laid the wood in order and bound Isaac his son and laid him on the altar, on top of the wood. Then Abraham reached out his hand and took the knife to slaughter his son. But the angel of the Lord called to him from heaven and said, Abraham, Abraham! And he said, Here am I. He said, Do not lay your hand on the boy or do anything to him, for now I know that you fear God, seeing you have not withheld your son, your only son, from me. And Abraham lifted up his eyes and looked, and behold, behind him was a ram, caught in a thicket by his horns. And Abraham went and took the ram and offered it up as a burnt offering instead of his son. So Abraham called the name of that place, The Lord will provide; as it is said to this day, On the mount of the Lord it shall be provided.
</p>

<p>
<i><b>Holding onto the promise, even to death if required.</b></i>
</p>

<p>
<b>Hebrews 11:13</b> - These all died in faith, not having received the things promised, but having seen them and greeted them from afar, and having acknowledged that they were strangers and exiles on the earth.
</p>

<p>
Like Abraham, a believer keeps the faith right to the end of their life or until Jesus takes them home.
</p>

<p>
<i><b>Patient endurance / waiting on God (belief * time).</b></i>
</p>

<p>
We should have <b>busy</b> (non-sluggish) faith,
and imitate the faith of people such as
Abraham, so that we inherit the promises.
We can believe those promises which we inherit.
</p>

<p>
<b>Hebrews 6:12-15</b> - so that you may not be sluggish, but imitators of those who through faith and patience inherit the promises. For when God made a promise to Abraham, since he had no one greater by whom to swear, he swore by himself, saying, Surely I will bless you and multiply you. And thus Abraham, having patiently waited, obtained the promise.
</p>

<p>
<b>Revelation of John 3:8</b> - I know your <b>works</b>. Behold, I have set before you an open door, which no one is able to shut. I know that you have but little power, and yet you have <b>kept my word and have not denied my name</b>. Behold, I will make those of the synagogue of Satan who say that they are Jews and are not, but lie-behold, I will make them come and bow down before your feet and they will learn that I have loved you. Because you have kept my word about <b>patient endurance</b>, I will keep you from the hour of trial that is coming on the whole world, to try those who dwell on the earth.

<b>Matthew 21:32</b> - For John came to you in the way of righteousness, and you did not believe him, but the tax collectors and the prostitutes believed him. And even when you saw it, you did not afterward change your minds and believe him. (ESV)
</p>

<p>
To follow the law by faith, I think, is to not lie, commit adultery, idolize, etc. in truth and reality, keeping yourself accountable to God.
</p>

<p>
This is the key, I think, to following the law by faith: <b>praise from God and not men</b>
</p>

<p>
<b>Romans 2:29</b> - But he is a Jew who is one inwardly; and circumcision is that which is of the heart, by the Spirit, not by the letter; and his praise is not from men, but from God.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>John the baptist taught 'turn from sin and believe in the One to come'.</li>
<li>Jesus taught to 'come to and believe in Him (Jesus) for forgiveness and stop sinning'.</li>
</ul>

<b>Acts 3:25-26</b> - You are the sons of the prophets and of the covenant that God made with your fathers, saying to Abraham, And in your offspring shall all the families of the earth be blessed. God, having raised up his servant, <b>sent him to you first, to bless you by turning every one of you from your wickedness</b>.
</p>

<p>
Stopping sinning is important from either angle.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The apostles also taught people to turn from sin, believe and stop sinning.</li>
</ul>

<p>
<b>John 5:14</b> - Afterward Jesus found him in the temple and said to him, See, you are well! Sin no more, that nothing worse may happen to you.
</p>

<p>
<b>Ezekiel 18:20</b> - The soul who sins shall die. The son shall not suffer for the iniquity of the father, nor the father suffer for the iniquity of the son. The righteousness of the righteous shall be upon himself, and the wickedness of the wicked shall be upon himself. (ESV)

<p>
<b>Romans 8:13</b> - For if you live according to the flesh you will die, but if by the Spirit you put to death the deeds of the body, you will live.

<b>Matthew 9:2</b> - And behold, some people brought to him a paralytic, lying on a bed. And when Jesus saw their faith, he said to the paralytic, Take heart, my son; your sins are forgiven.

Forgiven after Jesus saw their faith.
</p>

<p>
<b>Mark 2:5</b> - And when Jesus saw their faith, he said to the paralytic, My son, your sins are forgiven.
</p>

<p>
Acts of faith.
</p>

<p>
<b>Matthew 9:5</b> - For which is easier, to say, Your sins are forgiven, or to say, <b>Rise and walk?</b>
</p>

<p>
<b>Mark 2:9</b> - Which is easier, to say to the paralytic, Your sins are forgiven, or to say, <b>Rise, take up your bed and walk?</b>
</p>

<p>
Turning.

<p>
<b>Mark 4:11-12</b> - And he said to them, To you has been given the secret of the kingdom of God, but for those outside everything is in parables, so that they may indeed see but not perceive, and may indeed hear but not understand, lest they should <b>turn</b> and be forgiven.

In the same way, let your light shine before others, so that they may see your good works and give glory to your Father who is in heaven. Do not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them. For truly, I say to you, until heaven and earth pass away, not an iota, not a dot, will pass from the Law until all is accomplished. Therefore whoever relaxes one of the least of these commandments and teaches others to do the same will be called least in the kingdom of heaven, but whoever does them and teaches them will be called great in the kingdom of heaven. For I tell you, unless your righteousness exceeds that of the scribes and Pharisees, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven. (ESV)

<h3 id="org25b1887"><span class="section-number-3">8.7.</span> Anyone who believes in Him receives forgiveness of sins</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-8-7">
<p>
<b>Acts 10:43:</b> Of Him all <b>the prophets bear witness</b> that <b>through His name</b> everyone who believes in Him receives forgiveness of sins."
</p>

<p>
But before and/or after believing and being forgiven a person needs to also turn away from sin.
To be '<b>saved</b>' I think means:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>for God to forgive one's sins through Jesus Christ, and</li>
<li>for that person to be progressing towards holiness and not away from holiness - towards sanctification and ultimately, eternal life.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>the Holy Spirit helps a person to do that.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>
Becoming a slave of God, rather than sin, the fruit you get leads to sanctification and at the end, eternal life - it leads to knowing the only true God, and Jesus Christ who He sent.
</p>

<p>
<b>Romans 6:16-22</b> - Do you not know that if you present yourselves to anyone as obedient slaves, you are slaves of the one whom you obey, either of sin, which leads to death, or of obedience, which leads to righteousness? But thanks be to God, that you who were once slaves of sin have become obedient from the heart to the standard of teaching to which you were committed, and, having been set free from sin, have become slaves of righteousness. I am speaking in human terms, because of your natural limitations. For just as you once presented your members as slaves to impurity and to lawlessness leading to more lawlessness, so now present your members as slaves to righteousness leading to sanctification. When you were slaves of sin, you were free in regard to righteousness. But what fruit were you getting at that time from the things of which you are now ashamed? The end of those things is death. But now that you have been set free from sin and have become slaves of God, the fruit you get leads to sanctification and its end, <b>eternal life</b>. (ESV)
</p>

<p>
So obedience leads to sanctification which leads to eternal life which is knowing God and Jesus Christ.
</p>

<p>
Repentance from sin is required step for those who are in sin, along with forgiveness, and is followed up with sanctification and eternal life.
</p>

<p>
<b>Luke 15:7</b> - Just so, I tell you, there will be more joy in heaven over one sinner who repents than over ninety-nine righteous persons who need no repentance. (ESV)
</p>

<p>
<b>John 17:3</b> - And this is eternal life, that they know you the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom you have sent.

For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but in order that the world might be saved through him. Whoever believes in him is not condemned, but whoever does not believe is condemned already, because he has not believed in the name of the only Son of God.

<b>Luke 7:8-9</b> - For I too am a man set under authority, with soldiers under me: and I say to one, Go, and he goes; and to another, Come, and he comes; and to my servant, Do this, and he does it. When Jesus heard these things, he marveled at him, and turning to the crowd that followed him, said, I tell you, not even in Israel have I found such faith. (ESV)
</p>

<p>
Since Faith is proportional to Love for God, which is proportional to obeying God, the following can be understood.
</p>

<p>
<b>James 1:12</b> - Blessed is the man who remains steadfast under trial, for when he has stood the test he will receive the crown of life, which God has promised to those who love him.
</p>

<p>
<b>James 2:5</b> - Listen, my beloved brothers, has not God chosen those who are poor in the world to be rich in faith and heirs of the kingdom, which he has promised to those who love him?
</p>

<p>
A person with true faith in God walks into the truth because true faith has eyes fixed on Jesus and goes to Jesus as it obeys the will of God.

<p>
<b>Hebrews 11:1</b> - Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen. (KJV)
</p>

<p>
<b>Hebrews 11:1</b> - Now faith is the assurance of things hoped for, the conviction of things not seen. (ESV)
</p>

<p>
<b>Matthew 17:20</b> - He said to them, Because of your little faith. For truly, I say to you, if you have faith like a grain of mustard seed, you will say to this mountain, Move from here to there, and it will move, and nothing will be impossible for you. (ESV)

<p>
<b>Revelation of John 3:8</b> - I know your <b>works</b>. Behold, I have set before you an open door, which no one is able to shut. I know that you have but little power, and yet you have <b>kept my word and have not denied my name</b>. Behold, I will make those of the synagogue of Satan who say that they are Jews and are not, but lie-behold, I will make them come and bow down before your feet and they will learn that I have loved you. Because you have kept my word about <b>patient endurance</b>, I will keep you from the hour of trial that is coming on the whole world, to try those who dwell on the earth.
</p>

<p>
I think faith is like casting a net to receive something.
</p>

<p>
If you want to catch something big then you need a lot of faith.
</p>

<p>
Faith receives salvation, and salvation is the gift which is received through faith.
Faith is something which a person must have to receive the free gift.
The onus is on us to receive the free gift.
</p>

<p>
We must approach Jesus.
We must repent (change our minds, turning from our wicked ways, and turn to God) and obey God.
God has said many things, about his statutes and about how we should listen to Jesus.
I think repentance (from the heart turning from sin) is still approaching Jesus because Jesus fulfilled the law.
</p>

<p>
Humble yourself and obey God's commandments (not out of pride, but out of authentic faith with God, being accountable to God, in secret).
</p>

<p>
For example, abstaining from partaking in stealing, or adultery and being faithful to God, even if you lose friends over it.
This type of obeying God's commandments is nothing to do with pride or self-exultation or self-righteousness and everything to do with being faithful to God and humbling oneself to God.
</p>

<p>
Trying to turn from sin in truth and reality.
</p>

<p>
<b>2 Chronicles 7:14</b> - if my people who are called by my name humble themselves, and pray and seek my face and turn from their wicked ways, then I will hear from heaven and will forgive their sin and heal their land. (ESV)
</p>

<p>
<b>Matthew 18:3</b> - and said, Truly, I say to you, unless you turn and become like children, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven. (ESV)
</p>

<p>
It says unless <b>you</b> turn - The onus is on you.
</p>

<p>
<b>Matthew 5:20</b> - For I tell you, unless your righteousness exceeds that of the scribes and Pharisees, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven. (ESV)
</p>

<p>
It says unless <b>your</b> righteousness.
</p>

<p>
Faith in Jesus probably qualifies a person to 'enter' the Kingdom of Heaven.
Also, following the law by faith in truth I think qualifies a person to enter the Kingdom of Heaven.
Also the Kingdom of Heaven, I think is from Heaven to Earth.
</p>

<p>
<b>II Corinthians 5:21</b> - For our sake he made him to be sin who knew no sin, so that in him we might become the righteousness of God.
</p>

<p>
<b>Titus 3:7</b> - so that being justified by his grace we might become heirs according to the hope of eternal life.
</p>

<p>
<i><b>Through faith a person is saved (the onus is on us to receive)</b></i>
</p>

<p>
Salvation is the gift.
</p>

<p>
<b>Ephesians 2:8</b> - For by grace you have been saved through faith. And this is not your own doing; it is the gift of God, (ESV)

<li>love, faith, service and patient endurance are all considered works</li>
</ul>

<p>
<b>Revelation of John 2:19</b> - I know your works, your love and faith and service and patient endurance, and that your latter works exceed the first.
</p>

<p>
Abraham's obedience is a work of faith.
</p>

<p>
<b>Hebrews 11:8</b> - By faith Abraham obeyed when he was called to go out to a place that he was to receive as an inheritance. And he went out, not knowing where he was going. (ESV)

<p>
<b>Hebrews 11:6</b> - And without faith it is impossible to please him, for whoever would draw near to God <b>must believe that he exists and that he rewards those who seek him.</b> (ESV)
</p>

<p>
Work substantiates faith because it is the act of receiving from God.
</p>

<p>
A work of faith could indeed be following the law in faith (as opposed to following the law by works).
</p>

<p>
For example, keeping your integrity, remaining faithful to God and not lying to God.
</p>

<p>
Patient endurance is a 'work of faith'.
</p>

<p>

And in the same way was not also Rahab the prostitute justified by works when she received the messengers and sent them out by another way? For as the body apart from the spirit is dead, so also faith apart from works is dead. (ESV)

<p>
This is not a work of the law, but it is a work of faith: "<i>when she received the messengers and sent them out by another way</i>"

I have found that choosing a relationship correctly, based on truth, and the fruit of the Spirit, etc. is contrary to worldly precepts.

If you want to marry someone and other people say no because of human precepts, etc. with no acknowledgement of what is right Biblically,
those human precepts serve to steal the blessings that God has for you - it goes against the spirit.

They will encourage sinful behavior, thinking that is good.

Never! Or do you not know that he who is joined to a prostitute becomes one body with her? For, as it is written, The two will become one flesh. But he who is joined to the Lord becomes one spirit with him. Flee from sexual immorality. Every other sin a person commits is outside the body, but the sexually immoral person sins against his own body.

<b>John 3:16-21</b> - For God so loved the world, that he gave his only Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life. For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but in order that the world might be saved through him. Whoever believes in him is not condemned, but whoever does not believe is condemned already, because he has not believed in the name of the only Son of God. And this is the judgment: the light has come into the world, and people loved the darkness rather than the light because their deeds were evil. For everyone who does wicked things hates the light and does not come to the light, lest his deeds should be exposed. But whoever does what is true comes to the light, so that it may be clearly seen that his deeds have been carried out in God. (ESV)

For out of Zion shall go forth the law, and the word of the LORD from Jerusalem. He shall judge between many peoples, and shall decide for strong nations afar off; and they shall beat their swords into plowshares, and their spears into pruning hooks; nation shall not lift up sword against nation, neither shall they learn war anymore; but they shall sit every man under his vine and under his fig tree, and no one shall make them afraid, for the mouth of the LORD of hosts has spoken. For all the peoples walk each in the name of its god, but we will walk in the name of the LORD our God forever and ever. In that day, declares the LORD, I will assemble the lame and gather those who have been driven away and those whom I have afflicted; and the lame I will make the remnant, and those who were cast off, a strong nation; and the LORD will reign over them in Mount Zion from this time forth and forevermore. And you, O tower of the flock, hill of the daughter of Zion, to you shall it come, the former dominion shall come, kingship for the daughter of Jerusalem. Now why do you cry aloud? Is there no king in you? Has your counselor perished, that pain seized you like a woman in labor? Writhe and groan, O daughter of Zion, like a woman in labor, for now you shall go out from the city and dwell in the open country; you shall go to Babylon. There you shall be rescued; there the LORD will redeem you from the hand of your enemies. Now many nations are assembled against you, saying, Let her be defiled, and let our eyes gaze upon Zion. But they do not know the thoughts of the LORD; they do not understand his plan, that he has gathered them as sheaves to the threshing floor.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-19">
<p>
I currently believe this means that grace may
exist for gay people who have faith in Jesus
but they are accountable to God for it, and
they wont <b>inherit</b> the kingdom of God and His saints.
</p>

<p>
Also, I think eternal life is for those who a) receive forgiveness from Jesus, b) obey Jesus and become a bondservant of God.
</p>

<p>
<b>Romans 6:22</b> - But now that you have been set free from sin and have become slaves of God, the fruit you get leads to sanctification and its end, eternal life.
</p>

<p>
This is my current understanding. Is this correct?
</p>

<p>
I 100% believe that anyone who puts faith in Jesus Christ for their righteousness can be saved / spared from being condemned to hell.
</p>

<p>
But that doesn't mean they inherit the Kingdom.
And it doesn't excuse them from repentance from sin.
But they're accountable for God to it.
</p>

<p>
Repentance is <b>essential</b> for eternal life.
</p>

<p>
<b>John 8:34-35</b> - Jesus answered them, Truly, truly, I say to you, everyone who commits sin is a slave to sin. The slave does not remain in the house forever; the son remains forever.
</p>

<p>
Also, the Kingdom stretches from heaven to earth, so gay 'marriage' may happen on earth but such a thing could never exist in heaven.
</p>

<p>
But neither does marriage between man and woman even exist in heaven.
</p>

<p>
But those who practice sexual impurity which includes homosexuality wont <b>inherit</b> the kingdom, nor enter into the New Jerusalem in Heaven - those are for the saints (those who keep God's commandments AND have faith in Jesus).
</p>

<p>
But can they <b>enter</b> the kingdom on earth? Maybe. I believe so, actually, with the righteousness of God through faith in Jesus Christ.
</p>

<p>
<b>Matthew 6:10</b> - Your kingdom come, your will be done, on earth as it is in heaven.
</p>

<p>
I don't think God ever endorses people to sin, but has grace for sinners.

<b>Revelation of John 22:15</b> - Outside are the dogs and sorcerers and the sexually immoral and murderers and idolaters, and everyone who loves and practices falsehood. (ESV)

Amen. For this reason God gave them up to dishonorable passions. For their women exchanged natural relations for those that are contrary to nature; and the men likewise gave up natural relations with women and were consumed with passion for one another, men committing shameless acts with men and receiving in themselves the due penalty for their error. And since they did not see fit to acknowledge God, God gave them up to a debased mind to do what ought not to be done. They were filled with all manner of unrighteousness, evil, covetousness, malice. They are full of envy, murder, strife, deceit, maliciousness. They are gossips, slanderers, haters of God, insolent, haughty, boastful, inventors of evil, disobedient to parents, foolish, faithless, heartless, ruthless.

<b>John 20:31</b> - but these are written so that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that by believing you may have life in his name. (ESV)
</p>

<p>
<b>Exodus 23:21</b> - Pay attention to him, and listen to his voice. Don't provoke him, for he will not pardon your disobedience, for my name is in him.
</p>

<p>
God's name was <b>in</b> the angel:
</p>

<p>
<b>Exodus 23:20-22</b> - Behold, I send an angel before you to guard you on the way and to bring you to the place that I have prepared. Pay careful attention to him and obey his voice; do not rebel against him, for he will not pardon your transgression, for my name is in him. But if you <b>carefully obey his voice and do all that I say</b>, then I will be an enemy to your enemies and an adversary to your adversaries.
</p>

<p>
Believing is just the starting point. This is honestly just the starting point. Obedience is <b>expected</b>. Also, Jesus is forgiving, unlike the angel.
</p>

<p>
Continuing to trust in Jesus as the Messiah, your Saviour, and the Only-begotten Son of God through patient endurance is enough to get saved, I think, but it's not enough to be counted a 'disciple' of Jesus.
</p>

<p>
And it's 'saved' but 'being saved' at the same time.
</p>

<p>
One wants to progress from 'believing that' to having Jesus abide inside them.
</p>

<p>
I think that rejects His commandments but claiming to believe in Jesus Christ as the Son of God is an extremely precarious, and tentative position to be in,
and may indicate that the person doesn't <b>really</b> believe.
</p>

<p>
And if a person doesn't believe in reality, then that person probably isn't saved - so they are only lying to themself that they are saved.
</p>

<p>
<b>However</b>, if a person trusts him who justifies the ungodly, his faith is counted as righteousness.
</p>

<p>
<b>Romans 4:5</b> - And to the one who does not work but trusts him who justifies the ungodly, his faith is counted as righteousness,
</p>

This qualifies:

Jesus said to him, If you would be perfect, go, sell what you possess and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; and come, follow me. When the young man heard this he went away sorrowful, for he had great possessions. And Jesus said to his disciples, Truly, I say to you, only with difficulty will a rich person enter the kingdom of heaven. Again I tell you, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich person to enter the kingdom of God. When the disciples heard this, they were greatly astonished, saying, Who then can be saved? But Jesus looked at them and said, With man this is impossible, but with God all things are possible. Then Peter said in reply, See, we have left everything and followed you. What then will we have? Jesus said to them, Truly, I say to you, in the new world, when the Son of Man will sit on his glorious throne, you who have followed me will also sit on twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel. And everyone who has left houses or brothers or sisters or father or mother or children or lands, for my name's sake, will receive a hundredfold and will inherit eternal life.

Jesus then said to them, Truly, truly, I say to you, it was not Moses who gave you the bread from heaven, but my Father gives you the true bread from heaven. For the bread of God is he who comes down from heaven and gives life to the world. They said to him, Sir, give us this bread always. Jesus said to them, I am the bread of life; whoever comes to me shall not hunger, and whoever believes in me shall never thirst. But I said to you that you have seen me and yet do not believe. All that the Father gives me will come to me, and whoever comes to me I will never cast out. For I have come down from heaven, not to do my own will but the will of him who sent me. And this is the will of him who sent me, that I should lose nothing of all that he has given me, but raise it up on the last day. For this is the will of my Father, that everyone who looks on the Son and believes in him should have eternal life, and I will raise him up on the last day.

<b>John 15</b> - I am the true vine, and my Father is the vinedresser. Every branch of mine that does not bear fruit he takes away, and every branch that does bear fruit he prunes, that it may bear more fruit. Already you are clean because of the word that I have spoken to you. Abide in me, and I in you. As the branch cannot bear fruit by itself, unless it abides in the vine, neither can you, unless you abide in me. I am the vine; you are the branches. Whoever abides in me and I in him, he it is that bears much fruit, for apart from me you can do nothing. If anyone does not abide in me he is thrown away like a branch and withers; and the branches are gathered, thrown into the fire, and burned. If you abide in me, and my words abide in you, ask whatever you wish, and it will be done for you. By this my Father is glorified, that you bear much fruit and so prove to be my disciples. As the Father has loved me, so have I loved you. Abide in my love. If you keep my commandments, you will abide in my love, just as I have kept my Father's commandments and abide in his love. These things I have spoken to you, that my joy may be in you, and that your joy may be full. This is my commandment, that you love one another as I have loved you. Greater love has no one than this, that someone lays down his life for his friends. You are my friends if you do what I command you. No longer do I call you servants, for the servant does not know what his master is doing; but I have called you friends, for all that I have heard from my Father I have made known to you. You did not choose me, but I chose you and appointed you that you should go and bear fruit and that your fruit should abide, so that whatever you ask the Father in my name, he may give it to you. These things I command you, so that you will love one another. If the world hates you, know that it has hated me before it hated you. If you were of the world, the world would love you as its own; but because you are not of the world, but I chose you out of the world, therefore the world hates you. Remember the word that I said to you: A servant is not greater than his master. If they persecuted me, they will also persecute you. If they kept my word, they will also keep yours. But all these things they will do to you on account of my name, because they do not know him who sent me. If I had not come and spoken to them, they would not have been guilty of sin, but now they have no excuse for their sin. Whoever hates me hates my Father also. If I had not done among them the works that no one else did, they would not be guilty of sin, but now they have seen and hated both me and my Father. But the word that is written in their Law must be fulfilled: They hated me without a cause. But when the Helper comes, whom I will send to you from the Father, the Spirit of truth, who proceeds from the Father, he will bear witness about me. And you also will bear witness, because you have been with me from the beginning.

<p>
<b>Romans 11</b> - I ask, then, has God rejected his people? By no means! For I myself am an Israelite, a descendant of Abraham, a member of the tribe of Benjamin. God has not rejected his people whom he foreknew. Do you not know what the Scripture says of Elijah, how he appeals to God against Israel? Lord, they have killed your prophets, they have demolished your altars, and I alone am left, and they seek my life. But what is God's reply to him? I have kept for myself seven thousand men who have not bowed the knee to Baal. So too at the present time there is a remnant, chosen by grace. But if it is by grace, it is no longer on the basis of works; otherwise grace would no longer be grace. What then? Israel failed to obtain what it was seeking. The elect obtained it, but the rest were hardened, as it is written, God gave them a spirit of stupor, eyes that would not see and ears that would not hear, down to this very day. And David says, Let their table become a snare and a trap, a stumbling block and a retribution for them; let their eyes be darkened so that they cannot see, and bend their backs forever. So I ask, did they stumble in order that they might fall? By no means! Rather through their trespass salvation has come to the Gentiles, so as to make Israel jealous. Now if their trespass means riches for the world, and if their failure means riches for the Gentiles, how much more will their full inclusion mean! Now I am speaking to you Gentiles. Inasmuch then as I am an apostle to the Gentiles, I magnify my ministry in order somehow to make my fellow Jews jealous, and thus save some of them. For if their rejection means the reconciliation of the world, what will their acceptance mean but life from the dead? If the dough offered as firstfruits is holy, so is the whole lump, and if the root is holy, so are the branches. But if some of the branches were broken off, and you, although a wild olive shoot, were grafted in among the others and now share in the nourishing root of the olive tree, do not be arrogant toward the branches. If you are, remember it is not you who support the root, but the root that supports you. Then you will say, Branches were broken off so that I might be grafted in. That is true. They were broken off because of their unbelief, but you stand fast through faith. So do not become proud, but stand in awe. For if God did not spare the natural branches, neither will he spare you. Note then the kindness and the severity of God: severity toward those who have fallen, but God's kindness to you, provided you continue in his kindness. Otherwise you too will be cut off. And even they, if they do not continue in their unbelief, will be grafted in, for God has the power to graft them in again. For if you were cut from what is by nature a wild olive tree, and grafted, contrary to nature, into a cultivated olive tree, how much more will these, the natural branches, be grafted back into their own olive tree. Lest you be wise in your own conceits, I want you to understand this mystery, brothers: a partial hardening has come upon Israel, until the fullness of the Gentiles has come in. And in this way all Israel will be saved, as it is written, The Deliverer will come from Zion, he will banish ungodliness from Jacob; and this will be my covenant with them when I take away their sins. As regards the gospel, they are enemies of God for your sake. But as regards election, they are beloved for the sake of their forefathers. For the gifts and the calling of God are irrevocable. Just as you were at one time disobedient to God but now have received mercy because of their disobedience, so they too have now been disobedient in order that by the mercy shown to you they also may now receive mercy. For God has consigned all to disobedience, that he may have mercy on all. Oh, the depth of the riches and wisdom and knowledge of God! How unsearchable are his judgments and how inscrutable his ways! For who has known the mind of the Lord, or who has been his counselor? Or who has given a gift to him that he might be repaid? For from him and through him and to him are all things. To him be glory forever. Amen. (ESV)

<b>Matthew 12:33-37</b> - Either make the tree good and its fruit good, or make the tree bad and its fruit bad, for the tree is known by its fruit. You brood of vipers! How can you speak good, when you are evil? For out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks. The good person out of his good treasure brings forth good, and the evil person out of his evil treasure brings forth evil. I tell you, on the day of judgment people will give account for every careless word they speak, for by your words you will be justified, and by your words you will be condemned. (ESV)

No one who abides in him keeps on sinning; no one who keeps on sinning has either seen him or known him. Little children, let no one deceive you. Whoever practices righteousness is righteous, as he is righteous. Whoever makes a practice of sinning is of the devil, for the devil has been sinning from the beginning. The reason the Son of God appeared was to destroy the works of the devil. No one born of God makes a practice of sinning, for God's seed abides in him, and he cannot keep on sinning because he has been born of God. By this it is evident who are the children of God, and who are the children of the devil: whoever does not practice righteousness is not of God, nor is the one who does not love his brother. For this is the message that you have heard from the beginning, that we should love one another.

My son, do not regard lightly the discipline of the Lord, nor be weary when reproved by him. For the Lord disciplines the one he loves, and chastises every son whom he receives. It is for discipline that you have to endure. God is treating you as sons. For what son is there whom his father does not discipline? <b>If you are left without discipline, in which all have participated, then you are illegitimate children and not sons</b>. Besides this, we have had earthly fathers who disciplined us and we respected them. Shall we not much more be subject to the Father of spirits and live?

First be reconciled to your brother, and then come and offer your gift. Come to terms quickly with your accuser while you are going with him to court, lest your accuser hand you over to the judge, and the judge to the guard, and you be put in prison. (ESV)

And he said to them, Did you receive the Holy Spirit when you believed? And they said, No, we have not even heard that there is a Holy Spirit. And he said, Into what then were you baptized? They said, Into John's baptism. And Paul said, John baptized with the baptism of repentance, telling the people to believe in the one who was to come after him, that is, Jesus. On hearing this, they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus. And when Paul had laid his hands on them, the Holy Spirit came on them, and they began speaking in tongues and prophesying.

There is only one who is good. If you would enter life, keep the commandments. He said to him, Which ones? And Jesus said, You shall not murder, You shall not commit adultery, You shall not steal, You shall not bear false witness, Honor your father and mother, and, You shall love your neighbor as yourself. The young man said to him, All these I have kept. What do I still lack? Jesus said to him, If you would be perfect, go, sell what you possess and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; and come, follow me. When the young man heard this he went away sorrowful, for he had great possessions. And Jesus said to his disciples, Truly, I say to you, only with difficulty will a rich person enter the kingdom of heaven. Again I tell you, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich person to enter the kingdom of God. When the disciples heard this, they were greatly astonished, saying, Who then can be saved? But Jesus looked at them and said, With man this is impossible, but with God all things are possible.

I was born-again on 2 April 2022. On 1 April 2022 (one day before) I was wearing a pendant which on one side I had written 1023 which is decimal for the binary 1111111111 - which are ten ones. I was trying hard to follow the ten commandments from the heart, like Jesus teaches. I was doing this to seek Jesus. Then I was born-again. What a mystery.

<b>Ezekiel 11:19-20</b> - And I will give them one heart, and a new spirit I will put within them.

And they shall be my people, and I will be their God. (ESV)
</p>

<p>
God gives the Spirit to help keep the commandments. When she says the gospel is loving your neighbour, she is actually speaking part of the gospel. In the way that the man on the cross next to Jesus also spoke part of the full gospel message. They deserve the punishment but Jesus has done no wrong.
</p>

<p>
Since then I've been trying to follow Jesus' commandments to get to know Him out of love for God, and because He has commanded His disciples to be fruitful for Him, and to abide in Him.
</p>

<p>
I had my belief in Jesus Christ and I had taken small steps of faith in remaining loyal to Jesus.

<p>
When a person is born-again of the Spirit, they receive the Spirit which helps them to stop sinning. It's really important to stop sinning.
</p>

<p>
<b>1 Peter 1:23</b> - since you have been born again, not of perishable seed but of imperishable, through the living and abiding word of God; (ESV)
</p>

<p>
<b>1 John 5:18</b> - We know that everyone who has been born of God does not keep on sinning, but he who was born of God protects him, and the evil one does not touch him. (ESV)
</p>

<p>
<b>Ezekiel 11:19-20</b> - And I will give them one heart, and a new spirit I will put within them. I will remove the heart of stone from their flesh and give them a heart of flesh, that they may walk in my statutes and keep my rules and obey them. And they shall be my people, and I will be their God. (ESV)
</p>

<p>
<b>I John 3:9</b> - No one born of God makes a practice of sinning, for God's seed abides in him, and he cannot keep on sinning because he has been born of God.
</p>

<p>
But I would much like my dream life to be like the following:
</p>

<p>
<b>John 5:19</b> - So Jesus said to them, Truly, truly, I say to you, the Son can do nothing of his own accord, but only what he sees the Father doing. For whatever the Father does, that the Son does likewise.
</p>

<p>
Whoever loves in the way Jesus loved us and the way Jesus commanded us has been born of God and knows God.
</p>

<p>
<b>I John 4:7</b> - Beloved, let us love one another, for love is from God, and whoever loves has been born of God and knows God.
</p>

<p>
Anyone who <b>truly believes</b>.
</p>

<p>
<b>I John 5:1</b> - Everyone who believes that Jesus is the Christ has been born of God, and everyone who loves the Father loves whoever has been born of him.
</p>

<p>
<b>I John 5:4</b> - For everyone who has been born of God overcomes the world. And this is the victory that has overcome the world-our faith.
</p>

<p>
<b>I John 5:18</b> - We know that everyone who has been born of God does not keep on sinning, but he who was born of God protects him, and the evil one does not touch him.
</p>

<p>
I feel like stopping sin is very important after being born again.
</p>

<p>
<b>John 5:14</b> - Afterward Jesus found him in the temple and said to him, See, you are well! Sin no more, that nothing worse may happen to you.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-23-4">
<p>
Justification by faith is the correct teaching but the promise is for the gentiles AND the adherent of the law but they all must have faith, and pursuing the law as if by works is the problem, but pursuing the law by faith is ok.
</p>

<p>
<b>Romans 7:22</b> - For I delight in the law of God, in my inner being, (ESV)
</p>

<p>
<b>Romans 9:30-32</b> - What shall we say, then? That Gentiles who did not pursue righteousness have attained it, that is, a righteousness that is by faith; but that Israel who pursued a law that would lead to righteousness did not succeed in reaching that law. Why? Because they did not pursue it by faith, but as if it were based on works. They have stumbled over the stumbling stone, (ESV)
</p>

<p>
<b>Romans 4:15-16</b> - For the law brings wrath, but where there is no law there is no transgression. That is why it depends on faith, in order that the promise may rest on grace and be guaranteed to all his offspring-not only to the adherent of the law but also to the one who shares the faith of Abraham, who is the father of us all, (ESV)

<h4 id="org2254cf7"><span class="section-number-4">23.6.1.</span> God is the one who justifies</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-23-6-1">
<p>
<b>Romans 8:33</b> - Who shall bring any charge against God's elect? It is God who justifies.
</p>

<p>
<b>Romans 8:30</b> - And those whom he predestined he also called, and those whom he called he also justified, and those whom he justified he also glorified. (ESV)
</p>

<p>
But repentance is a work of the heart which is an act of faith.
I believe repentance is inseparable from faith because intrinsic to faith is belief and intrinsic to belief is metanoia (changing one's mind).
</p>

<p>
At it's most basic form repentance means a person believes in Jesus as the Son of God and the Messiah who, being innocent, paid the price for their sin through His broken body and shed blood on the cross - a perfect and eternal offering; that He died there but God resurrected Him, and He is Lord of Heaven and Earth.
</p>

<p>
But I believe we are forgiven to forgive others. That must be part of the act of faith and the change of heart, I think.
</p>

<p>
<b>Matthew 6:15</b> - but if you do not forgive others their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses. (ESV)

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-23-6-2">
<p>
<b>James 2:10</b> - For whoever keeps the whole law but fails in one point has become accountable for all of it. For he who said, Do not commit adultery, also said, Do not murder. If you do not commit adultery but do murder, you have become a transgressor of the law. So speak and so act as those who are to be judged under the law of liberty. For judgment is without mercy to one who has shown no mercy. Mercy triumphs over judgment. What good is it, my brothers, if someone says he has faith but does not have works? Can that faith save him? If a brother or sister is poorly clothed and lacking in daily food, and one of you says to them, Go in peace, be warmed and filled, without giving them the things needed for the body, what good is that? So also faith by itself, if it does not have works, is dead. But someone will say, You have faith and I have works. Show me your faith apart from your works, and I will show you my faith by my works. You believe that God is one; you do well. Even the demons believe-and shudder! Do you want to be shown, you foolish person, that faith apart from works is useless? Was not Abraham our father justified by works when he offered up his son Isaac on the altar? You see that faith was active along with his works, and faith was completed by his works; and the Scripture was fulfilled that says, Abraham believed God, and it was counted to him as righteousness-and he was called a friend of God. You see that a person is justified by works and not by faith alone.
</p>

<p>
I tend to agree with James on this.
Eliminating works from faith is not good.
</p>

<p>
Works:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>obedience</li>
<li>faithfulness
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>keeping God's commandments</li>
</ul></li>
<li>trust</li>
<li>fear of God</li>
<li>response of love
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>thankfulness</li>
<li>praise</li>
<li>forgiving others</li>
</ul></li>
<li>humility
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>keeping God's commandments</li>
</ul></li>
<li>patient endurance (time)</li>
</ul>

<p>
If a person believes that Jesus Christ is the Son of the Living God then they abide in Christ.
But do they <b>really</b> believe? Because if they don't <b>really</b> believe it deep down then but are lying to themself they may not abide in Christ at all.
How can a person believe without having a relationship with God? A relationship involves more than belief.
</p>

<p>
If a person does not have obedience, trust and
repentance from sin, but their faith has belief, then they only
abide in Jesus extremely precariously, and also that person's 'faith' probably wont receive much at all from God.

<p>
Justified through (G1223 dia) faith (G4102 <b>pistis</b>) in Christ (G5547 Christos) Jesus (G2424 Iesous).
Pistis is a strong word for faith that doesn't merely encapsulate belief, but it includes trust.
</p>

<p>
The greeks can turn the noun faith into the verb believing faith (G4100 pisteuo).
It's not the noun 'believe' as the root of the verb faith
</p>

<p>
<i><b>we have believed (G4100 pisteuo) in Christ</b></i> means we have <i><b>'faithed'</b></i> in Christ.
</p>

<p>
The 'believing faith' verb pisteuo has a root of faith (pistis).
</p>

<p>
Faith is a relationship with God.
Before Abraham believed God, he obeyed God.
Faith requires belief but it's more than belief.

<b>I Timothy 4:1</b>: But the Spirit (G4151 pneuma) explicitly says that in later times some will fall away from the faith (G4102 pistis), paying attention to deceitful spirits (G4151 pneuma) and doctrines of demons (G1140 daimonion), (NASB)
</p>

<p>
Faith is ongoing. Ongoing faith is patience endurance. Jesus says patience endurance is a work.
</p>

<p>
<b>Revelation of John 2:19</b> - I know your works, your love and faith and service and patient endurance, and that your latter works exceed the first.

<p>
<b>Romans 4:2</b> - For if Abraham was justified by works, he has something to boast about, but not before God.
</p>

<p>
Paul doesn't deny that Abraham could have been
justified by works, but he claims that Abraham
doesn't have anything to boast about before
God.
</p>

<p>
<b>Romans 4:5</b> - And to the one who does not work but trusts him who justifies the ungodly, his faith is counted as righteousness,
</p>

<p>
So Paul says that for someone who does not
have any works but trusts Him who justifies
the ungodly, the person's trusting faith is
counted as righteousness.
</p>

<p>
AMEN!! God is good for justifying people who are poor of spirit, and have fear of God.

For everything created by God is good, and nothing is to be rejected if it is received with thanksgiving, for it is made holy by the word of God and prayer. If you put these things before the brothers, you will be a good servant of Christ Jesus, being trained in the words of the faith and of the good doctrine that you have followed. Have nothing to do with irreverent, silly myths. Rather train yourself for godliness; for while bodily training is of some value, godliness is of value in every way, as it holds promise for the present life and also for the life to come. (ESV)

Also I saw the souls of those who had been beheaded for the testimony of Jesus and for the word of God, and who had not worshiped the beast or its image and had not received its mark on their foreheads or their hands. They came to life and reigned with Christ for a thousand years. (ESV)

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-25-1-1">
<p>
Glorification is the good works including forgiving others, relieving others' burdens, etc. suffering for the sake of righteousness and obedience to God.
</p>

<p>
Imitating Jesus, forgiving others, walking righteously, and doing good works (bearing one-another's burdens) glorifies Jesus and glorifies God.
</p>

<p>
This should never replace Jesus, but glorifies Jesus because it's being a disciple of Jesus.
</p>

<p>
<b>Hebrews 2:10</b> - For it was fitting for Him, for whom (G3739 hos) are all (G3956 pas) things (G3956 pas), and through whom (G3739 hos) are all (G3956 pas) things (G3956 pas), in <b>bringing many sons to glory</b> (G1391 doxa), to perfect (G5048 teleioo) the author of their salvation (G4991 soteria) through sufferings.
</p>

<p>
If someone's lord is money and not Jesus and then they try to do good works such as setting up businesses, I feel like this glorifies money, not Jesus.
</p>

<p>
Here, Zacchaeus, renounces money and makes Jesus his Lord. This must happen first.
</p>

<p>
<b>Luke 19:8</b> - And Zacchaeus stood and said to the Lord, Behold, Lord, the half of my goods I give to the poor. And if I have defrauded anyone of anything, I restore it fourfold. (ESV)
</p>

<p>
Abram did this too. It's a necessary act of faith.
</p>

<p>
<b>Genesis 14:20-24</b> - and blessed be God Most High, who has delivered your enemies into your hand! And Abram gave him a tenth of everything. And the king of Sodom said to Abram, Give me the persons, but take the goods for yourself. But Abram said to the king of Sodom, I have lifted my hand to the Lord, God Most High, Possessor of heaven and earth, that I would not take a thread or a sandal strap or anything that is yours, lest you should say, I have made Abram rich. I will take nothing but what the young men have eaten, and the share of the men who went with me. Let Aner, Eshcol, and Mamre take their share.
</p>

<p>
<b>Genesis 15:1</b> - After these things the word of the Lord came to Abram in a vision: Fear not, Abram, I am your shield; your reward shall be very great.

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-25-1-2">
<p>
For example, to truly obey God and love / do no harm to one's neighbour involves relieving other's burdens as they ask more from you.
</p>

<p>
<b>Philippians 2:8</b> - And being found in human form, he humbled himself by becoming obedient to the point of death, even death on a cross.
</p>

<p>
Jesus endured the weight of His cross to lighten our burden.
</p>

<p>
<b>Hebrews 12:3</b> - Consider him who endured from sinners such hostility against himself, so that you may not grow weary or fainthearted.
</p>

<p>
We are called to do the same, lightening the burdens of others.
We are forgiven and given grace, then we can choose to forgive others and lighten their burdens - grace propagates.
</p>

<p>
<b>Hebrews 12:4-6</b> - In your struggle against sin you have not yet resisted to the point of shedding your blood. And have you forgotten the exhortation that addresses you as sons? My son, do not regard lightly the discipline of the Lord, nor be weary when reproved by him. For the Lord disciplines the one he loves, and chastises every son whom he receives.
</p>

<p>
<b>Hebrews 12:10</b> - For they disciplined us for a short time as it seemed best to them, but he disciplines us for our good, that we may share his holiness.

<p>
<b>Proverbs 19:11</b> - Good sense makes one slow to anger, and it is his glory to overlook an offense. (ESV)
</p>

<p>
<b>Ephesians 4:32</b> - Be kind to one another, tenderhearted, forgiving one another, as God in Christ forgave you. (ESV)
</p>

<p>
You are required to:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>forgive others for your sake</li>
<li>forgive others for their sake</li>
<li>forgive others as a response of love to Jesus for your sins being forgiven</li>
<li>to be able to forgive others is a gift to you and part of glorification</li>
</ul>

<p>
This is simultaneously required and is part of glorification/holiness.
</p>

<p>
I think there's something very important about forgiving others especially for things which happen after being born-again of the Spirit and receiving the Holy Spirit.
</p>

<p>
<b>Colossians 3:13</b> - bearing with one another and, if one has a complaint against another, forgiving each other; as the Lord has forgiven you, so you also must forgive.
</p>

<p>
<b>John 20:21-23</b> - Jesus said to them again, Peace be with you. As the Father has sent me, even so I am sending you. And when he had said this, he breathed on them and said to them, Receive the Holy Spirit. If you forgive the sins of anyone, they are forgiven; if you withhold forgiveness from anyone, it is withheld.
</p>

<p>
Especially immediately after receiving the Holy Spirit, Jesus forgives those who you forgive - this is partaking in the process of forgiveness.
</p>

<p>
Jesus is the one who forgives sin, but we actually participate in propagating that forgiveness.
</p>

<p>
<i><b>Forgiving others entirely is also required</b></i>
</p>

<p>
Jesus can forgive others even if you do not, but Father God cannot forgive you unless you forgive.
</p>

<p>
<b>Matthew 6:12</b> - and forgive us our debts, as we also have forgiven our debtors.
</p>

<p>
<b>Matthew 6:14-15</b> - For if you forgive others their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you,

<p>
<b>Mark 12:41-44</b> - And he sat down opposite the treasury and watched the people putting money into the offering box. Many rich people put in large sums. And a poor widow came and put in two small copper coins, which make a penny. And he called his disciples to him and said to them, Truly, I say to you, this poor widow has put in more than all those who are contributing to the offering box. For they all contributed out of their abundance, but s he out of her poverty has put in everything she had, all she had to live on. (ESV)
</p>

<p>
Dominating others in your flock is like witchcraft, and will forfeit glorification.
</p>

<p>
<b>1 Peter 5:1-4</b> - So I exhort the elders among you, as a fellow elder and a witness of the sufferings of Christ, as well as a partaker in the <b>glory</b> that is going to be revealed: shepherd the flock of God that is among you, exercising oversight, not under compulsion, but willingly, as God would have you; not for shameful gain, but eagerly; <b>not domineering</b> over those in your charge, but being examples to the flock.
