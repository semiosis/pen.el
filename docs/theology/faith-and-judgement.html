<p>
This document has been a work in progress. I have been born-again and have done my own Bible study, and I'm happy with what I have written here.
I'm trying to speak the truth in mercy. This document shows my current understanding at the time of writing. I'm not judging people. This is just
a Bible study. I hope it spreads some light on the Scriptures.

Almost all of verses are taken from the ESV

I believe we are set free from being condemned by / under the Mosaic Law to become a slave to Christ Jesus under grace.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Romans 8:1-2</b> - There is therefore now no condemnation for those <span class="underline">who are in Christ Jesus.</span> For the law of the Spirit of life has set you free in Christ Jesus from the law of sin and death. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>John 3:18</b> - <b>Whoever believes in him is not condemned</b>, but whoever does not believe is condemned already, because he has not believed in the name of the only Son of God. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Romans 15:17-18</b> - In Christ Jesus, then, I have reason to be proud of my work for God. For I will not venture to speak of anything except what Christ has accomplished through me to bring the Gentiles to <b>obedience—by word and deed,</b>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
In Christ Jesus there is freedom from things which were bad for us, including selfishness, sin and death:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>II Corinthians 3:17</b> - Now the Lord is the Spirit, and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
I believe this. If anyone is trusting that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, then they have life in His name. That doesn't mean they have come to know Him yet.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>John 20:31</b> - but these are written so that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that by believing you may have life in his name. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Belief in Jesus Christ turns to obedience, and imitating Christ:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>John 14:12</b> - Truly, truly, I say to you, whoever believes in me will also do the works that I do; and greater works than these will he do, because I am going to the Father. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
As we go ahead, we <b>must</b> abide in the teaching of Christ, or we won't have God:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>II John 1:9</b> - Everyone who goes on ahead and does not abide in the teaching of Christ, does not have God. Whoever abides in the teaching has both the Father and the Son. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
To know Jesus, we must obey His commandments.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>I John 2:4</b> - Whoever says I know him but does not keep his commandments is a liar, and the truth is not in him,
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
We have to put sin away after we come to believe in Him:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Colossians 3:5-10</b> - Put to death therefore what is earthly in you: sexual immorality, impurity, passion, evil desire, and covetousness, which is idolatry. On account of these the wrath of God is coming. In these you too once walked, when you were living in them. But now you must put them all away: anger, wrath, malice, slander, and obscene talk from your mouth. Do not lie to one another, seeing that you have put off the old self with its practices and have put on the new self, which is being renewed in knowledge after the image of its creator.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
A new creation lives for Christ:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>II Corinthians 5:14-17</b> - For the love of Christ controls us, because we have concluded this: that one has died for all, therefore all have died; and <span class="underline">he died for all, that those who live might no longer live for themselves but for him</span> who for their sake died and was raised. From now on, therefore, we regard no one according to the flesh. Even though we once regarded Christ according to the flesh, we regard him thus no longer. Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation. The old has passed away; behold, the new has come.
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Matthew 20:27-28</b> - and whoever would be first among you must be your slave, even as the Son of Man came not to be served but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
We must be in Christ Jesus. Those who have been born-again have become obedient to Jesus Christ. We must be born-again. This is Scripture and trumps my own thoughts. I affirm these verses wholeheartedly:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>II Corinthians 5:17</b> - Therefore, <b>if</b> anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation. The old has passed away; behold, the new has come.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
A <b>new creation</b> has <span class="underline">faith working through love</span> and <span class="underline">keeps Jesus Christ's commandments</span>:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Galatians 6:15</b> - For neither <span class="underline">circumcision counts for anything, nor uncircumcision,</span> but <b>a new creation.</b> (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuQ_IhzVl1A">Steve Apirana - Born Again - YouTube</a></li>
</ul>

<p>
Out with the old selfish self and in with the new selflessly loving self:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Galatians 5:6</b> - For in Christ Jesus <span class="underline">neither circumcision nor uncircumcision counts for anything,</span> but only <b>faith working through love.</b> (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Out with the old selfish self and in with the new selflessly loving, and obedient to God self:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>I Corinthians 7:19</b> - For <span class="underline">neither circumcision counts for anything nor uncircumcision,</span> but <b>keeping the commandments of God.</b> (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
That's because God gives us a new spirit to obey Him:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Ezekiel 11:19-20</b> - And I will give them one heart, and a new spirit I will put within them. I will remove the heart of stone from their flesh and give them a heart of flesh, that they may walk in my statutes and keep my rules and obey them. And they shall be my people, and I will be their God. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
We receive the spirit by getting Jesus' words into us, believing them and obeying them. Feeding on them, we get Jesus' spirit and life into us:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>John 6:63</b> - It is the Spirit who gives life; the flesh is of no avail. The words that I have spoken to you are spirit and life. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
We can repent from sin as an act of obedient faith to God:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Jeremiah 4:4</b> - Circumcise yourselves to the LORD; remove the foreskin of your hearts, O men of Judah and inhabitants of Jerusalem; lest my wrath go forth like fire, and burn with none to quench it, because of the evil of your deeds. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-1">
<p>
What God does by way of initiative and what we do as a response is inextricably woven together [to the point where our obedience and God's work may be indistinguishable]. God turns our enmity to love and our disbelief to faith:
</p>

<p>
<a href="https://youtu.be/D70xSncZBDI?t=2052">Born Again - Alistair Begg, Parkside Church - YouTube</a>
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Philippians 2:13</b> - for it is <b>God who works in you, both to will and to work</b> for his good pleasure. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
<b>Paul toils</b>, <span class="underline">struggling with all God's energy</span> that <b>God works</b> powerfully within him:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Colossians 1:29</b> - For this <b>I toil, struggling</b> <span class="underline">with all</span> <b>his energy that he powerfully works within me.</b> (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Father God in Jesus was also doing His work through Jesus:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>John 14:10</b> - Do you not believe that I am in the Father, and the Father is in Me? The words that I say to you I do not speak on My own initiative, but the Father abiding in Me does His works. (NASB)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Here it is further echoed by Paul that though these people were acting of their own free will, they were doing God's will:
</p>

<p>
Paul commends <span class="underline">giving oneself to others by the will of God</span> (their will was doing God's will):
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>II Corinthians 8:3-5</b> - For they gave <i>according to their means</i>, as I can testify, and <i>beyond their means</i>, <b>of their own free will</b>, begging us earnestly for the favor of taking part in the relief of the saints— and this, not as we expected, but they <span class="underline">gave themselves first to the Lord</span> and <b>then by the will of God to us.</b> (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Paul commends both desiring to do the will of God, and then encourages to complete the work they desire to do, but says that <b>if the will (obedience of heart) is there, it is acceptable</b> according to what a person has:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>II Corinthians 8:10-12</b> - And in this matter I give my judgment: this benefits you, who a year ago started <span class="underline">not only to do this work</span> but <b>also to desire to do it</b>. So now <span class="underline">finish doing it as well</span>, so that your <b>readiness in desiring it may be matched by your completing it</b> out of what you have. For if the readiness is there, it is acceptable according to what a person has, not according to what he does not have. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
In "<a href="https://youtu.be/La7TpqSmuJk">The Blazing Center: Part 3 - YouTube</a>" John Piper says, "Maybe my will could correspond to God's will so I could do His will and it would be my will?!" I agree with him.
</p>

<p>
And through our obedience to Jesus we are saved. The Bible is clear - a works-based gospel based on God working through us saves:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Hebrews 5:8-9</b> - Although he was a son, he learned obedience through what he suffered. And being made perfect, he became the source of eternal salvation to all who obey him, (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
It's actually a faith-based gospel, and the works are a gift. So believing, obedient faith comes first and God works in us to change our heart to be transformed to love in the likeness of Jesus:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Ephesians 2:8-10</b> - For by grace you have been saved through faith. And this is not your own doing; it is the gift of God, not a result of works, so that no one may boast. For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God prepared beforehand, that we should walk in them. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Therefore, we teach people to both believe and to obey the Gospel. When we obey Jesus' commandments it's actually Jesus working in and through us. We want Jesus to be able to carry out work in us, so we obey Him - our will and God's will come into alignment when we obey Jesus' commandments.
</p>

<p>
Both belief and obedience are required of us, but the success of our work doesn't count for our righteousness, and believing is an initial act of obedience before continuing in the teaching of Christ. And the obedience is not burdensome:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>I John 5:3</b> - For this is the love of God, that we keep his commandments. And his commandments are not burdensome. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
As we go ahead, we <b>must</b> abide in the teaching of Christ, or we won't have God:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>II John 1:9</b> - Everyone who goes on ahead and does not abide in the teaching of Christ, does not have God. Whoever abides in the teaching has both the Father and the Son. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
We receive the spirit by getting Jesus' words into us, believing them and obeying them. Feeding on them, we get Jesus' spirit and life into us:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>John 6:63</b> - It is the Spirit who gives life; the flesh is of no avail. The words that I have spoken to you are spirit and life. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
We rest in believing what Jesus has accomplished on our behalf, but our heart should have become obedient to Jesus.
</p>

<p>
It's crucial to keep Jesus Christ's commandments:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>I John 3:20-24</b> - for whenever our heart condemns us, God is greater than our heart, and he knows everything. Beloved, if our heart does not condemn us, we have confidence before God; and whatever we ask we receive from him, because we keep his commandments and do what pleases him. And this is his commandment, that we believe in the name of his Son Jesus Christ and love one another, just as he has commanded us. Whoever keeps his commandments abides in him, and he in them. And by this we know that he abides in us, by the Spirit whom he has given us. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Work flowing from obedience is still totally by grace because we needed Jesus to obey God perfectly first! We must still obey Jesus.
</p>

<p>
Believing in Jesus should result in continued loving obedience to Jesus (following Jesus), and doing the work which is similar to the work that Jesus did:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>John 14:12</b> - Truly, truly, I say to you, whoever believes in me will also do the works that I do; and greater works than these will he do, because I am going to the Father. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
I think works that we can expect to come from believers in Jesus are:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>helping to bring about the obedience of faith</li>
<li>loving selflessly while not breaking faith with God</li>
</ul>

God's commandments are not too difficult to follow.
</p>

<p>
Love the LORD your God:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Deuteronomy 30:10-11</b> - when you obey the voice of the LORD your God, to keep his commandments and his statutes that are written in this Book of the Law, when you turn to the LORD your God with all your heart and with all your soul. For this commandment that I command you today is not too hard for you, neither is it far off. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Serve God:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Joshua 22:5</b> - Only be very careful to observe the commandment and the law that Moses the servant of the LORD commanded you, to love the LORD your God, and to walk in all his ways and to keep his commandments and to cling to him and to serve him with all your heart and with all your soul. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Love God so that we may live:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Deuteronomy 30:6</b> - And the LORD your God will circumcise your heart and the heart of your offspring, so that you will love the LORD your God with all your heart and with all your soul, that you may live. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Love your neighbour as yourself:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Leviticus 19:18</b> - You shall not take vengeance or bear a grudge against the sons of your own people, but you shall love your neighbor as yourself: I am the LORD. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Jesus' commandments us to even love one another, anyone around you, with selfless love:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>John 13:34-35</b> - A new commandment I give to you, that you love one another: just as I have loved you, you also are to love one another. By this all people will know that you are my disciples, if you have love for one another. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
And the Apostle John echos that the commandment is still extremely important:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>II John 1:5-6</b> - And now I ask you, dear lady—not as though I were writing you a new commandment, but the one we have had from the beginning—that we love one another. And this is love, that we walk according to his commandments; this is the commandment, just as you have heard from the beginning, so that you should walk in it. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Loving our neighbour as ourself should look like showing merciful love to those around you:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Luke 10:29-37</b> - But he, desiring to justify himself, said to Jesus, And who is my neighbor? Jesus replied, A man was going down from Jerusalem to Jericho, and he fell among robbers, who stripped him and beat him and departed, leaving him half dead. Now by chance a priest was going down that road, and when he saw him he passed by on the other side. So likewise a Levite, when he came to the place and saw him, passed by on the other side. But a Samaritan, as he journeyed, came to where he was, and when he saw him, he had compassion. He went to him and bound up his wounds, pouring on oil and wine. Then he set him on his own animal and brought him to an inn and took care of him. And the next day he took out two denarii and gave them to the innkeeper, saying, Take care of him, and whatever more you spend, I will repay you when I come back. <span class="underline">Which of these three, do you think,</span> <b>proved to be a neighbor</b> <span class="underline">to the man who fell among the robbers?</span> He said, <span class="underline">The one who showed him mercy.</span> And Jesus said to him, You go, and <b>do likewise.</b> (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Mark 12:30-31</b> - And you shall love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind and with all your strength. The second is this: You shall love your neighbor as yourself. There is no other commandment greater than these. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Mark 12:32-34</b> - And the scribe said to him, You are right, Teacher. You have truly said that he is one, and there is no other besides him. And to love him with all the heart and with all the understanding and with all the strength, and to love one's neighbor as oneself, is much more than all whole burnt offerings and sacrifices. And when Jesus saw that he answered wisely, he said to him, You are not far from the kingdom of God. And after that no one dared to ask him any more questions. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
We are supposed to fulfill the royal law:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>James 2:8-9</b> - If you really fulfill the royal law according to the Scripture, You shall love your neighbor as yourself, you are doing well. But if you show partiality, you are committing sin and are convicted by the law as transgressors. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The same way that Jesus loved, selflessly:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Galatians 6:2</b> - Bear one another's burdens, and so fulfill the law of Christ. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
We should aim to fulfill these great commandments while being merciful:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>James 2:11-13</b> - For he who said, Do not commit adultery, also said, Do not murder. If you do not commit adultery but do murder, you have become a transgressor of the law. So speak and so act as those who are to be judged under the law of liberty. For judgment is without mercy to one who has shown no mercy. Mercy triumphs over judgment. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
It's <span class="underline">perfect</span> obedience which only Jesus Christ managed to reach:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Philippians 2:8</b> - And being found in human form, he humbled himself by becoming obedient to the point of death, even death on a cross. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
We come to having obedient faith in God through obedient faith in Jesus Christ.
</p>

<p>
Jesus Christ obeyed Father God perfectly, and sinners put Him to death, and He became the source of eternal salvation to all those who obey Him:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Hebrews 5:8-9</b> - Although he was a son, he learned obedience through what he suffered. And being made perfect, he became the source of eternal salvation to all who obey him, (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>John 1:29</b> - The next day he saw Jesus coming toward him, and said, Behold, the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world! (ESV)

<p>
Just because we're gifted repentance to life, that doesn't mean that to go ahead and obediently repent makes the gift of repentance no longer a gift!
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Acts 11:18</b> - When they heard these things they fell silent. And they glorified God, saying, Then to the Gentiles also God has granted repentance that leads to life.

We believe on Jesus Christ and receive eternal life, and we are saved through Jesus Christ. We see that Jesus Christ obeyed God perfectly and He is the light. We have our hope on Jesus to save us when we believe on Him. We should trust Jesus enough to obey His commandments when we are presented with opportunities to glorify God with our actions. God works through us as we obey Jesus.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>John 3:16-19</b> - For God so loved the world, that he gave his only Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life. For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but in order that the world might be saved through him. Whoever believes in him is not condemned, but whoever does not believe is condemned already, because he has not believed in the name of the only Son of God. And this is the judgment: the light has come into the world, and people loved the darkness rather than the light because their deeds were evil. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
We must hear the words of God. If we hear them then we are of God.
I know I hear them.
If we keep Jesus' word (obey Jesus) we will not see death:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>John 8:47</b> - Whoever is of God hears the words of God. The reason why you do not hear them is that you are not of God. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>John 8:51</b> - Truly, truly, I say to you, if anyone keeps my word, he will never see death. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
To <b>keep Jesus' word</b> means to hear them and to obey:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Proverbs 7:1-3</b> - My son, <b>keep my words</b> and treasure up my commandments with you; <b>keep my commandments</b> and live; keep my teaching as the apple of your eye; bind them on your fingers; write them on the tablet of your heart. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Keeping means, not only <span class="underline">having</span> them but also <b>keeping</b>, <b>obeying</b> them:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>John 14:21-24</b> - Whoever <b>has my commandments and keeps them</b>, he it is who loves me. And he who loves me will be loved by my Father, and I will love him and manifest myself to him. Judas (not Iscariot) said to him, Lord, how is it that you will manifest yourself to us, and not to the world? Jesus answered him, If anyone loves me, he will keep my word, and my Father will love him, and we will come to him and make our home with him. Whoever does not love me does not keep my words. And the word that you hear is not mine but the Father's who sent me. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>I John 5:3</b> - For this is the love of God, that we keep his commandments. And his commandments are not burdensome.
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>John 8:55</b> - But you have not known him. I know him. If I were to say that I do not know him, I would be a liar like you, but I do know him and I keep his word. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
We are not condemned if we believe in the name of Jesus Christ, the only Son of God. That's really good news!:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>John 3:18</b> - <b>Whoever believes in him is not condemned</b>, but whoever does not believe is condemned already, because he has not believed in the name of the only Son of God. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
AMEN!!
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>John 5:24</b> - Truly, truly, I say to you, whoever hears my word and believes him who sent me has eternal life. He does not come into judgment, but has passed from death to life. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
AMEN!!
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>II Timothy 2:11</b> - The saying is trustworthy, for: If we have died with him, we will also live with him; (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Justification comes through through the righteousness of living by faith:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Habakkuk 2:4</b> - Behold, his soul is puffed up; it is not upright within him, but the righteous shall live by his faith. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Even the new believer is not condemned:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>I Corinthians 3:1</b> - But I, brothers, could not address you as spiritual people, but as people of the flesh, as infants in Christ. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
And as we know, no-one in Christ is condemned:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Romans 8:1</b> - There is therefore now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus.

I have been just trying to figure out my theology. One God, three persons, Father, Son and Holy Spirit. I don't have the say though. God puts a person in. AMEN!!
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>I Corinthians 1:30</b> - But <b>by His doing you are in Christ Jesus,</b> who became to us wisdom from God, and righteousness and sanctification, and redemption, (NASB)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
We must drop the old selfish self and allow Jesus to come in with the new obediently loving self:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Psalms 37:27</b> - Turn away from evil and do good; so shall you dwell forever. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Selfish people killed Jesus. Jesus was selfless. Jesus was obedient to God unto death. We identify with Christ with a death like His, to be united with Him in a resurrection like His! This is why obedience to Jesus is so important. How can a person be resurrected if they don't die? We need to die a death to be resurrected:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>II Timothy 2:11</b> - The saying is trustworthy, for: If we have died with him, we will also live with him; (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Romans 6:1</b> - What shall we say then? Are we to continue in sin that grace may abound? By no means! How can we who died to sin still live in it? Do you not know that all of us who have been baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into his death? We were buried therefore with him by baptism into death, in order that, just as Christ was raised from the dead by the glory of the Father, we too might walk in newness of life. For <b>if we have been united with him in a death like his, we shall certainly be united with him in a resurrection like his</b>. We know that our old self was crucified with him in order that the body of sin might be brought to nothing, so that we would no longer be enslaved to sin. For one who has died has been set free from sin. Now if we have died with Christ, we believe that we will also live with him. We know that Christ being raised from the dead will never die again; death no longer has dominion over him. For the death he died he died to sin, once for all, but <b>the life he lives he lives to God.</b> So you also must consider yourselves dead to sin and alive to God in Christ Jesus.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Nevertheless the one who trusts in Jesus and dies will yet live. AMEN!! And the following verse, I believe actually applies to baptism (identifying with Christ in His death and resurrection)! So a nice way of reading the following is: If someone, while believing in Jesus Christ, dies to their old selfish nature to live as someone who loves selflessly, they will live, and the one who lives abiding in Jesus Christ's love, having died to their old selfish nature, and believes in Him will never die:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>John 11:25-26</b> - Jesus said to her, I am the resurrection and the life. Whoever believes in me, though he die, yet shall he live, and everyone who lives and believes in me shall never die. Do you believe this?
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
I like that way of thinking of it because it encapsulates both belief and obedience to Jesus - both which I think are important.
</p>

<p>
Jesus' selfless love also faithful to God. <b>Without breaking faith with God</b>, Jesus loved back his persecutors:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Hebrews 5:8-9</b> - Although he was a son, he learned obedience through what he suffered. And being made perfect, he became the source of eternal salvation to all who obey him, (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
To put it another way, while needing to fulfill the law and the prophets, he did not sin, and sinners took his life and even his clothes:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>I Peter 2:22</b> - He committed no sin, neither was deceit found in his mouth. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Matthew 27:35</b> - And when they had crucified him, they divided his garments among them by casting lots. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>I Peter 3:17-18</b> - For it is better to suffer for doing good, if that should be God's will, than for doing evil. For Christ also suffered once for sins, the righteous for the unrighteous, that he might bring us to God, being put to death in the flesh but made alive in the spirit, (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
And Jesus prayed for his persecutors:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Luke 23:34</b> - And Jesus said, Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do. And they cast lots to divide his garments. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Likewise, that's the type of selfless love we should have. Selfless love while trying to maintain faithfulness to God:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>I Peter 2:20</b> - For what credit is it if, when you sin and are beaten for it, you endure? But if when you do good and suffer for it you endure, this is a gracious thing in the sight of God. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>I Peter 4:19</b> - Therefore let those who suffer according to God's will entrust their souls to a faithful Creator while doing good. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The purest selfless love loves while not breaking faith with God. Jesus maintained faithfulness to God while maintaining selfless love. We should endeavour to have the same mind:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Philippians 2:5-8</b> - Have this mind among yourselves, which is yours in Christ Jesus, who, though he was in the form of God, did not count equality with God a thing to be grasped, but made himself nothing, taking the form of a servant, being born in the likeness of men. And being found in human form, he humbled himself by becoming obedient to the point of death, even death on a cross. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
We are commanded to be innocent, and to bear witness of Jesus before men who persecute us:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Matthew 10:16-18</b> - Behold, I am sending you out as <b>sheep in the midst of wolves</b>, so be wise as serpents and <b>innocent as doves</b>. Beware of men, for they will deliver you over to courts and flog you in their synagogues, and you will be dragged before governors and kings for my sake, to bear witness before them and the Gentiles. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Philippians 2:15-16</b> - that you may be blameless and innocent, children of God without blemish in the midst of a crooked and twisted generation, among whom you shine as lights in the world, holding fast to the word of life, so that in the day of Christ I may be proud that I did not run in vain or labor in vain. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
I conjecture that, effectively, <code>Obedience = Believing the gospel, and Selfless love</code> (no longer serving yourself but serving Christ. It's obeying Jesus.).
</p>

<p>
Nevertheless, <a href="https://youtu.be/tqtl-sXeTmA?t=1459">where we fall short of obedience, Jesus has us covered</a>. But if we are keeping Jesus' commandments then we're abiding in His love.
</p>

<p>
Is it crucial to obey the gospel? Yes. Is that a 'works-based' gospel? If we must put a label on it, I'd describe it more of a <b>my-willingness-to-work-serving-Christ-based-on-Jesus'-finished-works-and-God-working-in-me-based</b> gospel.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
God works in us to save us. Since obedience to God is faith, God works in us through faith:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Philippians 1:6</b> - And I am sure of this, that he who began a good work in you will bring it to completion at the day of Jesus Christ. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Jude 1:21</b> - keep yourselves in the love of God, waiting for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ that leads to eternal life. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Although, we will arrive at rest:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Heb 4:1-6</b> - Therefore, while the promise of entering his rest still stands, let us fear lest any of you should seem to have failed to reach it. For good news came to us just as to them, but the message they heard did not benefit them, because they were not united by faith with those who listened. For we who have believed enter that rest, as he has said, As I swore in my wrath, They shall not enter my rest, although his works were finished from the foundation of the world. For he has somewhere spoken of the seventh day in this way: And God rested on the seventh day from all his works. And again in this passage he said, They shall not enter my rest. Since therefore it remains for some to enter it, and those who formerly received the good news failed to enter because of disobedience,
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Heb 4:9-11</b> - So then, there remains a Sabbath rest for the people of God, for whoever has entered God's rest has also rested from his works as God did from his. Let us therefore strive to enter that rest, so that no one may fall by the same sort of disobedience.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
We work then find rest:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Revelation of John 14:13</b> - And I heard a voice from heaven saying, Write this: Blessed are the dead who die in the Lord from now on. Blessed indeed, says the Spirit, that they may rest from their labors, for their deeds follow them! (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
That rest looks like living for the will of God:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>I Peter 4:1-2</b> - Since therefore Christ suffered in the flesh, arm yourselves with the same way of thinking, for whoever has suffered in the flesh has ceased from sin, so as to live for the rest of the time in the flesh no longer for human passions but for the will of God. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
So it's still extremely important for us to try to keep His commandments, and His commandments are to love God and one another as He loved us, selflessly.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Ephesians 2:8-9</b> - For <b>by grace you have been saved through faith.</b> And this is not your own doing; it is the gift of God, not a result of works, so that no one may boast. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
And I wont stop following Jesus Christ until I know Him as personally as possible - I want His thoughts running through my mind like Father God's thoughts ran through His. Anything less than that and I am unsatisfied.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>I Corinthians 2:11-16</b> - For who knows a person's thoughts except the spirit of that person, which is in him? So also no one comprehends the thoughts of God except the Spirit of God. Now we have received not the spirit of the world, but the Spirit who is from God, that we might understand the things freely given us by God. And we impart this in words not taught by human wisdom but taught by the Spirit, interpreting spiritual truths to those who are spiritual. The natural person does not accept the things of the Spirit of God, for they are folly to him, and he is not able to understand them because they are spiritually discerned. The spiritual person judges all things, but is himself to be judged by no one. For who has understood the mind of the Lord so as to instruct him? But we have the mind of Christ. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Jesus knows us and we know Jesus:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>John 10:14</b> - I am the good shepherd. I know my own and my own know me, (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
We must be keeping Jesus' commandments for us to be sure that we have come to know Him:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>I John 2:3-4</b> - And by this we know that we have come to know him, if we keep his commandments. Whoever says I know him but does not keep his commandments is a liar, and the truth is not in him,
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Jesus commands us to take His yoke (obey Him) and learn from Him (believe Him):
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Matthew 11:29</b> - Take my yoke upon you, and learn from me, for I am gentle and lowly in heart, and you will find rest for your souls. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
So receive the words of Jesus and the Apostles to know the thoughts of God inside your own mind:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>I Corinthians 2:11-14</b> - For <span class="underline">who knows a person's thoughts except the spirit of that person,</span> which is in him? So also <span class="underline">no one comprehends the thoughts of God except the Spirit of God.</span> Now <b>we have received not the spirit of the world, but the Spirit who is from God, that we might understand the things freely given us by God.</b> And <span class="underline">we impart this in words not taught by human wisdom but taught by the Spirit, interpreting spiritual truths to those who are spiritual.</span> The natural person does not accept the things of the Spirit of God, for they are folly to him, and he is not able to understand them because they are spiritually discerned. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
We need to perform our salvation in obedience to God:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Philippians 2:12</b> - Therefore, my beloved, as you have <b>always obeyed</b>, so now, not only as in my presence but much more in my absence, work out (<b>katergazomai</b>) your own salvation with fear and trembling, (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Let's see what the word <b>katergazomai</b> (the word for 'work out') means:

<p>
So I think trusting Jesus, obeying Jesus and believing Jesus' words, and believing in Him should be <b>true simultaneously</b>, because people misconstrue Jesus' words to their own destruction.
</p>

<p>
When we are believing in Jesus Christ's finished work and obeying Jesus, obeying His commandments, it is actually God who is working in us:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Philippians 2:13</b> - for it is <b>God who works in you, both to will and to work</b> for his good pleasure. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
We serve Christ:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Matthew 25:40</b> - And the King will answer them, Truly, I say to you, as you did it to one of the least of these my brothers, you did it to me. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Mark 9:37</b> - Whoever receives one such child in my name receives me, and whoever receives me, receives not me but him who sent me. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
If a person serves Christ, this is not a dead works-based gospel, but is simply obeying the gospel. That person has been brought into obedience by the grace of God.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>II Peter 3:14-18</b> - Therefore, beloved, since you are waiting for these, be diligent to be found by him without spot or blemish, and at peace. And count the patience of our Lord as salvation, just as our beloved brother Paul also wrote to you according to the wisdom given him, as he does in all his letters when he speaks in them of these matters. There are some things in them that are hard to understand, which the ignorant and unstable twist to their own destruction, as they do the other Scriptures. You therefore, beloved, knowing this beforehand, take care that you are not carried away with the error of lawless people and lose your own stability. But grow in the grace and knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. To him be the glory both now and to the day of eternity. Amen.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
We are supposed to then proclaim the excellencies of Him who has called us out of darkness into His marvelous light:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>I Peter 2:9</b> - But you are a chosen race, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people for his own possession, that you may <span class="underline">proclaim the excellencies of him who called you out of darkness into his marvelous light.</span> (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
God is amazing. Because He made me born-again
so I could come into a relationship with Him
where I can truthfully say that I was stuck in
my sin and God broke that sin off me through
making me born-again, and has given me a new
Spirit so I can walk in obedience to Him.
</p>

<p>
It's only possible through what Jesus Christ
has achieved for us on the cross.
</p>

<li><a href="https://youtu.be/IkHgxKemCRk?list=RDf2oxGYpuLkw&amp;t=94">Chris Tomlin - Holy Forever {Lyric Video} - YouTube</a></li>
</ul>

<p>
Even having faith in God through faith in Jesus is obedience according to <code>Romans 16:26</code>. <b>If a person is trusting in Him when they die, they will live.</b>
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Romans 16:26</b> - but has now been disclosed and through the prophetic writings has been made known to all nations, according to <span class="underline">the command of the eternal God</span>, to bring about the <b>obedience of faith</b> — (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Therefore, I assert that there's no <b>eternal</b> security for those who are not willing to obey Jesus, or to turn away from their sin.
Our obedience is penitent, not perfect.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Hebrews 5:9</b> - And being made perfect, he became the source of eternal salvation to <span class="underline">all who obey him,</span>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Also I conclude that obeying Jesus Christ is having faith in Him.
</p>

<p>
Why then do people preach to stop 'working for God'? The problem isn't work, but that work not done in faith is sin.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>I Thessalonians 5:12-14</b> - We ask you, brothers, to respect those who labor among you and are over you in the Lord and admonish you, and to esteem them very highly in love because of their work. Be at peace among yourselves. And we urge you, brothers, admonish the idle, encourage the fainthearted, help the weak, be patient with them all. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Work being done by God in us to sanctify us and bring us everlasting life <b>is</b> work done in faith.
So the problem isn't work (even work relating to salvation) but the problem is work that is not done in faith (i.e. dead work).
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
I believe that anyone who trusts (is trusting) in the Lord Jesus Christ for their salvation, even they have no works, but only a trusting heart, believing what Jesus said, and putting their hope in Jesus for their salvation, <span class="underline">repentant and willing to obey (obedient),</span> theoretically are to be in Christ if God does it. I consider that obedience to Jesus and turning away from sin is essential to be found in Him. If someone dies while trusting in Him they will live. If someone trusts in Him while they live they will never die.

<p>
At the stage they trust in Jesus, they may have no work but I believe at that stage they are justified, when in their heart is obedient, trusting, believing faith in Christ who is their life. But I'm not the one to justify them, God is.
And I assume that Jesus knows who those people are - He knows that they are His sheep, and that Father God draws those people to Him.
And when they go through Jesus Christ, the door, they are saved.
</p>

<p>
I believe that if a person trusts and believe on God in their heart, believing that they need saving and that Jesus Christ is their Lord and that Jesus Christ died for their transgressions and was raised for their justification - that they have a hearing heart and a <span class="underline">heart that follows Him</span> - that they will be saved.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
I simply see no enmity between trusting God for justification through the finished work of the cross by Jesus Christ and trusting God by obeying Jesus Christ. I believe that is a false dichotomy.

<i><b>1. A change of heart towards humility, fear of God, belief and trust in Jesus to be saved, an awareness of one's own sin and the reality of judgement, and acknowledging Jesus' Lordship and deity:</b></i>
</p>

<p>
All the thief could do was look to Jesus and cry out for mercy but thankfully that is all he needed. This was all that was required of him for salvation and the same is true for us.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
The thief didn't get to go learn the bible, or get baptised or begin to follow Jesus in the way that he lived, but that is not to say that those things are not important because they are.
Those are things that God has commanded us to do, and if we love God then we should want to be obedient in doing those things. The distiction is that those things don't earn our salvation but they are the
fruit of a heart that has truly put faith in Jesus. I think that the thief would have gone on to do those things, he just never had a chance. But you might be thinking: I don't always obey Jesus.
I still wrestle with sin and the answer is that you won't perfectly obey Jesus. You will still have sin in your life because Jesus will be continuing to work that out in you until the day that you die.
But if you desire to know the God of the Bible and to love God and to obey God's word, that in itself is evidence that God is at work in your heart because we cannot do those things on our own.
Even if we aren't yet fully where we know we ought to be with those things, the fact that they're there is an indication and that we are continuing to grow in grace.
</p>

<p>
Both robbers start off mocking Jesus but then one of the robbers has a change of heart:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Matthew 27:43-44</b> - He trusts in God; let God deliver him now, if he desires him. For he said, I am the Son of God. And the robbers who were crucified with him also reviled him in the same way. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Mark 15:32</b> - Let the Christ, the King of Israel, come down now from the cross that we may see and believe. Those who were crucified with him also reviled him. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Luke 23:39-43</b> - One of the criminals who were hanged railed at him, saying, Are you not the Christ? Save yourself and us! But the other rebuked him, saying, Do you not fear God, since you are under the same sentence of condemnation? And we indeed justly, for we are receiving the due reward of our deeds; but this man has done nothing wrong. And he said, Jesus, remember me when you come into your kingdom. And he said to him, Truly, I say to you, today you will be with me in Paradise. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
<i><b>2. We must have a hatred of one's own sin:</b></i>
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
To be a Christian doesn't mean that we are without sin this side of heaven, but it does mean that we have a hatred for our own sin, that we are wrestling with the flesh that is still inside us even as Jesus is making us new, rather than being complacent over our sin.
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Romans 7:19-20</b> - For I do not do the good I want, but the evil I do not want is what I keep on doing. Now if I do what I do not want, it is no longer I who do it, but sin that dwells within me. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
It's really important to turn from sin:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>I John 3:5-6</b> - You know that he appeared to take away sins, and in him there is no sin. No one who abides in him keeps on sinning; no one who keeps on sinning has either seen him or known him.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
We endeavour to be justified through faithful obedience to Jesus, and if we fall short, we still believe Christ has us covered. But we do endeavour, we do try:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Galatians 2:17</b> - But if, in our endeavor to be justified in Christ, we too were found to be sinners, is Christ then a servant of sin? Certainly not! (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
<i><b>3. Our faith has been tested, and results in praise and glory and honour at the revelation of Jesus Christ:</b></i>
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>I Peter 1:6-7</b> - In this you rejoice, though now for a little while, if necessary, you have been grieved by various trials, so that the tested genuineness of your faith—more precious than gold that perishes though it is tested by fire—may be found to result in praise and glory and honor at the revelation of Jesus Christ. (ESV)

I believe the above prophetically talks about Jesus. We must obey Jesus. God doesn't guarantee that following Jesus will be easy.

Obedience to Jesus' commandments (repentance from sin):
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Luke 24:46-47</b> - and said to them, Thus it is written, that the Christ should suffer and on the third day rise from the dead, and that <b>repentance</b> (G3341 metanoia) and <b>forgiveness</b> (G859 aphesis) of sins should be proclaimed in his name to all nations, beginning from Jerusalem.

Obedience to Jesus' commandments (becoming disciples, obeying Jesus' commandments):

<p>
Obedience to Jesus' commandments (trusting Jesus and being baptised):
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Mark 16:15-18</b> - And he said to them, Go into all the world and proclaim the gospel to the whole creation. Whoever believes and is baptized will be saved, but whoever does not believe will be condemned. And these signs will accompany those who believe: in my name they will cast out demons; they will speak in new tongues; they will pick up serpents with their hands; and if they drink any deadly poison, it will not hurt them; they will lay their hands on the sick, and they will recover.

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>John 21:15-17</b> - When they had finished breakfast, Jesus said to Simon Peter, Simon, son of John, do you love me more than these? He said to him, Yes, Lord; you know that I love you.

<p>
The original Apostles were instructed to feed Jesus' sheep with the living bread that is Jesus Christ. Likewise, in living testimony we should teach others to walk the way of righteousness:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>John 6:33</b> - For the bread of God is he who comes down from heaven and gives life to the world.
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>II Timothy 2:24-26</b> - And the Lord's servant must not be quarrelsome but kind to everyone, able to teach, patiently enduring evil, correcting his opponents with gentleness. God may perhaps grant them repentance leading to a knowledge of the truth, and they may escape from the snare of the devil, after being captured by him to do his will. (ESV)

<p>
Yes, I believe that Jesus can save a person who believes in His name. But He is the judge, and it is written in John's gospel that no person who remains disobedient to Jesus Christ will see life, and I believe that.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Revelation of John 3:8</b> - I know your works. Behold, I have set before you an open door, which no one is able to shut. I know that <span class="underline">you have but little power, and yet you have kept my word and have not denied my name.</span>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
I think Jesus calls us to pursue perfection through following Him, and we should definitely give it a go:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>John 17:23</b> - I in them and you in me, that <span class="underline">they may become perfectly one,</span> so that the world may know that you sent me and loved them even as you loved me.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
We aim for perfection / to be made complete / full restoration:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>II Corinthians 13:11</b> - Finally, brethren, farewell. <b>Be perfect</b>, be of good comfort, be of one mind, live in peace; and the God of love and peace shall be with you. (KJV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>II Corinthians 13:11-14</b> - Finally, brethren, rejoice, <b>be made complete</b>, be comforted, be like-minded, live in peace; and the God of love and peace will be with you. Greet one another with a holy kiss. All the saints greet you. The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the fellowship of <b>the Holy Spirit</b>, be with you all. (NASB)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Paul presses on to try to live like Christ, and his rational is that Jesus made him (Paul) his own (i.e. Jesus loved him),
and Paul loves Jesus back, so he wants to be obedient out of love for Jesus (I'm convinced that's the motivation). He wants to be with Jesus.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Philippians 3:9-12</b> - and be found in him, not having a righteousness of my own that comes from the law, but <span class="underline">that which comes through faith in Christ, the righteousness from God that depends on faith</span> — that <span class="underline">I may know him and the power of his resurrection, and may share his sufferings, becoming like him in his death,</span> <span class="underline">that by any means possible I may attain the resurrection from the dead.</span> <span class="underline">Not that I have already obtained this or am already perfect, but I press on to make it my own,</span> because Christ Jesus has made me his own.

Jesus' teaching is extremely important for Christians to abide in. Jesus' teaching comes from the same God, Jehovah:

<b>John 7:16</b> - So Jesus answered them, My teaching is not mine, but his who sent me. (ESV)
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Deuteronomy 30:19-20</b> - I call heaven and earth to witness against you today, that I have set before you life and death, blessing and curse. Therefore choose life, that you and your offspring may live, loving the LORD your God, obeying his voice and holding fast to him, for he is your life and length of days, that you may dwell in the land that the LORD swore to your fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, to give them. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>II John 1:9</b> - Everyone who goes on ahead and does not abide in the teaching of Christ, does not have God. Whoever abides in the teaching has both the Father and the Son. (ESV)

</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>I Timothy 6:3</b> - If anyone teaches a different doctrine and does not agree with the sound words of our Lord Jesus Christ and the teaching that accords with godliness, (ESV)

</blockquote>

<p>
I'm pretty convinced that what Jesus means by the following is that by giving up worldly treasure in the pursuit
of Jesus, heavenly treasure is acquired. I'd say it's likely that the heavenly treasure is simply helping those people.
Selling what a person possesses and giving to the poor is actually serving Jesus, so doing that is already starting to obediently follow Jesus.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Matthew 19:21</b> - Jesus said to him, If you would be perfect, go, sell what you possess and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; and come, follow me.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Jesus' perfect example of patience in mercy towards Paul is to:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>reassure us that we can trust Jesus as we hope for the promise of eternal life to be received from Him,</li>
<li>for us to see that trusting in Him, we are loved by God and led by His love, following Him in patient [endurance] out of a response of love for Him, trusting in Him, as we receive mercy from Him</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>I Timothy 1:16</b> - But I received mercy for this reason, that in me, as the foremost, Jesus Christ might display his perfect patience as an example to those who were to believe in him for eternal life. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
We are set free from sin to become slaves of God. The fruit of being a slave to God leads to sanctification and at its end, eternal life:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Romans 6:22-23</b> - But now that you have been set free from sin and have become slaves of God, the fruit you get leads to sanctification and its end, eternal life. For the wages of sin is death, but the free gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
<b>Romans 6:7</b> - For one who has died has been set free from sin. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
You are not your own:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>I Corinthians 6:17-20</b> - But he who is joined to the Lord becomes one spirit with him. Flee from sexual immorality. Every other sin a person commits is outside the body, but the sexually immoral person sins against his own body. Or do you not know that your body is a temple of <b>the Holy Spirit</b> within you, whom you have from God? <b>You are not your own,</b> for you were bought with a price. So glorify God in your body. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
We must keep ourselves in the love of God by obeying Jesus Christ's commandments, because we're awaiting to receive eternal life:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Jude 1:21</b> - <b>keep yourselves in the love of God,</b> waiting for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ that leads to eternal life. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Keeping Jesus Christ's commandments is a requirement to inherit eternal life:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>John 15:10</b> - <b>If you keep my commandments, you will abide in my love,</b> just as I have kept my Father's commandments and abide in his love. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Whoever truly believes Jesus trusts in and is obedient to Jesus. We must obey Jesus Christ, and that obedience means being a slave of righteousness, leading to sanctification, which leads to eternal life:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>John 3:36</b> - Whoever believes in the Son has eternal life; whoever does not obey the Son shall not see life, but the wrath of God remains on him. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
I think believing in the Son is also obedience, but it is an act of obedience which is a gift to us.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Ephesians 2:8</b> - For by grace you have been saved through faith. And this is not your own doing; it is the gift of God, (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>John 6:68</b> - Simon Peter answered him, Lord, to whom shall we go? You have the words of eternal life, (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Romans 10:17</b> - So faith comes from hearing, and hearing through the word of Christ. (ESV)
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>John 4:14</b> - but whoever drinks of the water that I will give him will never be thirsty forever. The water that I will give him will become in him a spring of water welling up to eternal life. (ESV)

<p>
The word for 'believe' which is used in the New Testament is the verb for faith and actually means to 'trust':

<blockquote>
<p>
The ancient Greek word for “believe” is
<a href="https://biblehub.com/greek/4100.htm"><i>pisteuó</i></a>, which derives from
“belief” or “<a href="https://biblehub.com/greek/4102.htm"><i>pistis</i></a>.” The
word “/pistis/” stems from
<a href="https://biblehub.com/greek/3982.htm"><i>peíthō</i></a>, to persuade or be
persuaded.

<p>
The Greek word <i>pisteuó</i> carries connotations of deep trust and
confidence. It means to believe, to entrust, to have confidence in
something.

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-4-4-1">
<p>
Obedience to God is faith. Abraham went to live in the land of promise by <b>obedience</b>:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Genesis 12:1-8</b> - Now <b>the LORD said to Abram, Go from your country and your kindred and your father's house to the land that I will show you. And I will make of you a great nation,</b> and I will bless you and make your name great, so that you will be a blessing. I will bless those who bless you, and him who dishonors you I will curse, and in you all the families of the earth shall be blessed. <b>So Abram went, as the LORD had told him,</b> and Lot went with him. Abram was seventy-five years old when he departed from Haran. And Abram took Sarai his wife, and Lot his brother's son, and all their possessions that they had gathered, and the people that they had acquired in Haran, and they set out to go to the land of Canaan. <b>When they came to the land of Canaan,</b> Abram passed through the land to the place at Shechem, to the oak of Moreh. At that time the Canaanites were in the land. <b>Then the LORD appeared to Abram and said, To your offspring I will give this land. So he built there an altar to the LORD, who had appeared to him.</b> From there he moved to the hill country on the east of Bethel and pitched his tent, with Bethel on the west and Ai on the east. And there he built an altar to the LORD and called upon the name of the LORD. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
<code>Hebrews 11:9</code> says that Abraham went to live in the land of promise by <b>faith</b>:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Hebrews 11:9</b> - By faith he went to live in the land of promise, as in a foreign land, living in tents with Isaac and Jacob, heirs with him of the same promise. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
We hear the gospel, and we receive salvation through faith. Reaching it is a journey of applied faith:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Hebrews 4:1-2</b> - Therefore, while the promise of entering his rest still stands, let us fear lest any of you should seem to have failed to <span class="underline">reach it.</span> For good news came to us just as to them, but the message they heard did not benefit them, because they were not <span class="underline">united by faith</span> with those who listened. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The rest goes to the one who takes Jesus' yoke and learns from Him. Obedience to Jesus will result in finding rest for your soul:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Matthew 11:28-29</b> - Come to me, all who labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. <b>Take my yoke upon you</b>, and <b>learn from me</b>, for I am gentle and lowly in heart, <b>and you will find rest for your souls.</b> (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The rest goes to those who have believed. Believing in Jesus is obedience to the gospel:
</p>

<p>
<a href="https://biblehub.com/interlinear/hebrews/4-3.htm">Hebrews 4:3 Interlinear: for we do enter into the rest &#x2013; we who did believe, as He said, 'So I sware in My anger, If they shall enter into My rest &#x2013; ;' and yet the works were done from the foundation of the world,</a>
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Hebrews 4:3</b> - For we who have believed enter that rest, as he has said, As I swore in my wrath, They shall not enter my rest, although his works were finished from the foundation of the world.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
We work then find rest:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Revelation of John 14:13</b> - And I heard a voice from heaven saying, Write this: Blessed are the dead who die in the Lord from now on. Blessed indeed, says the Spirit, that they may rest from their labors, for their deeds follow them! (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
That rest looks like living for the will of God:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>I Peter 4:1-2</b> - Since therefore Christ suffered in the flesh, arm yourselves with the same way of thinking, for whoever has suffered in the flesh has ceased from sin, so as to live for the rest of the time in the flesh no longer for human passions but for the will of God. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The demons have belief, but they don't have a response of love towards God:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>James 2:19</b> - You believe that God is one; you do well. Even the demons believe—and shudder! (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
We must know that God loved us and sent his Son to be the propitiation for our sins. We must believe:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>I John 4:10</b> - In <b>this is love</b>, <span class="underline">not that we have loved God but that he loved us and sent his Son to be the propitiation for our sins.</span>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
We must obey:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>II John 1:5-6</b> - And now I ask you, dear lady—not as though I were writing you a new commandment, but the one we have had from the beginning—that <span class="underline">we love one another</span>. And <b>this is love</b>, that <span class="underline">we walk according to his commandments</span>; this is the commandment, just as you have heard from the beginning, so that you should walk in it. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
We must obey Jesus and love one another:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>I Corinthians 16:22</b> - If anyone has no love for the Lord, let him be accursed. Our Lord, come! (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The knowledge comes from having obeyed God's voice. Love becomes perfected in us when we abide in God:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>I John 4:15-17</b> - Whoever confesses that Jesus is the Son of God, God abides in him, and he in God. So we have come to know and to believe the love that God has for us. God is love, and whoever abides in love abides in God, and God abides in him. By this is love perfected with us, so that we may have confidence for the day of judgment, because as he is so also are we in this world.
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>I John 2:4</b> - Whoever says I know him but does not keep his commandments is a liar, and the truth is not in him, (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>John 8:55</b> - But you have not known him. I know him. If I were to say that I do not know him, I would be a liar like you, but I do know him and I keep his word. (ESV)

<h4 id="org0a59d25"><span class="section-number-4">4.4.2.</span> Joy requires apostolic work</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-4-4-2">
<p>
I agree whole heartedly with John Piper here:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ltvYtwMef4">The Blazing Center by John Piper - YouTube</a></li>
</ul>

<p>
<i><b>Quote from John Piper:</b></i>
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
I'm dealing with the issue of God's
glory and our gladness. Can they really
be one? And I'm doing that under the
bigger banner of "How can I spread a
passion for the supremacy of God?" because
I think that phrase "passion for the
supremacy of God" pulls together the two
things:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li><span class="underline">"passion"</span> signifies <i>"I'm joyful"</i> and</li>
<li><span class="underline">"supremacy of God"</span> signifies <i>"he's being magnified"</i>.</li>
</ol>

<p>
So my biggest longing in
life is to be used by God to help people
see him for who he really is in his
magnificence, and then have emotions that
are appropriate to that magnificence. Why
do we watch the World Series? Why do we
watch gymnastics when the Olympics rolls
around? Why do we go to the Grand Canyon?
Why do we go to the Alps? Why do we go to
the ocean and look out over&#x2026; Why do we
want to get near bigness and beauty and
magnificence and excellence? It's because
that's what we were made for. We were not
made for mirrors. So I want to be
absolutely candid, <b>the Christian Life Is War</b> and I'm in the business of helping
people know how to fight in the way that
they're supposed to, namely for joy.
</p>

<p>
There's a text in <b>2 Corinthians 1:24</b>:
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>II Corinthians 1:24</b> - <span class="underline">Not that we lord it over your faith, but we work with you for your joy,</span> for you stand firm in your faith. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
I was amazed when I saw that.
Paul says "I'm a worker for your joy" as
though <b>Joy requires apostolic work, and
if it does for him it does for me.</b> And so
yeah there are times in the ministerial
life or the Christian Life when we're
low. It seems like all the joy is gone we
want to quit give up the ministry give
up the faith, and at those moments we
need to fight like heaven to hold on.

We are granted repentance to life; being a slave to righteousness leading to sanctification and at its end, eternal life. We expect to receive salvation as we have faith in Jesus Christ:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Romans 3:21-25</b> - But now the righteousness of God has been manifested apart from the law, although the Law and the Prophets bear witness to it— the righteousness of God through faith in Jesus Christ for all who believe. For there is no distinction: for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God, and are justified by his grace as a gift, through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus, whom God put forward as a propitiation by his blood, to be <b>received by faith</b>. This was to show God's righteousness, because in his divine forbearance he had passed over former sins.

For all who are led by the Spirit of God are sons of God. For you did not receive the spirit of slavery to fall back into fear, but you have received the Spirit of adoption as sons, by whom we cry, Abba! Father! The Spirit himself bears witness with our spirit that we are children of God, and if children, then heirs—heirs of God and fellow heirs with Christ, provided we suffer with him in order that we may also be glorified with him. For I consider that the sufferings of this present time are not worth comparing with the glory that is to be revealed to us. For the creation waits with eager longing for the revealing of the sons of God. For the creation was subjected to futility, not willingly, but because of him who subjected it, in hope that the creation itself will be set free from its bondage to decay and obtain the freedom of the glory of the children of God. For we know that the whole creation has been groaning together in the pains of childbirth until now. And not only the creation, but we ourselves, who have the firstfruits of the Spirit, groan inwardly as we wait eagerly for adoption as sons, the redemption of our bodies. For in this hope we were saved. Now hope that is seen is not hope. For who hopes for what he sees? But if we hope for what we do not see, we wait for it with patience.

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-4-6-4">
<p>
An heart of faith looks like:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Wanting to do God's will
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Obedience and repentance from sin: even if it just means <span class="underline">wanting to turn from sin</span></li>
<li>because God makes the new heart to enable the person to obey</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Wanting to follow Jesus</li>
<li>Accepting Jesus Christ as one's Lord</li>
<li>Accepting through faith the atonement for sin through Jesus Christ</li>
<li>Turning away from sin</li>
</ul>

<p>
Return to obedience to God through obedience to Jesus. Turn from sin:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Joel 2:12-13</b> - Yet even now, declares the LORD, return to me with all your heart, with fasting, with weeping, and with mourning; and rend your hearts and not your garments. Return to the LORD, your God, for he is gracious and merciful, slow to anger, and abounding in steadfast love; and he relents over disaster. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
God provides the new heart, and God works through us:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Ezekiel 11:19-20</b> - And I will give them one heart, and a new spirit I will put within them. I will remove the heart of stone from their flesh and give them a heart of flesh, that they may walk in my statutes and keep my rules and obey them. And they shall be my people, and I will be their God. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
So to be saved a person must have an obedient heart, prepared for the good works which are prepared for us to walk in:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Ephesians 2:8-10</b> - For <b>by grace you have been saved through faith.</b> And this is not your own doing; it is the gift of God, not a result of works, so that no one may boast. For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God prepared beforehand, that we should walk in them.

</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The tax collector here has an obedient heart (yielding to Jesus), but the Pharisee in the story has a self-righteous heart:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Luke 18:9-14</b> - He also told this parable to some who trusted in themselves that they were righteous, and treated others with contempt: Two men went up into the temple to pray, one a Pharisee and the other a tax collector. The Pharisee, standing by himself, prayed thus: God, I thank you that I am not like other men, extortioners, unjust, adulterers, or even like this tax collector. I fast twice a week; I give tithes of all that I get. <span class="underline">But the tax collector, standing far off, would not even lift up his eyes to heaven, but beat his breast, saying, God, be merciful to me, a sinner! I tell you, this man went down to his house justified, rather than the other.</span> For everyone who exalts himself will be humbled, but the one who humbles himself will be exalted.his house justified, rather than the other._ For everyone who exalts himself will be humbled, but the one who humbles himself will be exalted.

<p>
It's those that believe in him (trust Him, receive Him, <span class="underline">expect to receive Him</span>, have an obedient heart towards Him) that receive forgiveness of sins through his name:
</p>

Truly, truly, I say to you, whoever <span class="underline">hears my word and believes (G4100 <b>pisteuo</b>) him who sent me has eternal life</span>. He does not come into judgment, but has passed from death to life.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
I believe <code>John 5:24</code> is a true statement and that it should not be read outside of the words Jesus said directly before it (<code>Whoever does not honor the Son does not honor the Father who sent him</code>).
</p>

<p>
We do not nullify the rest of what Jesus has commanded of and asked of us. If Jesus is your judge, then I think it's wise to take on board the rest of what Jesus has said:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Philippians 1:15-22</b> - Some indeed preach Christ from envy and rivalry, but others from good will. The latter do it out of love, knowing that I am put here for the defense of the gospel. The former proclaim Christ out of rivalry, not sincerely but thinking to afflict me in my imprisonment. What then? Only that in every way, whether in pretense or in truth, Christ is proclaimed, and in that I rejoice. Yes, and I will rejoice, for I know that through your prayers and the help of the Spirit of Jesus Christ this will turn out for my deliverance, as <span class="underline">it is my eager expectation and hope that I will not be at all ashamed, but that with full courage now as always Christ will be honored in my body, whether by life or by death</span>. For to me to live is Christ, and to die is gain. <span class="underline">If I am to live in the flesh, that means fruitful labor for me.</span> Yet which I shall choose I cannot tell.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Paul and the other faithful Apostles were exhibited as last of all, like men sentenced to death for following Jesus:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>I Corinthians 4:9-13</b> - For I think that God has exhibited us apostles as last of all, like men sentenced to death, because we have become a spectacle to the world, to angels, and to men. We are fools for Christ's sake, but you are wise in Christ. We are weak, but you are strong. You are held in honor, but we in disrepute. To the present hour we hunger and thirst, we are poorly dressed and buffeted and homeless, and we labor, working with our own hands. When reviled, we bless; when persecuted, we endure; when slandered, we entreat. We have become, and are still, like the scum of the world, the refuse of all things. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
God still makes apostles and prophetic people:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Ephesians 4:11-16</b> - And he gave the apostles, the prophets, the evangelists, the pastors and teachers, to equip the saints for the work of ministry, for building up the body of Christ, until we all attain to the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God, to mature manhood, to the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ, so that we may no longer be children, tossed to and fro by the waves and carried about by every wind of doctrine, by human cunning, by craftiness in deceitful schemes. Rather, speaking the truth in love, we are to grow up in every way into him who is the head, into Christ, from whom the whole body, joined and held together by every joint with which it is equipped, when each part is working properly, makes the body grow so that it builds itself up in love.
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Daniel 2:28</b> - but there is a God in heaven who reveals mysteries, and he has made known to King Nebuchadnezzar what will be in the latter days. Your dream and the visions of your head as you lay in bed are these: (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
God is loving and altogether gracious:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Exodus 34:5-8</b> - The Lord descended in the cloud and stood with him there, and proclaimed the name of the Lord. The Lord passed before him and proclaimed, The Lord, the Lord, a God merciful and gracious, slow to anger, and abounding in steadfast love and faithfulness, keeping steadfast love for thousands, forgiving iniquity and transgression and sin, but who will by no means clear the guilty, visiting the iniquity of the fathers on the children and the children's children, to the third and the fourth generation. And Moses quickly bowed his head toward the earth and worshiped.
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Ezra 9:13</b> - And after all that has come upon us for our evil deeds and for our great guilt, seeing that you, our God, have punished us less than our iniquities deserved and have given us such a remnant as this, (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Having faith in God involves following Jesus:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Hebrews 10:32-39</b> - But recall the former days when, <span class="underline">after you were enlightened, you endured a hard struggle with sufferings, sometimes being publicly exposed to reproach and affliction</span>, and sometimes being partners with those so treated. For you had compassion on those in prison, and you joyfully accepted the plundering of your property, since you knew that you yourselves had a better possession and an abiding one. Therefore do not throw away your confidence, which has a great reward. For you have need of endurance, so that <span class="underline">when you have done the will of God you may receive what is promised</span>. For, Yet a little while, and the coming one will come and will not delay; but my righteous one shall live by faith, and if he shrinks back, my soul has no pleasure in him. But <span class="underline">we are not of those who shrink back and are destroyed, but of those who have faith and preserve their souls</span>.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
I agree whole heartedly with this guy:

</ul>

<p>
I believe that generally-speaking, there is no difference between being a disciple of Jesus and a Christian.
</p>

<p>
There is a transformation in the heart of a born-again Christian that involves changing allegiance towards Jesus Christ, resulting in the will to obey Jesus, and God gives us the spirit to help us to obey Him.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Ezekiel 11:19-20</b> - And I will give them one heart, and a new spirit I will put within them. I will remove the heart of stone from their flesh and give them a heart of flesh, that they may walk in my statutes and keep my rules and obey them. And they shall be my people, and I will be their God. (ESV)

<h3 id="orgdd9636f"><span class="section-number-3">4.7.</span> I believe that a loving, trusting ( <span class="underline">believing</span> and <span class="underline">obedient</span> ) heart for Jesus Christ is essential for permanent abiding in Him</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-4-7">
<p>
After believing in Him we must go ahead in the teaching of Christ:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>II John 1:9</b> - Everyone who goes on ahead and does not abide in the teaching of Christ, does not have God. Whoever abides in the teaching has both the Father and the Son. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Jesus loved us before we loved Him:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>I John 4:19</b> - We love because he first loved us. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
If someone obeys Jesus they should arrive at belief in Jesus and who He is and what He has accomplished; they should accept Him:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>John 8:42</b> - Jesus said to them, If God were your Father, you would love me, for I came from God and I am here. I came not of my own accord, but he sent me.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
If a person believes on Jesus and what He has accomplished they should arrive at obedience, and if they want to be counted as a friend of Jesus, they certainly they <b>must</b> obey Jesus' commandments:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>John 15:10-14</b> - <span class="underline">If you keep my commandments, you will abide in my love,</span> just as I have kept my Father's commandments and abide in his love. These things I have spoken to you, that my joy may be in you, and that your joy may be full. This is my commandment, that you love one another as I have loved you. Greater love has no one than this, that someone lays down his life for his friends. You are my friends <span class="underline">if you do what I command you.</span>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
I think faith in Jesus grows as both of these qualities increase.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Whoever believes in Jesus Christ, the Only-Begotten Son of God, is not condemned.</li>
<li>Otherwise, those who don't believe that fully and do not obey the gospel, I think fall into condemnation.</li>
<li>Those who obey in part yet do not believe the gospel, I think fall into condemnation.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Nevertheless, if someone believes on Him they have begun to obey Him, and so I believe they are in the Lord while they <b>trust in His name, Jesus Christ (Messiah) the Son of God, to be saved</b>, as the following applies:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>John 3:18</b> - Whoever believes in him is not condemned, but whoever does not believe is condemned already, because he has not believed in the name of the only Son of God. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>John 20:31</b> - but these are written so that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that by believing you may have life in his name. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
That's confirmed here by saying that these people are not 'spiritual' but they are still in Christ:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>I Corinthians 3:1</b> - But I, brothers, could not address you as spiritual people, but as people of the flesh, as infants in Christ. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
And as we know, no-one in Christ is condemned:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Romans 8:1</b> - There is therefore now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
So if a person <b>is believing</b> (verb) in Him - I don't think they fall into condemnation, no matter how otherwise disobedient they are.
</p>

<p>
Actually, at some stage I think we have to just rest in the knowledge that it's all about what He did, as far as being saved goes, not what we've done for Him.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Hebrews 4:10</b> - for whoever has entered God's rest has also rested from his works as God did from his. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
God is the justifier, and God is the one who decides who is <b>in Christ.</b>
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>I Corinthians 1:30</b> - But <b>by His doing you are in Christ Jesus,</b> who became to us wisdom from God, and righteousness and sanctification, and redemption, (NASB)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Love (obedience) and belief:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>John 16:27-28</b> - for the Father himself loves you, because you have loved me and have believed that I came from God. I came from the Father and have come into the world, and now I am leaving the world and going to the Father.
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>John 15:16</b> - You did not choose me, but I chose you and appointed you that you should go and bear fruit and that your fruit should abide, so that whatever you ask the Father in my name, he may give it to you.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
It's possible to follow Jesus' voice even before having come to perfect
knowledge and obedience, but Jesus <b>knows</b> His sheep. We must hear Jesus' voice, obey Him, become a slave to righteousness, following His commandments
and at its end, Jesus gives us eternal life:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>John 10:26-29</b> - but you do not believe because you are not part of my flock. My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me. I give them eternal life, and they will never perish, and no one will snatch them out of my hand. My Father, who has given them to me, is greater than all, and no one is able to snatch them out of the Father's hand. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Jesus' sheep:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>hear Jesus' voice</li>
<li>follow Him (they're being obedient)</li>
<li>Jesus knows them</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>John 8:47</b> - Whoever is of God hears the words of God. The reason why you do not hear them is that you are not of God. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
I believe that what this says is that at the point Jesus knows you listen to His voice and obey His voice, He counts you as one of His sheep and He will not let you go.
</p>

<p>
The righteousness that comes through having faith in Jesus Christ - faith (not mere belief) is required to have the righteousness - to be found in Jesus:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Philippians 3:9</b> - and be found in him, not having a righteousness of my own that comes from the law, but that which <b>comes through faith in Christ</b>, the righteousness from God that <b>depends</b> on faith— (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Faith is both believing and obedient, even faith in the heart:

<p>
The drink is to believe that Jesus is the Christ (Messiah), the Son of God, who has come into the world:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>John 4:10-56</b> - Jesus answered her, If you knew the gift of God, and who it is that is saying to you, Give me a drink, you would have asked him, and he would have given you living water. Jesus said to her, Everyone who drinks of this water will be thirsty again, but whoever drinks of the water that I will give him will never be thirsty forever. The water that I will give him will become in him a spring of water welling up to eternal life. So Jesus said to them, Truly, truly, I say to you, unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink his blood, you have no life in you. Whoever feeds on my flesh and drinks my blood has eternal life, and I will raise him up on the last day. For my flesh is true food, and my blood is true drink. Whoever feeds on my flesh and drinks my blood abides in me, and I in him. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
This belief is a free gift which has to be received in faith (you have to believe it):
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>John 7:37-38</b> - On the last day of the feast, the great day, Jesus stood up and cried out, If anyone thirsts, let him come to me and drink. Whoever believes in me, as the Scripture has said, Out of his heart will flow rivers of living water. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
God wants to bring people to the obedience of faith. We have to hear Jesus' word and believe God who sent Him - we have to believe what God has told Jesus to tell us:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>John 5:24</b> - Truly, truly, I say to you, whoever hears my word and believes him who sent me has eternal life. He does not come into judgment, but has passed from death to life. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Therefore, I believe that believing Jesus is the Christ (Messiah), the Son of God, who has come into the world, is God's gift to us and it is a very easy to receive (low barrier to entry) act of obedience to Him:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Romans 16:26</b> - but has now been disclosed and through the prophetic writings has been made known to all nations, according to the command of the eternal God, to bring about the <b>obedience of faith</b> — (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Obedience should grow. A change should have taken place in the person's life:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>John 14:12</b> - Truly, truly, I say to you, whoever believes in me will also do the works that I do; and greater works than these will he do, because I am going to the Father. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
We must have believing, obedient faith in God regarding Jesus Christ His Son as Abraham had faith in God:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Romans 4:9-12</b> - Is this blessing then only for the circumcised, or also for the uncircumcised? We say that faith was counted to Abraham as righteousness. How then was it counted to him? Was it before or after he had been circumcised? It was not after, but before he was circumcised. He received the sign of circumcision as a seal of the righteousness that he had by faith while he was still uncircumcised. The purpose was to make him the father of all who believe without being circumcised, so that righteousness would be counted to them as well, and to make him the father of the circumcised who are <span class="underline">not merely circumcised but who also walk in the footsteps of the faith that our father Abraham had before he was circumcised</span>.
</p>

<p>
Abraham had <span class="underline">righteousness attributed to him when he believed God, while he had an obedient and faithful heart towards God:</span>
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Genesis 15:5-6</b> - And he brought him outside and said, Look toward heaven, and number the stars, if you are able to number them. Then he said to him, So shall your offspring be. And he believed the Lord, and he counted it to him as righteousness.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The blessing was <span class="underline">assured to him by God because of obedience</span> (the obedient works of faith brought him <span class="underline">assurance</span> for God's blessing):
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Genesis 22:17-18</b> - I will surely bless you, and I will surely multiply your offspring as the stars of heaven and as the sand that is on the seashore. And your offspring shall possess the gate of his enemies, and in your offspring shall all the nations of the earth be blessed, because you have obeyed my voice.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Therefore, we should believe with an obedient heart, and obey to receive God's assurance.
</p>

<p>
I believe that every one of Jesus' sheep have a believing, obedient heart, and Jesus knows
who they are and no-one will be able to snatch them from Jesus' hand.
</p>

<p>
I personally believe that it's God's role to justify, not ours, and if we want personal assurance that we are saved, we
must seek and follow Jesus, and arrive at the door.
</p>

<p>
Abraham was obedient the entire time, even when God counted Abraham's belief as righteousness.
We should, likewise <span class="underline">be obedient when we believe.</span>
Abraham was <span class="underline">justified when He believed with an obedient heart</span> but faith was <span class="underline">completed by the works of faith</span> and Abraham was given assurance of the blessing:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>James 2:21-23</b> - Was not Abraham our father justified by works when he offered up his son Isaac on the altar? You see that faith was active along with his works, and faith was completed by his works; and the Scripture was fulfilled that says, Abraham believed God, and it was counted to him as righteousness—and he was called a friend of God. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
I'm going out on a limb when I say that without an obedient heart the so-called belief <span class="underline">doesn't qualify as belief:</span>
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>John 3:36</b> - Whoever believes in the Son has eternal life; whoever does not obey the Son shall not see life, but the wrath of God remains on him. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Eternal salvation goes to those who obey Jesus:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Hebrews 5:8-9</b> - Although he was a son, he learned obedience through what he suffered. And being made perfect, he became the source of eternal salvation to all who obey him, (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
God's commandment is to bring about the obedience of faith (having faith is in God and through Jesus Christ is being obedient to God):
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Romans 16:26</b> - but has now been disclosed and through the prophetic writings has been made known to all nations, according to the command of the eternal God, to bring about the <b>obedience of faith</b> — (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
So to be saved a person <span class="underline">must have an obedient heart, prepared for the good works which are prepared for us to walk in:</span>
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Ephesians 2:8-10</b> - For <b>by grace you have been saved through faith.</b> And this is not your own doing; it is the gift of God, not a result of works, so that no one may boast. For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God prepared beforehand, that we should walk in them.
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>I Peter 2:9</b> - But you are a chosen race, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people for his own possession, that you may <span class="underline">proclaim the excellencies of him who called you out of darkness into his marvelous light.</span> (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Abraham believed and obeyed:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Genesis 26:4-5</b> - I will multiply your offspring as the stars of heaven and will give to your offspring all these lands. And in your offspring all the nations of the earth shall be blessed, because Abraham obeyed my voice and kept my charge, my commandments, my statutes, and my laws. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
One of the criminals crucified next to Jesus came to the obedience of faith and obeyed the gospel:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Luke 23:39-43</b> - One of the criminals who were hanged railed at him, saying, Are you not the Christ? Save yourself and us! But the other rebuked him, saying, Do you not fear God, since you are under the same sentence of condemnation? And we indeed justly, for we are receiving the due reward of our deeds; but this man has done nothing wrong. And he said, Jesus, remember me when you come into your kingdom. And he said to him, Truly, I say to you, today you will be with me in Paradise. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
In this way we must have faith in God the Father of Jesus Christ, and believe and obey Jesus because God commanded it.
</p>

<p>
According to Paul, Abraham trusted God and that trust he had meant he didn't
waver concerning the promise of God, but he grew strong in his faith as he have
glory to God.
</p>

<p>
That's right, and Abraham's faith included:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>faithfulness</li>
<li>giving glory to God</li>
<li>obedience</li>
<li>works of faith</li>
</ul>

<p>
What I mean to say is, the trust in God that Abraham had concerning the promise
of God is exhibited plainly in Abraham's action, and was faithful, enduring,
unwavering, over an amount of time.

<b>Romans 4:20-25</b> - No distrust made him waver concerning the promise of God, but he grew strong in his faith as he gave glory to God, fully convinced that God was able to do what he had promised. That is why his faith was counted to him as righteousness. But the words it was counted to him were not written for his sake alone, but for ours also. It will be counted to us who believe in him who raised from the dead Jesus our Lord, who was delivered up for our trespasses and raised for our justification.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Therefore, when we trust wholeheartedly in God who has raised from the dead Jesus Christ (who is our Lord, meaning we obey Him),
and because we believe, we then inevitably produce working faith.
</p>

<p>
Our faith is exhibited plainly in our action. Our own actions and way of expressing that faith paint a unique picture, with a faith towards God
that may be expressed a little bit differently, in different works of faith, or simply keeping Jesus Christ's words and not denying His name - patient endurance.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Colossians 3:17</b> - And whatever you do, in word or deed, do everything in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God the Father through him.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
But it is all by God's grace that we are saved. A believing and obedient heart is a trusting heart - a heart of faith - and our obedience gives us confidence. All glory to God alone. We must obey Jesus to become like Jesus:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>I John 4:17</b> - By this is love perfected with us, so that we may have confidence for the day of judgment, because as <span class="underline">he is so also are we in this world.</span> (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
We should both believe and obey:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Deuteronomy 30:20</b> - loving the LORD your God, obeying his voice and holding fast to him, for he is your life and length of days, that you may dwell in the land that the LORD swore to your fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, to give them. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Believe and obey (follow) Jesus:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>John 10:24-28</b> - So the Jews gathered around him and said to him, How long will you keep us in suspense? If you are the Christ, tell us plainly. Jesus answered them, I told you, and you do not believe. The works that I do in my Father's name bear witness about me, but you do not believe because you are not part of my flock. My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me. I give them eternal life, and they will never perish, and no one will snatch them out of my hand.
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Exodus 33:17</b> - And the Lord said to Moses, This very thing that you have spoken I will do, for <span class="underline">you have found favor in my sight</span>, and <span class="underline">I know you by name.</span>
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>John 10:16</b> - And I have other sheep that are not of this fold. I must bring them also, and <span class="underline">they will listen to my voice.</span> So there will be one flock, one shepherd. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Jesus knows us and we know Jesus:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>John 10:14</b> - I am the good shepherd. I know my own and my own know me, (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
We must be keeping Jesus' commandments for us to be sure that we have come to know Him:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>I John 2:3-4</b> - And by this we know that we have come to know him, if we keep his commandments. Whoever says I know him but does not keep his commandments is a liar, and the truth is not in him,
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Jesus commands us to take His yoke (obey Him) and learn from Him (believe Him):
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Matthew 11:29</b> - Take my yoke upon you, and learn from me, for I am gentle and lowly in heart, and you will find rest for your souls. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Whoever believes Jesus obeys Jesus - His sheep hear his voice, <span class="underline">trust and obey</span>:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>John 3:36</b> - Whoever believes in the Son has eternal life; whoever does not obey the Son shall not see life, but the wrath of God remains on him. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
God loves those who love Him and keep His commandments:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Nehemiah 1:5</b> - And I said, O Lord God of heaven, the great and awesome God who keeps covenant and steadfast love with <span class="underline">those who love him and keep his commandments,</span>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
If a person has an obedient and believing heart - a heart of faith - towards Jesus, then they <span class="underline">will be</span> saved:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>If a person truthfully confesses (admits) with their mouth that Jesus is Lord, they have an obedient heart.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>This must result in the person obeying Jesus; freely forgiving others, loving others as He loved us, <span class="underline">keeping Jesus' commandments</span></li>
</ul></li>
<li>If they believe in their heart that God raised Jesus from the dead, they believe Jesus, and believe God who sent Him.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>This must result in the person accepting forgiveness for sin</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Romans 10:9</b> - because, if you confess with your mouth that Jesus is Lord and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
I believe that a person does not have any <span class="underline">security</span> of eternal salvation unless they have in their heart <span class="underline">obedient, believing faith</span> in Jesus Christ, and even then there is often a race and a journey to receive it.
</p>

<p>
The knowledge of the truth is for those who abide in Jesus' word and follow Him:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>John 8:31-32</b> - So Jesus said to the Jews who had believed in him, If you abide in my word, you are truly my disciples, and you will know the truth, and the truth will set you free.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
I believe that obedience is as intrinsic and necessary to faith as belief is.
</p>

<p>
The good news must be united by obedient faith (putting Jesus' words into action):
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Hebrews 4:1-2</b> - Therefore, while the promise of entering his rest still stands, let us fear lest any of you should seem to have failed to reach it. For good news came to us just as to them, but the message they heard did not benefit them, because they were not united by faith with those who listened. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Philippians 2:12</b> - Therefore, my beloved, as you have <b>always obeyed</b>, so now, not only as in my presence but much more in my absence, work out (katergazomai) your own salvation with fear and trembling, (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
I believe in 'once saved, always saved, <span class="underline">while doing the will of God</span>'. So someone must be a both a believer and a follower of Jesus.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>I John 2:17</b> - And the world is passing away along with its desires, but <span class="underline">whoever does the will of God abides forever.</span>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
I think we are permanently saved when we are following Jesus.
</p>

<p>
We are saved from dying by Jesus giving us His Spirit and then,
so long as we are His sheep, coming to Him (by following His commandments), we will live forever, in Him.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>John 6:37</b> - All that the Father gives me will come to me, and <span class="underline">whoever comes to me</span> I will never cast out. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
I believe that anyone who is trusting in Jesus for His finished work is saved. Believing the gospel is obeying the gospel. I just think there's more to it in terms of abiding forever. Because we must bear fruit etc. and follow His commandments to come to know Him. I don't condemn anyone who is believing on Him for life through His name.
</p>

<p>
Doing the will of God is what it means to be led by the Spirit. So you have to <b>do</b> the will of God, being a servant of Christ under the law of Christ, to have the blessing of not being condemned by the law of Moses:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Psalms 143:10</b> - <span class="underline">Teach me to do your will,</span> for you are my God! <b>Let your good Spirit lead me</b> on level ground! (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Jesus Christ is the Lord referred to:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>II Corinthians 3:15-18</b> - Yes, to this day whenever Moses is read a veil lies over their hearts. But when one turns to the Lord, the veil is removed. Now the Lord <i>(Κύριος, Kyrios, Lord, Master)</i> is the Spirit, and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom. And we all, with unveiled face, beholding the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into the same image from one degree of glory to another. For this comes from the Lord who is the Spirit. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Walk according to the will of God. Walk the way Jesus Christ has called us to walk. <b>Led by the Spirit = following Jesus</b>:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Galatians 5:16-18</b> - But I say, <b>walk by the Spirit</b>, and you will not gratify the desires of the flesh. For the desires of the flesh are against the Spirit, and the desires of the Spirit are against the flesh, for these are opposed to each other, to keep you from doing the things you want to do. But <b>if</b> you are led by the Spirit, you are not under the law.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Jesus' disciples here were being led by Jesus:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Matthew 12:1-8</b> - At that time Jesus went through the grainfields on the Sabbath. His disciples were hungry, and they began to pluck heads of grain and to eat. But when the Pharisees saw it, they said to him, Look, your disciples are doing what is not lawful to do on the Sabbath. He said to them, Have you not read what David did when he was hungry, and those who were with him: how he entered the house of God and ate the bread of the Presence, which it was not lawful for him to eat nor for those who were with him, but only for the priests? Or have you not read in the Law how on the Sabbath the priests in the temple profane the Sabbath and are guiltless? I tell you, something greater than the temple is here. And if you had known what this means, I desire mercy, and not sacrifice, you would not have condemned the guiltless. For the Son of Man is lord of the Sabbath. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Those who love Him, obey Him:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>John 14:15-16</b> - <b>If you love me, you will keep my commandments.</b> And I will ask the Father, and he will give you another Helper, to be with you forever, (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>James 1:12</b> - Blessed is the man who remains steadfast under <b>trial,</b> for when he has stood the test he will receive the <span class="underline">crown of life,</span> which God has promised to <b>those who love him.</b> (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
We love God and our brothers and sisters in Christ by following God's commandments:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>I John 5:1-3</b> - Everyone who believes that Jesus is the Christ has been born of God, and everyone who loves the Father loves whoever has been born of him. By this we know that we love the children of God, when we love God and obey his commandments. For this is the love of God, that we keep his commandments. And his commandments are not burdensome. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The crown of life is gifted to those who are obedient, and have been tested:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Revelation 2:10</b> - Do not fear what you are about to suffer. Behold, the devil is about to throw some of you into prison, that you may be <b>tested,</b> and for ten days you will have tribulation. Be faithful unto death, and I will give you the <span class="underline">crown of life.</span> (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
And I also think people have free will to sabotage their race.
</p>

<p>
Clearly 'believe' means also 'to be obedient' to because the ones that <span class="underline">follow Jesus</span> (which means obey His commandments) are the ones who are counted as believing (<b>pisteuo</b>):
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>John 10:26-38</b> - but you do not believe (G4100 <b>pisteuo</b>) because you are not part of my flock. My sheep <span class="underline">hear my voice,</span> and <span class="underline">I know them, and they follow me.</span> I give them eternal life, and they will never perish, and no one will snatch them out of my hand. My Father, who has given them to me, is greater than all, and no one is able to snatch them out of the Father's hand. I and the Father are one.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Those enslaved by corruption are not sons:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>II Peter 2:19</b> - They promise them freedom, but they themselves are slaves of corruption. For whatever overcomes a person, to that he is enslaved.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
People fall away if they are not freed from sin. We're seeking to be freed from sin:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>John 8:34-36</b> - Jesus answered them, Truly, truly, I say to you, everyone who commits sin is a slave to sin. The slave does not remain in the house forever; the son remains forever. So if the Son sets you free, you will be free indeed. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
We seek to be adopted as sons. To receive the Spirit of God's Son in our hearts is what I think it means to be set free by the Son:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Galatians 4:4-9</b> - But when the fullness of time had come, God sent forth his Son, born of woman, born under the law, to redeem those who were under the law, so that we might receive adoption as sons. And because you are sons, God has <span class="underline">sent the Spirit of his Son into our hearts, crying, Abba! Father!</span> So you are no longer a slave, but a son, and if a son, then an heir through God. Formerly, when you did not know God, you were enslaved to those that by nature are not gods. But now that you have come to know God, or rather to be known by God, how can you turn back again to the weak and worthless elementary principles of the world, whose slaves you want to be once more? (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
I guess that means we should become slaves of Christ! We should be overcome by Christ:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Romans 6:22-23</b>- But now that you have been set free from sin and have become slaves of God, the fruit you get leads to sanctification and its end, eternal life. For the wages of sin is death, but the free gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Romans 6:16</b> - Do you not know that if you present yourselves to anyone as obedient slaves, you are slaves of the one whom you obey, either of sin, which leads to death, or of obedience, which leads to righteousness? (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Christ's Spirit is a spirit of adoption as sons, by whom we cry, "Abba! Father!" It's not a spirit of slavery. So with a spirit of adoption we are slaves to God:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Romans 8:13-17</b> - For if you live according to the flesh you will die, but if by the Spirit you put to death the deeds of the body, you will live. For all who are led by the Spirit of God are sons of God. For you did not receive the spirit of slavery to fall back into fear, but you have received the Spirit of adoption as sons, by whom we cry, Abba! Father! The Spirit himself bears witness with our spirit that we are children of God, and if children, then heirs—heirs of God and fellow heirs with Christ, provided we suffer with him in order that we may also be glorified with him. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
We must be in Christ Jesus as a new creation:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>II Corinthians 5:17</b> - Therefore, <b>if</b> anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation. The old has passed away; behold, the new has come.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
A <b>new creation</b> has <span class="underline">faith working through love</span> and <span class="underline">keeps Jesus Christ's commandments</span>:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Galatians 6:15</b> - For neither <span class="underline">circumcision counts for anything, nor uncircumcision,</span> but <b>a new creation.</b> (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Galatians 5:6</b> - For in Christ Jesus <span class="underline">neither circumcision nor uncircumcision counts for anything,</span> but only <b>faith working through love.</b> (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>I Corinthians 7:19</b> - For <span class="underline">neither circumcision counts for anything nor uncircumcision,</span> but <b>keeping the commandments of God.</b> (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
A new creation lives for Christ:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>II Corinthians 5:14-17</b> - For the love of Christ controls us, because we have concluded this: that one has died for all, therefore all have died; and <span class="underline">he died for all, that those who live might no longer live for themselves but for him</span> who for their sake died and was raised. From now on, therefore, we regard no one according to the flesh. Even though we once regarded Christ according to the flesh, we regard him thus no longer. Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation. The old has passed away; behold, the new has come.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Following Jesus Christ is not having a religious spirit, but it's serving God in reality.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Galatians 3:26</b> - for in Christ Jesus you are all sons of God, through faith. (ESV)

Jesus has to know us:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Matthew 25:1-13</b> - Then the kingdom of heaven will be like ten virgins who took their lamps and went to meet the bridegroom. Five of them were foolish, and five were wise. For when the foolish took their lamps, they took no oil with them, but the wise took flasks of oil with their lamps. As the bridegroom was delayed, they all became drowsy and slept. But at midnight there was a cry, Here is the bridegroom! Come out to meet him. Then all those virgins rose and trimmed their lamps. And the foolish said to the wise, Give us some of your oil, for our lamps are going out. But the wise answered, saying, Since there will not be enough for us and for you, go rather to the dealers and buy for yourselves. And while they were going to buy, the bridegroom came, and those who were ready went in with him to the marriage feast, and the door was shut. Afterward the other virgins came also, saying, Lord, lord, open to us. But he answered, <span class="underline">Truly, I say to you, I do not know you.</span> Watch therefore, for you know neither the day nor the hour.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
I believe that Jesus has a lot of grace for the weak and the powerless, the children and the humble:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Revelation of John 3:8</b> - I know your works. Behold, I have set before you an open door, which no one is able to shut. I know that <span class="underline">you have but little power, and yet you have kept my word and have not denied my name.</span>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
And it's about the heart:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Mark 12:41-44</b> - And he sat down opposite the treasury and watched the people putting money into the offering box. Many rich people put in large sums. And a poor widow came and put in two small copper coins, which make a penny. And he called his disciples to him and said to them, Truly, I say to you, <span class="underline">this poor widow has put in more than all those who are contributing to the offering box. For they all contributed out of their abundance, but she out of her poverty has put in everything she had, all she had to live on.</span> (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Good work is rewarded. Lazy, disobedient belief is punished, and the worthless servant who was entrusted with some work but was unfaithful with his work (doesn't matter how much work it is) is cast away. Jesus isn't a hard taskmaster but wants our whole heart. Jesus must be our Master:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Matthew 25:14-30</b> - For it will be like a man going on a journey, who called his servants and entrusted to them his property. To one he gave five talents, to another two, to another one, to each according to his ability. Then he went away. He who had received the five talents went at once and traded with them, and he made five talents more. So also he who had the two talents made two talents more. But he who had received the one talent went and dug in the ground and hid his master's money. Now after a long time the master of those servants came and settled accounts with them. And he who had received the five talents came forward, bringing five talents more, saying, Master, you delivered to me five talents; here I have made five talents more. <span class="underline">His master said to him, Well done, good and faithful servant.</span> You have been faithful over a little; I will set you over much. Enter into the joy of your master. And he also who had the two talents came forward, saying, Master, you delivered to me two talents; here I have made two talents more. His master said to him, Well done, good and faithful servant. You have been faithful over a little; I will set you over much. Enter into the joy of your master. He also who had received the one talent came forward, saying, Master, I knew you to be a hard man, reaping where you did not sow, and gathering where you scattered no seed, so I was afraid, and I went and hid your talent in the ground. Here you have what is yours. But his master answered him, You wicked and slothful servant! You knew that I reap where I have not sowed and gather where I scattered no seed? Then you ought to have invested my money with the bankers, and at my coming I should have received what was my own with interest. So take the talent from him and give it to him who has the ten talents. For to everyone who has will more be given, and he will have an abundance. But from the one who has not, even what he has will be taken away. And cast the <span class="underline">worthless servant</span> into the outer darkness. In that place there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.

The righteous obey Jesus, and love our neighbour as He loved them; as He commanded:

Before him will be gathered all the nations, and he will separate people one from another as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats. And he will place the sheep on his right, but the goats on the left. Then the King will say to those on his right, Come, you who are blessed by my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world. For I was hungry and you gave me food, I was thirsty and you gave me drink, I was a stranger and you welcomed me, <span class="underline">I was naked and you clothed me, I was sick and you visited me, I was in prison and you came to me.</span> Then the righteous will answer him, saying, Lord, when did we see you hungry and feed you, or thirsty and give you drink? And when did we see you a stranger and welcome you, or naked and clothe you? And when did we see you sick or in prison and visit you? And the King will answer them, Truly, I say to you, <span class="underline">as you did it to one of the least of these my brothers, you did it to me.</span>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The ones who do not obey Jesus go to eternal punishment:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Matthew 25:41-45</b> - Then he will say to those on his left, Depart from me, you cursed, into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels. For I was hungry and you gave me no food, I was thirsty and you gave me no drink, I was a stranger and you did not welcome me, naked and you did not clothe me, sick and in prison and you did not visit me. Then they also will answer, saying, Lord, when did we see you hungry or thirsty or a stranger or naked or sick or in prison, and did not minister to you? Then he will answer them, saying, Truly, I say to you, as you did not do it to one of the least of these, you did not do it to me.

Repentance:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Someone who has <span class="underline">only belief in the gift of grace and no obedience to Jesus</span> (which is effectively hating Jesus) <span class="underline">must repent</span> and come to have an obedient heart.</li>

<p>
If people from either category do not repent, then beware because God has the ability and jurisdiction to <span class="underline">cast that person out - graft them out of Christ.</span> Also, let's not become proud, but stand in awe.
</p>

<p>
God draws the person to Jesus:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>John 6:44-46</b> - No one can come to me unless the Father who sent me draws him. And I will raise him up on the last day. It is written in the Prophets, And they will all be taught by God. Everyone who has heard and learned from the Father comes to me— not that anyone has seen the Father except he who is from God; he has seen the Father. (ESV)

<b>John 6:37</b> - All that the Father gives me will come to me, and <span class="underline">whoever comes to me</span> I will never cast out. (ESV)

Coming to Jesus is the requirement for not being cast out, and coming to Jesus Christ means obedience and following Jesus:

And Jesus said to him, Why do you call me good? No one is good except God alone. You know the commandments: Do not commit adultery, Do not murder, Do not steal, Do not bear false witness, Honor your father and mother. And he said, All these I have kept from my youth. When Jesus heard this, he said to him, One thing you still lack. Sell all that you have and distribute to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; and come, follow me.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
We must be a servant of Jesus to not be cast out. We must have obedience:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>John 12:26</b> - If <span class="underline">anyone serves me, he must follow me;</span> and <span class="underline">where I am, there will my servant be also.</span> If anyone serves me, the Father will honor him. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Coming to Jesus involves <span class="underline">denying ourself</span> and taking up our cross daily to follow Him:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Luke 9:23</b> - And he said to all, If anyone would come after me, let him deny himself and take up his cross daily and follow me. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Christ Jesus judged Paul <b>faithful</b> - Paul was faithful, and Jesus Christ is Paul's Lord.
Paul received mercy to become obedient.
Paul received mercy because he was <b>acting ignorantly</b> - behaving in a way which came from disbelief.
So then, Christ Jesus displays in Paul His perfect patience to those who would trust in Him for eternal life and be brought from ungodliness into godliness - disobedience into obedience.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>I Timothy 1:12-16</b> - I thank him who has given me strength, Christ Jesus our Lord, because he judged me faithful, appointing me to his service, though formerly I was a blasphemer, persecutor, and insolent opponent. But I received mercy because I had acted ignorantly in unbelief, and the grace of our Lord overflowed for me with the faith and love that are in Christ Jesus. The saying is trustworthy and deserving of full acceptance, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners, of whom I am the foremost. But I received mercy for this reason, that in me, as the foremost, Jesus Christ might display his perfect patience as an example to those who were to believe in him for eternal life. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
You <b>must</b> believe:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Romans 11:20-23</b> - That is true. <span class="underline">They were broken off because of their unbelief, but you stand fast through faith.</span> So do not become proud, but stand in awe. For if God did not spare the natural branches, neither will he spare you. And even they, if they do not continue in their unbelief, will be grafted in, for God has the power to graft them in again.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
You <b>must</b> obey:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>John 15:1-6</b> - I am the true vine, and my Father is the vinedresser.  Every branch of mine that does not bear fruit he takes away, and every branch that does bear fruit he prunes, that it may bear more fruit.  Already you are clean because of the word that I have spoken to you.  Abide in me, and I in you. As the branch cannot bear fruit by itself, unless it abides in the vine, neither can you, unless you abide in me.  I am the vine; you are the branches. Whoever abides in me and I in him, he it is that bears much fruit, for apart from me you can do nothing. <span class="underline">If anyone does not abide in me he is thrown away like a branch and withers; and the branches are gathered, thrown into the fire, and burned.</span>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
We <b>must</b> put a stop to sin:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Ezekiel 18:20-21</b> - The soul who sins shall die. The son shall not suffer for the iniquity of the father, nor the father suffer for the iniquity of the son. The righteousness of the righteous shall be upon himself, and the wickedness of the wicked shall be upon himself. But if a wicked person turns away from all his sins that he has committed and keeps all my statutes and does what is just and right, he shall surely live; he shall not die. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Jeremiah 4:4</b> - Circumcise yourselves to the LORD; remove the foreskin of your hearts, O men of Judah and inhabitants of Jerusalem; lest my wrath go forth like fire, and burn with none to quench it, because of the evil of your deeds. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
So I believe that Jesus saves us by giving us of His Spirit and helping us to put sin to death, through obedient faith:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>1 John 3:4-9</b> - Everyone who makes a practice of sinning also practices lawlessness; sin is lawlessness.  You know that <b>he appeared to take away sins, and in him there is no sin.  No one who abides in him keeps on sinning; no one who keeps on sinning has either seen him or known him.</b>  Little children, let no one deceive you.  Whoever practices righteousness is righteous, as he is righteous.  Whoever makes a practice of sinning is of the devil, for the devil has been sinning from the beginning.  The reason the Son of God appeared was to destroy the works of the devil.  No one born of God makes a practice of sinning, for God's seed abides in him, and he cannot keep on sinning because he has been born of God.  (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Walking in obedient faith is walking in forgiveness and love towards other people, forgiveness and love that flows out from <span class="underline">having been</span> loved and having been forgiven.
</p>

<p>
The faith working through love towards God and other people flows out of believing in and accepting Jesus and His atoning sacrifice and from being freely forgiven by Jesus.
</p>

<p>
I think the person who has arrived at this point has repented from dead work and is now living for Jesus.

<p>
To be saved we need to have an obedient heart to God.

<p>

<p>
Living as a new Creation in Christ means God has given you the heart to desire to obey Jesus' commandments. We are under Christ's law.
</p>

<p>
It means, through the power of <b>the Holy Spirit</b>, to no longer practice lying, adultery, idolatry, and covetousness, and to no longer dishonour our parents, and to now honour Jesus Christ in our lives and bodies.
</p>

<p>
It's going from disobedience to God (as Adam was disobedient) to obedience to God (as Christ is obedient):
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Romans 15:17-18</b> - In Christ Jesus, then, I have reason to be proud of my work for God. For I will not venture to speak of anything except what Christ has accomplished through me to bring the Gentiles to obedience—by word and deed,

</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>I Corinthians 7:19</b> - For <span class="underline">neither circumcision counts for anything nor uncircumcision,</span> but <b>keeping the commandments of God.</b> (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Faith works through love; we must be like Jesus - exercising sacrificial, merciful love. The term 'new creature' is used in Galatians 6 after saying we must 'put sin to death and do good', sowing to the spirit and not to the flesh.
Sowing to the Spirit is obediently following Jesus:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Galatians 6:7-8</b> - Do not be deceived: God is not mocked, for whatever one sows, that will he also reap. For the one who sows to his own flesh will from the flesh reap corruption, but the one who sows to the Spirit will from the Spirit reap eternal life. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Faith is obedient. Love is applied faith in Jesus:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Galatians 5:6</b> - For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision nor uncircumcision counts for anything, but only <span class="underline">faith working through love.</span> (ESV)
</p>

<p>
Grace is free, but a person <b>must</b> become obedient - God gives the heart to obey, but a person must desire to do God's will to receive it.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Revelation of John 22:3</b> - No longer will there be anything accursed, but <span class="underline">the throne of God and of the Lamb</span> will be in it, and <b>his servants will worship him.</b> (ESV)

<p>
We must live for the will of God:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>I Peter 4:1-2</b> - Since therefore Christ suffered in the flesh, arm yourselves with the same way of thinking, for <span class="underline">whoever has suffered in the flesh has ceased from sin, so as to live for the rest of the time in the flesh no longer for human passions but for the will of God.</span> (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
If a person doesn't obey Jesus and His commandments then they probably are not saved because they either deny they have the spiritual circumcision which causes us to obey,
or they do not have the heart to obey and receive salvation - so they are a goat, not a sheep.
</p>

<blockquote>

</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The power of God <b>works</b> in us to sanctify us! We must realise that, that the gospel is the <b>power of God</b> for salvation to everyone who believes.
</p>

<p>
We have believing, obedient faith in the powerful working of God:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Colossians 2:12</b> - having been buried with him in baptism, in which you were also raised with him <b>through faith in the powerful working of God,</b> who raised him from the dead. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
God works his power mightily towards those who believe:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Ephesians 1:19</b> - and what is the immeasurable greatness of his power toward us who believe, according to the working of his great might (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Our faith should rest in the power of God - we should know God's power experientially:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>I Corinthians 2:5</b> - that your faith might not rest in the wisdom of men but in the power of God. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
<b>Paul toils</b>, <span class="underline">struggling with all God's energy</span> that <b>God works</b> powerfully within him:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Colossians 1:29</b> - For this <b>I toil, struggling</b> <span class="underline">with all</span> <b>his</b> energy that <b>he powerfully works within me.</b> (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Paul could noticeably see the power working within him and the others:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Ephesians 3:20</b> - Now to him who is able to do far more abundantly than all that we ask or think, according to the power at work within us, (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The true gospel comes in power:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>I Thessalonians 1:5</b> - because <b>our gospel</b> came to you <b>not only in word,</b> but also <b>in power</b> and in the Holy Spirit and with full conviction. You know what kind of men we proved to be among you for your sake. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
By the power of God, we share in suffering for the gospel:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>II Timothy 1:8</b> - Therefore do not be ashamed of the testimony about our Lord, nor of me his prisoner, but <b>share in suffering for the gospel by the power of God,</b> (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The gospel allows us to become partakers of the divine nature, having escaped the lusts of the world:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>II Peter 1:3-4</b> - seeing that His divine power has granted to us everything pertaining to life and godliness, <b>through the true knowledge</b> of Him who called us by His own glory and excellence. For by these He has granted to us <span class="underline">His precious and magnificent promises,</span> so that <b>by them you may become partakers of the divine nature, having escaped the corruption that is in the world by lust.</b> (NASB)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Some people will deny the <b>power</b> of the gospel:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>II Timothy 3:1-7</b> - But understand this, that in the last days there will come times of difficulty. For people will be lovers of self, lovers of money, proud, arrogant, abusive, disobedient to their parents, ungrateful, unholy, heartless, unappeasable, slanderous, without self-control, brutal, not loving good, treacherous, reckless, swollen with conceit, lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God, <span class="underline">having the appearance of godliness, but denying its power</span>. Avoid such people. For among them are those who creep into households and capture weak women, burdened with sins and led astray by various passions, always learning and never able to arrive at a <b>knowledge of the truth</b>. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Jesus Christ bore the punishment for our iniquity to bring us peace with God:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Isaiah 53:5</b> - But he was wounded for our transgressions; he was crushed for our iniquities; upon him was the chastisement that brought us peace, and with his stripes we are healed. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
We must yield to Jesus. The Spirit we receive causes and helps us to obey. Our obedience is accredited to God working through us:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Ezekiel 11:19-20</b> - And I will give them one heart, and a new spirit I will put within them. I will remove the heart of stone from their flesh and give them a heart of flesh, that they may walk in my statutes and keep my rules and obey them. And they shall be my people, and I will be their God. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Jesus does work through us as we are believing in Him:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Philippians 2:13</b> - for it is <b>God who works in you, both to will and to work</b> for his good pleasure. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Jesus makes it clear that the ones who believe do the same works He does:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>John 14:12</b> - Truly, truly, I say to you, whoever believes in me will also do the works that I do; and greater works than these will he do, because I am going to the Father. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
We have <b>always obeyed</b>, participating in the Spirit, having one mind, that of a servant - God works through us:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Philippians 2:1-13</b> - So if there is any encouragement in Christ, any comfort from love, any <span class="underline">participation in the Spirit,</span> any affection and sympathy, complete my joy by being of the same mind, having the same love, being in full accord and of one mind. Do nothing from rivalry or conceit, but in humility count others more significant than yourselves. Let each of you look not only to his own interests, but also to the interests of others. Have this mind among yourselves, which is yours in Christ Jesus, who, though he was in the form of God, did not count equality with God a thing to be grasped, but made himself nothing, <b>taking the form of a servant</b>, being born in the likeness of men. And being found in human form, he humbled himself by becoming obedient to the point of death, even death on a cross. Therefore God has highly exalted him and bestowed on him the name that is above every name, so that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, in heaven and on earth and under the earth, and every tongue confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father. Therefore, my beloved, as you have always obeyed, so now, not only as in my presence but much more in my absence, <b>work out your own salvation with fear and trembling, for it is God who works in you, both to will and to work</b> for his good pleasure. (ESV)

'Believing obedience' produces work.
</p>

<p>
We are saved through faith - it's not our own doing - it's not a <b>result</b> of works - the works are a gift:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Ephesians 2:8-9</b> - For <b>by grace you have been saved through faith.</b> And this is not your own doing; it is the gift of God, not a result of works, so that no one may boast. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Whoever trusts in Jesus Christ shouldn't perish, but they should have eternal life. We've just got to have faith in Jesus:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>John 3:16-21</b> - For God so loved the world, that he gave his only Son, that whoever (G3956 pas) believes (G4100 pisteuo) in him should not perish but have eternal life. For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but in order that the world might be saved through him. Whoever believes in him is not condemned, but whoever does not believe is condemned already, because he has not believed in the name of the only Son of God. And this is the judgment: the light has come into the world, and people loved the darkness rather than the light because their deeds were evil. For everyone who does wicked things hates the light and does not come to the light, lest his deeds should be exposed. But <span class="underline">whoever does what is true comes to the light</span>, so that <span class="underline">it may be clearly seen that his deeds have been carried out in God</span>. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The gospel <i>involves</i> having <span class="underline">believing</span> <b>and</b> <span class="underline">obedient</span> heart. The entrypoint is believing in Jesus Christ to be saved - that itself is an act of obedience.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>John 6:28-29</b> - Then they said to him, <span class="underline">What must we do, to be doing the works of God?</span> Jesus answered them, This is the work of God, that <b>you believe (G4100 pisteuo) in him whom he has sent.</b> (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The obedience of heart:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>having of faith in Jesus and Jesus' name.</li>
</ul>

<p>
The obedience produces work:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>carrying out deeds done in God.</li>
<li>coming to the light.</li>
</ul>

<p>
If belief and obedience can even be separated, I think being saved starts with belief or obedience and arrives at both belief and obedience.
Belief and obedience are both fundamental qualities of faith.
</p>

<p>
Notice how just after <b>John 3:16</b> it says, "whoever <span class="underline">does what is true comes to the light.</span>"
</p>

<p>
<span class="underline">Whoever has faith in and puts their trust in in Jesus Christ is not condemned and should not perish.</span>
</p>

<p>
We have <b>always obeyed</b> - God works through us:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Philippians 2:12-13</b> - Therefore, my beloved, as you have <b>always obeyed</b>, so now, not only as in my presence but much more in my absence, work out (katergazomai) your own salvation with fear and trembling, for it is <b>God who works in you, both to will and to work</b> for his good pleasure. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
We must honour Jesus Christ:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>John 5:21-24</b> - For as the Father raises the dead and gives them life, so also the Son gives life to whom he will. The Father judges no one, but has given all judgment to the Son, that all may honor the Son, just as they honor the Father. <span class="underline">Whoever does not honor the Son does not honor the Father who sent him</span>. Truly, truly, I say to you, whoever <span class="underline">hears my word and believes (G4100 <b>pisteuo</b>) him who sent me has eternal life</span>. He does not come into judgment, but has passed from death to life.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
I believe <code>John 5:24</code> is a true statement and that it should not be read outside of the words Jesus said directly before it (<code>Whoever does not honor the Son does not honor the Father who sent him</code>).
</p>

<p>
We do not nullify the rest of what Jesus has commanded of and asked of us. If Jesus is your judge, then I think it's wise to take on board the rest of what Jesus has said:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Philippians 1:15-22</b> - Some indeed preach Christ from envy and rivalry, but others from good will. The latter do it out of love, knowing that I am put here for the defense of the gospel. The former proclaim Christ out of rivalry, not sincerely but thinking to afflict me in my imprisonment. What then? Only that in every way, whether in pretense or in truth, Christ is proclaimed, and in that I rejoice. Yes, and I will rejoice, for I know that through your prayers and the help of the Spirit of Jesus Christ this will turn out for my deliverance, as <span class="underline">it is my eager expectation and hope that I will not be at all ashamed, but that with full courage now as always Christ will be honored in my body, whether by life or by death</span>. For to me to live is Christ, and to die is gain. <span class="underline">If I am to live in the flesh, that means fruitful labor for me.</span> Yet which I shall choose I cannot tell.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
We're not justified through the works of the law but through faith, and faith involves obedience to Jesus Christ:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Galatians 2:15-16</b> - “We are Jews by nature and not sinners from among the Gentiles; nevertheless knowing that a man is not justified by the works of the Law but through faith in Christ Jesus, even we have believed in Christ Jesus, so that we may be <b>justified by faith in Christ</b> and not by the works of the Law; since by the works of the Law no flesh will be justified.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
It's by faith in Christ that we are justified, and faith involves obedience (at least of the heart).
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>John 3:36</b> - Whoever believes (G4100 pisteuo) in the Son has eternal life; whoever does not <b>obey</b> the Son shall not see life, but the wrath of God remains on him. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
It's faith in the heart which we need; obedience to Jesus Christ and belief in Jesus Christ in the heart, and belief and obedience to God who has <span class="underline">raised from the dead Jesus our Lord, who was delivered up for our trespasses and raised for our justification</span>.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>John 3:16</b> - For God so loved the world, that he gave his only Son, that whoever believes (G4100 pisteuo) in him should not perish but have eternal life. (ESV)

Jesus Christ is the Son of the Living God. Believing on His name is God's will for us, and loving one another is God's will for us as He has commanded. There is more that Jesus has commanded us, too.

<p>
The grace given to Paul allowed him to turn from his evil ways and pursue Jesus, working diligently for Jesus. Therefore, the grace given to Paul was not in vain, because Paul responded well to the grace:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>I Corinthians 15:10</b> - But by the grace of God I am what I am, and his grace toward me was not in vain. On the contrary, I worked harder than any of them, though it was not I, but the grace of God that is with me. (ESV)

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-4-10">
<p>
The free gift is to be set free from sin to be
a salve of righteousness - that is received
through faith, received by those who obey Jesus.
</p>

<p>
The faith that receives the free gift of salvation is obedient to Jesus.
</p>

<p>
So when the Spirit begins working in you, and
you obey, you are receiving the salvation.
</p>

<p>
Is this considered being saved by works or being saved by faith?
</p>

<p>
This is considered being saved by faith and not by works.
</p>

<p>
We must now consider ourselves dead to sin and alive to God in Christ Jesus.
We must now present ourselves as obedient slaves to righteousness - yes, practicing personal righteousness in accordance with Jesus Christ's commandments.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Romans 6</b> - What shall we say then? Are we to continue in sin that grace may abound? By no means! How can we who died to sin still live in it? Do you not know that <b>all of us who have been baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into his death?</b> We were buried therefore with him by baptism into death, in order that, just as Christ was raised from the dead by the glory of the Father, we too might walk in newness of life. For <b>if we have been united with him in a death like his, we shall certainly be united with him in a resurrection like his</b>. We know that our old self was crucified with him in order that the body of sin might be brought to nothing, so that we would no longer be enslaved to sin. For one who has died has been set free from sin. Now if we have died with Christ, we believe that we will also live with him. We know that Christ being raised from the dead will never die again; death no longer has dominion over him. For the death he died he died to sin, once for all, but the life he lives he lives to God. So <b>you also must consider yourselves dead to sin and alive to God in Christ Jesus.</b> Let not sin therefore reign in your mortal bodies, to make you obey their passions. Do not present your members to sin as instruments for unrighteousness, but present yourselves to God as those who have been brought from death to life, and your members to God as instruments for righteousness. For sin will have no dominion over you, since you are not under law but under grace. What then? Are we to sin because we are not under law but under grace? By no means! Do you not know that if you present yourselves to anyone as obedient slaves, you are slaves of the one whom you obey, either of sin, which leads to death, or of obedience, which leads to righteousness? But thanks be to God, that you who were once slaves of sin have become obedient <b>from the heart</b> to the standard of teaching to which you were committed, and, having been set free from sin, have become slaves of righteousness. I am speaking in human terms, because of your natural limitations. For just as you once presented your members as slaves to impurity and to lawlessness leading to more lawlessness, so now present your members as slaves to righteousness leading to sanctification. When you were slaves of sin, you were free in regard to righteousness. But what fruit were you getting at that time from the things of which you are now ashamed? The end of those things is death. But now that you have been set free from sin and have become slaves of God, the fruit you get leads to sanctification and its end, eternal life. For the wages of sin is death, but <b>the free gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.</b> (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Therefore, to be in Christ Jesus our Lord, God puts us in and we then have a change of mindset, presenting ourselves as obedient slaves to Jesus Christ. Is that considered a bad thing to be a slave to righteousness? No, it's considered as being in Christ Jesus.
</p>

<p>
The Holy Spirit in us <b>is the gift</b> which is in us:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>II Timothy 1:6-7</b> - For this reason I remind you to fan into flame the gift of God, which is in you through the laying on of my hands, for God gave us a spirit not of fear but of power and love and self-control. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>II Corinthians 1:21-22</b> - And it is God who establishes us with you in Christ, and has anointed us, and who has also put his seal on us and given us his Spirit in our hearts as a guarantee. (ESV)

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-4-10-1">
<p>
God poured out His Holy Spirit richly on us through Jesus Christ our Saviour. This would not be possible without having sent Jesus Christ to die for our sins and be raised for our justification. To be able to be justified is pure grace. To be able to have faith in Jesus is pure grace.
But we must put our faith in Jesus Christ!
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Titus 3:4-7</b> - But when the goodness and loving kindness of God our Savior appeared, he saved us, not because of works done by us in righteousness, but according to his own mercy, by the washing of regeneration and renewal of <b>the Holy Spirit</b>, whom he poured out on us richly through Jesus Christ our Savior, so that being justified by his grace we might become heirs according to the hope of eternal life. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
So we should ask God to receive <b>the Holy Spirit</b>, and believe He will give <b>the Holy Spirit</b> to us:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Luke 11:13</b> - If you then, who are evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will the heavenly Father give <b>the Holy Spirit</b> to those who ask him! (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
This says Father God gives <b>the Holy Spirit</b> to His children. Then we should seek to behave His children and ask Him.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>I John 3:10</b> - By this it is evident who are the children of God, and who are the children of the devil: whoever does not practice righteousness is not of God, nor is the one who does not love his brother. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Who receives <b>the Holy Spirit</b>? The ones who obey God!
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Acts 5:32</b> - And we are witnesses to these things, and so is <b>he Holy Spirit</b>, whom God has given <span class="underline">to those who obey him</span>. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The Holy Spirit is received through faith:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Galatians 3:14</b> - so that in Christ Jesus the blessing of Abraham might come to the Gentiles, so that we might <b>receive the promised Spirit through faith</b>. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
We receive the spirit by getting Jesus' words into us, believing them and obeying them. Feeding on them, we get Jesus' spirit and life into us:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>John 6:63</b> - It is the Spirit who gives life; the flesh is of no avail. The words that I have spoken to you are spirit and life. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
So to receive the Holy Spirit:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Have faith in Jesus,
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>believe Jesus,</li>
<li>obey Jesus,</li>
</ul></li>

<h4 id="org58ed031"><span class="section-number-4">4.12.7.</span> The narrow gate vitally requires submitting to God's righteousness. We need God's forgiveness and His justification that comes through faith</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-4-12-7">
<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Romans 10:3</b> - For, being ignorant of the righteousness that comes from God, and seeking to establish their own, they did not submit to God's righteousness. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Like the following example of the tax collector, we must submit to God's righteousness:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Luke 18:9-14</b> - He also told this parable to some who trusted in themselves that they were righteous, and treated others with contempt: Two men went up into the temple to pray, one a Pharisee and the other a tax collector. The Pharisee, standing by himself, prayed thus: God, I thank you that I am not like other men, extortioners, unjust, adulterers, or even like this tax collector. I fast twice a week; I give tithes of all that I get. <span class="underline">But the tax collector, standing far off, would not even lift up his eyes to heaven, but beat his breast, saying, God, be merciful to me, a sinner! I tell you, this man went down to his house justified, rather than the other.</span> For everyone who exalts himself will be humbled, but the one who humbles himself will be exalted.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Jesus is the Lamb of God. We must accept God's forgiveness through faith in Jesus:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>John 1:29</b> - The next day he saw Jesus coming toward him, and said, Behold, <span class="underline">the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world!</span>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
God's righteousness is received by faith - through obedience to the gospel:
</p>

<blockquote>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><b>Romans 3:25</b> -  whom <span class="underline">God put forward as a propitiation by his blood, to be received by faith.  This was to show God's righteousness,</span> because in his divine forbearance he had passed over former sins.  (ESV)</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>
We must receive atonement for sin through faith.
</p>

<p>
The tax collector in the story above has an obedient and believing heart. The tax collector has faith. It's not our own righteousness which is sufficient, but Jesus Christ's righteousness imputed onto us when we are <b>in</b> Him. We must have faith in Jesus.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org18a276e" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="org18a276e"><span class="section-number-4">4.12.8.</span> We have to receive the Kingdom like a child. Don't resist Jesus or His teachings - follow Jesus</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-4-12-8">
<p>
I accept that I need Jesus to have mercy on me. Because my own righteousness isn't good enough. I want to obey Jesus for the rest of my life, and live for Him, and I trust Him because I believe His gospel. I know that <b>the Holy Spirit</b> goes to those who obey Him.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Luke 18:15-17</b> - Now they were bringing even infants to him that he might touch them. And when the disciples saw it, they rebuked them. But Jesus called them to him, saying, Let the children come to me, and do not hinder them, for to such belongs the kingdom of God. Truly, I say to you, whoever does not receive the kingdom of God like a child shall not enter it.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
And I'm still trusting and having faith in Jesus Christ even up until now. So while through obedience to Jesus we are saved, Jesus is still the source of that salvation:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Hebrews 5:9</b> - And being made perfect, he became the source of eternal salvation to <span class="underline">all who obey him,</span>
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>

<p>
We have to obey Jesus and take heed to all that He has said. Those who don't take heed to His words walk in darkness:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>John 3:19</b> - And this is the judgment: the light has come into the world, and people loved the darkness rather than the light because their deeds were evil.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Jesus is God's Son.
Jesus is the Lamb of God.
</p>

<p>
We must receive the redemption that is <b>in</b> Christ Jesus <span class="underline">through faith</span>:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Romans 3:22-25</b> - the righteousness of God through faith <span class="underline">(G4102 <b>pistis</b>) in Jesus Christ</span> for <span class="underline">all who believe (G4100 <b>pisteuo</b>).</span> For there is no distinction: for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God, and are justified by his grace as a gift, through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus, whom God displayed publicly as a propitiation in His blood through faith. This was to demonstrate His righteousness, because in the forbearance of God He passed over the sins previously committed;
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
All of these I believe belong under the umbrella of faith, not works:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Taking communion is not 'dead works'. It's obedience.</li>
<li>Getting baptised is not 'dead works'. It's obedience.</li>
<li>Obeying Jesus Christ's commandments are not 'dead works'. It's obedience.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Faith presses on to walk the same way Jesus walked:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Philippians 3:9-12</b> - and be found in him, not having a righteousness of my own that comes from the law, but <span class="underline">that which comes through faith in Christ, the righteousness from God that depends on faith</span> — that <span class="underline">I may know him and the power of his resurrection, and may share his sufferings, becoming like him in his death,</span> <span class="underline">that by any means possible I may attain the resurrection from the dead.</span> <span class="underline">Not that I have already obtained this or am already perfect, but I press on to make it my own,</span> because Christ Jesus has made me his own.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
God will be the judge of who has had faith in Jesus; who has obeyed Him and who has trusted in Him and who has made Him their Lord and who has accepted Him as their Saviour.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>John 12:48</b> - <span class="underline">The one who rejects me and does not receive my words has a judge</span>; the <span class="underline">word that I have spoken will judge him</span> on the last day.

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Hebrews 10:10-17</b> - And by that will we have been sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all. And every priest stands daily at his service, offering repeatedly the same sacrifices, which can never take away sins.

For by a single offering he has perfected for all time those who are being sanctified. And <b>the Holy Spirit</b> also bears witness to us; for after saying, This is the covenant that I will make with them after those days, declares the Lord: I will put my laws on their hearts, and write them on their minds, then he adds, I will remember their sins and their lawless deeds no more.

So Jesus said to them, Truly, truly, I say to you, the Son can do nothing of his own accord, but only what he sees the Father doing. For whatever the Father does, that the Son does likewise. For the Father loves the Son and shows him all that he himself is doing. And greater works than these will he show him, so that you may marvel. For as the Father raises the dead and gives them life, so also the Son gives life to whom he will. The Father judges no one, but has given all judgment to the Son, that all may honor the Son, just as they honor the Father. <span class="underline">Whoever does not honor the Son does not honor the Father who sent him.</span> Truly, truly, I say to you, <span class="underline">whoever hears my word and believes him who sent me has eternal life.

Jesus knows Father God, and Jesus keeps His word. Likewise, we must follow Jesus and keep <b>His</b> word. Jesus is obedient to Father God. We <b>must</b> be obedient to Jesus Christ:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>John 8:55-58</b> - But you have not known him. I know him. If I were to say that I do not know him, I would be a liar like you, but I do know him and I keep his word.

<p>
By posing the question, Jesus doesn't deny that he is good:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Mark 10:18</b> - And Jesus said to him, Why do you call me good? <span class="underline">No one is good except God alone.</span> (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
I believe there is only one good shepherd, and that is Jesus Christ, Immanuel (God with us, God incarnate, and not merely in the flesh, but the Word became flesh):
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>John 10:14-15</b> - <span class="underline">I am the good shepherd.</span> I know my own and my own know me, just as the Father knows me and I know the Father; and I lay down my life for the sheep. (ESV)

<p>
<b>John 1:14</b> - And the Word became flesh and dwelt among us, and we have seen his glory, glory as of the only Son from the Father, full of grace and truth. (ESV)

<p>
Jesus makes intercession for those who draw near to God through Him:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Hebrews 7:25</b> - Consequently, he is able to save to the uttermost those who draw near to God through him, since he always lives to make intercession for them.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Likewise, <b>the Holy Spirit</b> is Almighty God.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Isaiah 48:16-17</b> - Draw near to me, hear this: from the beginning I have not spoken in secret, from the time it came to be I have been there. And now the Lord GOD has sent me, and his Spirit. Thus says the LORD, your Redeemer, the Holy One of Israel: I am the LORD your God, who teaches you to profit, who leads you in the way you should go. (ESV)

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Matthew 3:16-17</b> - And when Jesus was baptized, immediately he went up from the water, and behold, the heavens were opened to him, and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove and coming to rest on him; and behold, a voice from heaven said, This is my beloved Son, with whom I am well pleased. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
This quite clearly shows that Jesus Christ is Almighty God:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Zechariah 12:10</b> - And I will pour out on the house of David and the inhabitants of Jerusalem a spirit of grace and pleas for mercy, so that, when they look on <b>me, on him whom they have pierced</b>, they shall <span class="underline">mourn for him, as one mourns for an only child,</span> and weep bitterly over him, <span class="underline">as one weeps over a firstborn.</span> (ESV)

<p>
I affirm the <a href="https://www.desiringgod.org/articles/what-is-the-doctrine-of-the-trinity">doctrine of the Trinity</a>:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Thus, the Son is not one-third of the being of God; he is all of the being of God. The Father is not one-third of the being of God; he is all of the being of God. And likewise with the Holy Spirit. Thus, as Wayne Grudem writes, “When we speak of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit together we are not speaking of any greater being than when we speak of the Father alone, the Son alone, or the Holy Spirit alone” (Ibid., 252).
</p>

<p>
There is only one God. If each Person of the Trinity is distinct and yet fully God, then should we conclude that there is more than one God? Obviously we cannot, for Scripture is clear that there is only one God: “There is no other God besides me, a righteous God and a Savior; there is none besides me. Turn to me and be saved, all the ends of the earth! For I am God, and there is no other”.

Jesus was with Father God in the beginning:

When there were no depths I was brought forth, when there were no springs abounding with water. Before the mountains had been shaped, before the hills, I was brought forth, before he had made the earth with its fields, or the first of the dust of the world. When he established the heavens, I was there; when he drew a circle on the face of the deep, when he made firm the skies above, when he established the fountains of the deep, when he assigned to the sea its limit, so that the waters might not transgress his command, when he marked out the foundations of the earth, then I was beside him, like a master workman, and I was daily his delight, rejoicing before him always, rejoicing in his inhabited world and delighting in the children of man. And now, O sons, listen to me: blessed are those who keep my ways. (ESV)

</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
God sends the Spirit of His Son into our heart, crying, "Abba! Father!" We experience this as our own cry. This is how we are given the assurance that we are the children of God:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Galatians 4:1-7</b> - I mean that the heir, as long as he is a child, is no different from a slave, though he is the owner of everything, but he is under guardians and managers until the date set by his father. In the same way we also, when we were children, were enslaved to the elementary principles of the world. But when the fullness of time had come, God sent forth his Son, born of woman, born under the law, to redeem those who were under the law, so that we might receive adoption as sons. And because you are sons, God has sent the Spirit of his Son into our hearts, crying, Abba! Father! So you are no longer a slave, but a son, and if a son, then an heir through God. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Romans 8:13-17</b> - For if you live according to the flesh you will die, but if by the Spirit you put to death the deeds of the body, you will live. For all who are led by the Spirit of God are sons of God. For you did not receive the spirit of slavery to fall back into fear, but you have received the Spirit of adoption as sons, by whom we cry, Abba! Father! The Spirit himself bears witness with our spirit that we are children of God, and if children, then heirs—heirs of God and fellow heirs with Christ, provided we suffer with him in order that we may also be glorified with him. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yENsZ-Fsj4I">The Spirit in Us Cries 'Abba Father': Galatians 4:1-7, Part 5 - YouTube</a>
</p>

<p>
I really want to hear the voice of the Holy Spirit cry 'Abba Father', and acknowledge that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>I John 4:1-3</b> - Beloved, do not believe every spirit, but test the spirits to see whether they are from God, for many false prophets have gone out into the world. By this you know the Spirit of God: every spirit that confesses that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is from God, and every spirit that does not confess Jesus is not from God. This is the spirit of the antichrist, which you heard was coming and now is in the world already. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
As of now (18 April '24), though, I have not actually heard that confession through the Spirit that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh - just being honest,
</p>

<p>
I still profess that Jesus Christ is the Only-Begotten Son of God who has proceeded from Father God, come from heaven to hearth in the flesh, born of the virgin Mary,
was crucified and died for the sins of mankind and raised from the dead on the third day and has ascended to the Father and sits at His right hand.
</p>

<p>
But I am still seeking hearing that acknowledgement by continuing in Jesus' word, endeavoring to keep Jesus' commandments. I certainly have heard many false and deceptive voices, even blasphemy.
So I mean, if the devil or evil spirits can speak lies to me then I just have total confidence that at the right time I'll hear from God.
Therefore, I will continue to endeavour to keep Jesus' commandments:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>John 14:21</b> - Whoever has my commandments and <b>keeps them</b>, <b>he it is who loves me</b>. And he who loves me will be loved by my Father, and I will love him and manifest myself to him. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
So it's really important that I remain faithful to Jesus and do my best to not compromise or be swayed by people who deter me from keeping Jesus' commandments.

If anyone else thinks he has reason for confidence in the flesh, I have more: circumcised on the eighth day, of the people of Israel, of the tribe of Benjamin, a Hebrew of Hebrews; as to the law, a Pharisee; as to zeal, a persecutor of the church; as to righteousness, under the law blameless.

For his sake I have suffered the loss of all things and count them as rubbish, in order that I may gain Christ and be found in him, not having a righteousness of my own that comes from the law, but that which comes through faith in Christ, the righteousness from God that depends on faith— that I may know him and the power of his resurrection, and may share his sufferings, becoming like him in his death, that by any means possible I may attain the resurrection from the dead.

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Know him and the power of His resurrection</li>
<li>Share His sufferings</li>
<li>Become like Him in His death</li>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Mark 12:30-31</b> - And you shall love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind and with all your strength. The second is this: You shall love your neighbor as yourself. There is no other commandment greater than these. (ESV)

And he said to him, Teacher, all these I have kept from my youth. And Jesus, looking at him, loved him, and said to him, You lack one thing: go, sell all that you have and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; and come, follow me. Disheartened by the saying, he went away sorrowful, for he had great possessions. And Jesus looked around and said to his disciples, How difficult it will be for those who have wealth to enter the kingdom of God! And the disciples were amazed at his words. But Jesus said to them again, Children, how difficult it is to enter the kingdom of God! It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich person to enter the kingdom of God. And they were exceedingly astonished, and said to him, Then who can be saved? Jesus looked at them and said, With man it is impossible, but not with God. For all things are possible with God. Peter began to say to him, See, we have left everything and followed you. Jesus said, Truly, I say to you, there is no one who has left house or brothers or sisters or mother or father or children or lands, for my sake and for the gospel, who will not receive a hundredfold now in this time, houses and brothers and sisters and mothers and children and lands, with persecutions, and in the age to come eternal life.

Through faith, <b>the Holy Spirit</b> cleanses us:

<p>
By <b>the Holy Spirit</b> washing and renewing us:

<p>
It's the will of God:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>

<p>
Our will must align to God's will:

<p>
Jesus' words speak for themselves:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>John 7:17</b> -  If anyone's will is to do God's will, he will know whether the teaching is from God or whether I am speaking on my own authority.  (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Paul echos this - a willing mind (readiness to obey). They gave themselves first to the Lord and then by God's will to us:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>II Corinthians 8:3-12</b> - For they gave according to their means, as I can testify, and beyond their means, <b>of their own free will</b>, begging us earnestly for the favor of taking part in the relief of the saints— and this, not as we expected, but <b>they gave themselves first to the Lord and then by the will of God to us</b>. Accordingly, we urged Titus that as he had started, so he should complete among you this act of grace. But as you excel in everything—in faith, in speech, in knowledge, in all earnestness, and in our love for you—see that you excel in this act of grace also. I say this not as a command, but to prove by the earnestness of others that your love also is genuine. For you know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that though he was rich, yet for your sake he became poor, so that you by his poverty might become rich. And in this matter I give my judgment: this benefits you, who a year ago started not only to do this work but also to desire to do it. So now finish doing it as well, so that your readiness in desiring it may be matched by your completing it out of what you have. For if the readiness is there, it is acceptable according to what a person has, not according to what he does not have. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
And doing the will of God is what it means to be led by the Spirit of God:

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-4-12-30">
<p>
We must look upon Jesus and stop sexual immorality and stop idolatry. The stories mentioned here are examples for us to follow:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>I Corinthians 10:1-7</b> - I want you to know, brothers, that our fathers were all under the cloud, and all passed through the sea, and all were baptized into Moses in the cloud and in the sea, and all ate the same spiritual food, and all drank the same spiritual drink. For they drank from the spiritual Rock that followed them, and the Rock was Christ. Nevertheless, <span class="underline">with most of them God was not pleased, for they were overthrown in the wilderness. Now these things took place as examples for us, that we might not desire evil as they did. Do not be idolaters as some of them were;</span> as it is written, The people sat down to eat and drink and rose up to play.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
We must take heed of this, because we don't want to <b>fall</b>:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>I Corinthians 10:8-13</b>- We must not indulge in sexual immorality as some of them did, and twenty-three thousand fell in a single day. We must not put Christ to the test, as some of them did and were destroyed by serpents, nor grumble, as some of them did and were destroyed by the Destroyer. Now these things happened to them as an example, but they were written down for our instruction, on whom the end of the ages has come. Therefore <span class="underline">let anyone who thinks that he stands take heed lest he fall.</span> No temptation has overtaken you that is not common to man. God is faithful, and he will not let you be tempted beyond your ability, but with the temptation he will also provide the way of escape, that you may be able to endure it.
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>II Peter 2:2-4</b> - And many will follow their sensuality, and because of them <span class="underline">the way of truth</span> will be blasphemed. And in their greed they will exploit you with false words. Their condemnation from long ago is not idle, and their destruction is not asleep. For if God did not spare angels when they sinned, but cast them into hell and committed them to chains of gloomy darkness to be kept until the judgment;
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>II Peter 2:19-20</b> - They promise them freedom, but they themselves are slaves of corruption. For <span class="underline">whatever overcomes a person, to that he is enslaved</span>. For if, after they have escaped the defilements of the world through the knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, they are again entangled in them and overcome, the last state has become worse for them than the first.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Therefore, the way of truth involves following Jesus and putting a stop to sin.

<p>
We must obey God. We have faith in God who was delivered up for our trespasses and raised for our justification, and having faith in God is having faith in His Son which is believing in and obeying Jesus Christ:

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Romans 4:23-25</b> - But the words it was counted to him were not written for his sake alone, but for ours also.

We should do what is valuable in stopping the indulgence of the flesh, and not what is invaluable from human precepts, but instead we should following Christ and His teachings, and His example of what love looks like:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Colossians 2:21-23</b> - Do not handle, Do not taste, Do not touch (referring to things that all perish as they are used)—according to human precepts and teachings? These have indeed an appearance of wisdom in promoting self-made religion and asceticism and severity to the body, but they are of no value in stopping the indulgence of the flesh.

<p>
Instead, let's follow Jesus Christ's teachings:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Colossians 3:1-4</b> - If then you have been raised with Christ, seek the things that are above, where Christ is, seated at the right hand of God. Set your minds on things that are above, not on things that are on earth. For you have died, and your life is hidden with Christ in God. When Christ who is your life appears, then you also will appear with him in glory.

<p>
If people including free-grace Christians do not repent from sin, they will still be repaid impartially, and on account of sinful things the wrath of God comes. We have to put to death sin:

But now you <b>must</b> put them all away: anger, wrath, malice, slander, and obscene talk from your mouth.

Let us hold fast the confession of our hope without wavering, for he who promised is faithful. And let us consider how to stir up one another to love and good works, not neglecting to meet together, as is the habit of some, but encouraging one another, and all the more as you see the Day drawing near. For if we go on sinning deliberately after receiving the knowledge of the truth, there no longer remains a sacrifice for sins, but a fearful expectation of judgment, and a fury of fire that will consume the adversaries.

<b>Romans 10:8-9</b> - But what does it say? “The word is near you, in your mouth and in your heart”&#x2013; that is, the word (G4487 rhema) of faith (G4102 pistis) which we are preaching, that if you confess (G3670 homologeo) with your mouth Jesus as Lord, and <span class="underline">believe (G4100 <b>pisteuo</b>) in your heart</span> (G2588 kardia) that God raised Him from the dead, you will be saved; (NASB)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
It's faith in the heart which we need; obedience to Jesus Christ and belief in Jesus Christ in the heart, and belief and obedience to God who has <span class="underline">raised from the dead Jesus our Lord, who was delivered up for our trespasses and raised for our justification</span>.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>John 7:17</b> -  If anyone's will is to do God's will, he will know whether the teaching is from God or whether I am speaking on my own authority.  (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Jesus has been perfectly obedient, so Jesus speaks what Father God speaks, and when someone seeks Jesus Christ, they see Father God, because Father God has been revealed to us in Jesus Christ. The Father is in the Son. The Word is God.
</p>

<p>
Also, through perfect obedience, Jesus has spoken Father God's commandment of eternal life, which is what He has said:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>"<sub>the</sub> Father who sent me has himself given me a commandment—what to say and what to speak._"</li>
</ul>

<p>
Whoever has faith in Jesus, has faith in God. Whoever sees Jesus sees the Father:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>John 12:44-48</b> - And Jesus cried out and said, <span class="underline">Whoever believes in me, believes not in me but in him who sent me. And whoever sees me sees him who sent me.</span> <span class="underline">I have come into the world as light, so that whoever believes in me may not remain in darkness.</span> If anyone hears my words and does not keep them, I do not judge him; for I did not come to judge the world but to save the world. The one who rejects me and does not receive my words has a judge; the word that I have spoken will judge him on the last day.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Jesus' words bring eternal life. The commandment which Father God gave Jesus is eternal life and the commandment is the words that Jesus Christ has spoken, so we need to abide in Jesus Christ by letting His words abide in us, believing Him and obeying Him; doing what He said:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>John 12:49-50</b>- For I have not spoken on my own authority, but <span class="underline">the Father who sent me has himself given me a commandment—what to say and what to speak.</span> And I know that <span class="underline">his commandment is eternal life. What I say, therefore, I say as the Father has told me.</span>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Jesus has the words of eternal life.
</p>

<p>
We need to obey Jesus Christ and walk and believe as God has commanded and spoken through Jesus:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>John 14:6-11</b> - Jesus said to him, I am the way, and the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me. If you had known me, you would have known my Father also. From now on you do know him and have seen him. Philip said to him, Lord, show us the Father, and it is enough for us. Jesus said to him, Have I been with you so long, and you still do not know me, Philip? Whoever has seen me has seen the Father. How can you say, Show us the Father? Do you not believe that I am in the Father and the Father is in me? The words that I say to you I do not speak on my own authority, but the Father who dwells in me does his works. Believe me that I am in the Father and the Father is in me, or else believe on account of the works themselves.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
We must believe Jesus, and have faith in Jesus Christ, obeying Jesus, and that is obeying God and having faith in God:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>John 7:17</b> -  If anyone's will is to do God's will, he will know whether the teaching is from God or whether I am speaking on my own authority.  (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Therefore, to arrive at the knowledge of the truth, you've got to have an obedient heart.
</p>

<p>
How can they call on Him whom they have not had faith in?
</p>

<p>
How will they have faith in Him whom they have not heard?
</p>

<p>
How will they hear without a preacher?
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Romans 10:14-15</b>- But how are they to call on him in whom they have not believed? And how are they to believe in him of whom they have never heard? And how are they to hear without someone preaching? And how are they to preach unless they are sent? As it is written, How beautiful are the feet of those who preach the good news!

<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-4-12-35-1">
<p>
I think baptism of water is an <b>appeal</b> to God and identifying oneself into Christ's death and resurrection but the sacrament <b>maybe</b> is not strictly required to be saved (as far as I understand).
</p>

<p>
To be baptised is an act of obedience.
</p>

<p>
I definitely believe that "believer's baptism" is the right way to perform baptism.
Baptism does save.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Romans 6:3-4</b> - Do you not know that all of us who have been baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into his death? We were buried therefore with him by baptism into death, in order that, just as Christ was raised from the dead by the glory of the Father, we too might walk in newness of life. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>I Peter 3:18-21</b> - For Christ also suffered once for sins, the righteous for the unrighteous, that he might bring us to God, being put to <b>death in the flesh but made alive in the spirit</b>, in which he went and proclaimed to the spirits in prison, because <b>they formerly did not obey</b>, when God's patience waited in the days of Noah, while the ark was being prepared, in which a few, that is, eight persons, were brought safely through water. Baptism, which corresponds to this, now saves you, not as a removal of dirt from the body but as an appeal to God for a good conscience, through the resurrection of Jesus Christ,

<p>
Even after Jesus has come, the fear of the Lord is still important in getting God's attention. We still must obey God by obeying Jesus:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Psalms 34:11-22</b> - Come, O children, listen to me; I will teach you the <span class="underline">fear of the Lord</span>. What man is there who desires life and loves many days, that he may see good? Keep your tongue from evil and your lips from speaking deceit. Turn away from evil and do good; seek peace and pursue it. <span class="underline">The eyes of the Lord are toward the righteous and his ears toward their cry</span>. The face of the Lord is against those who do evil, to cut off the memory of them from the earth. When the righteous cry for help, the Lord hears and delivers them out of all their troubles. The Lord is near to the brokenhearted and saves the crushed in spirit. Many are the afflictions of the righteous, but the Lord delivers him out of them all. He keeps all his bones; not one of them is broken. Affliction will slay the wicked, and those who hate the righteous will be condemned. The Lord redeems the life of his servants; none of those who take refuge in him will be condemned.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
We make it our aim to please him:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>II Corinthians 5:9-12</b> - So whether we are at home or away, we make it our aim to please him. For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ, so that each one may receive what is due for what he has done in the body, whether good or evil. Therefore, knowing the <span class="underline">fear of the Lord</span>, we persuade others. But what we are is known to God, and I hope it is known also to your conscience. We are not commending ourselves to you again but giving you cause to boast about us, so that you may be able to answer those who boast about outward appearance and not about what is in the heart.

<h4 id="org492be1f"><span class="section-number-4">4.14.1.</span> Justification by having faith like Abraham in He who raised Jesus Christ from the dead</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-4-14-1">
<p>
Paul the Apostle met James, brother of Jesus:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Galatians 1:15-20</b>- But when he who had set me apart before I was born, and who called me by his grace, was pleased to reveal his Son to me, in order that I might preach him among the Gentiles, I did not immediately consult with anyone; nor did I go up to Jerusalem to those who were apostles before me, but I went away into Arabia, and returned again to Damascus. Then after three years I went up to Jerusalem to visit Cephas and remained with him fifteen days. But I saw none of the other apostles except James the Lord's brother. (In what I am writing to you, before God, I do not lie! )
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Interestingly, James believes that a person is justified not by faith alone, but by works of faith:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>James 2:21-24</b> - Was not Abraham our father justified by works when he offered up Isaac his son on the altar? You see that faith was working with his works, and as a result of the works, faith was perfected; and the Scripture was fulfilled which says, “And Abraham believed God, and it was reckoned to him as righteousness,” and he was called the friend of God. You see that a man is justified by works and not by faith alone.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Fear-of-God:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Romans 4:5-8</b> - And to the one who does not work but trusts him who justifies the ungodly, his faith is counted as righteousness, just as David also speaks of the blessing of the one to whom God counts righteousness apart from works: Blessed are those whose lawless deeds are forgiven, and whose sins are covered; blessed is the man against whom the Lord will not count his sin.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
AMEN!! But this doesn't mean the other elements of working faith can't play a part.
</p>

<p>
We may rest from our labors when we die in the Lord:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Revelation of John 14:13</b> - And I heard a voice from heaven saying, Write this: Blessed are the dead who die in the Lord from now on. Blessed indeed, says the Spirit, that they may rest from their labors, for their deeds follow them! (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Circumcision of the flesh does not matter:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Romans 4:9-12</b> - Is this blessing then only for the circumcised, or also for the uncircumcised? We say that faith was counted to Abraham as righteousness. How then was it counted to him? Was it before or after he had been circumcised? It was not after, but before he was circumcised. He received the sign of circumcision as a seal of the righteousness that he had by faith while he was still uncircumcised. The purpose was to make him the father of all who believe (G4100 pisteuo) without being circumcised, so that righteousness would be counted to them as well, and to make him the father of the circumcised who are not merely circumcised but who also walk in the footsteps of the faith that our father Abraham had before he was circumcised.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
We must share the faith of Abraham to receive the grace:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Romans 4:13-17</b> - For the promise to Abraham and his offspring that he would be heir of the world did not come through the law but through the righteousness of faith. For if it is the adherents of the law who are to be the heirs, faith is null and the promise is void. For the law brings wrath, but where there is no law there is no transgression. That is why it depends on faith, in order that the promise may rest on grace and be guaranteed to all his offspring—not only to the adherent of the law but also to the one who shares the faith of Abraham, who is the father of us all, as it is written, I have made you the father of many nations—in the presence of the God in whom he believed, who gives life to the dead and calls into existence the things that do not exist.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
In hope, Abraham believed against hope. He didn't weaken in faith, even when it seemed impossible.
He trusted and believed God, and grew strong in his faith and gave glory to God. <span class="underline">We should do the same.</span>
</p>

<p>
We must believe on Him (God) who raised Jesus from the dead, with the faith that Abraham had - Abraham's faith was working, but it wasn't the works that justified Him, it was the faith.
</p>

<p>
If a person lives their life as a living sacrifice to honour and serve Jesus Christ, which is honouring and having faith in God, then all of that is analogous to Abraham's works of faith.
</p>

<p>
We must trust God in hope against hope, and not weaken in faith, and trust God's promise, and honour Jesus Christ with our lives - that is what I believe.
</p>

<p>
The most important thing is this faith - but God certainly uses our works of faith:
</p>

<p>
Our salvation comes from faith alone in God for the promise of forgiveness from sin and hope of eternal life with Christ Jesus for those who believe in God who raised Jesus Christ from the dead, our Lord, who was delivered up for our trespasses and raised for our justification.
</p>

<p>
It's because of what Jesus Christ has done that we are justified, not because of anything we have done. We must trust in God to justify us we hold to our faith.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Romans 4:18-25</b> - <span class="underline">In hope he believed (G4100 pisteuo) against hope</span>, that he should become the father of many nations, as he had been told, So shall your offspring be. He did not weaken in faith when he considered his own body, which was as good as dead (since he was about a hundred years old), or when he considered the barrenness of Sarah's womb. No distrust made him waver concerning the promise of God, but he grew strong in his faith as he gave glory to God, fully convinced that God was able to do what he had promised. That is why his faith was counted to him as righteousness. But the words it was counted to him were not written for his sake alone, but for ours also. <span class="underline">It will be counted to us who believe (G4100 pisteuo) in him who raised from the dead Jesus our Lord, who was delivered up for our trespasses and raised for our justification.</span>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Therefore, do not put your hope on how little faith you can have for Jesus Christ to scrape through (because Jesus Christ is the judge), but instead live for Him sincerely, doing as He has instructed us.
</p>

<p>
To follow and obey Jesus Christ with the same type of faith that Abraham had - that is what we should be doing - that's saving faith, I think. Our justification is based on what Jesus Christ has done.
</p>

<p>
Now as we live by faith, we are justified by this faith and have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ who we are <span class="underline">believing, following, obeying and honouring.</span>
</p>

<p>
And we only have access to the grace if we have faith:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Romans 5:1-2</b> - Therefore, since we have been justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ. Through him we have also obtained access by faith into this grace in which we stand, and we rejoice in hope of the glory of God.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Faith involves obeying Jesus Christ:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>I John 2:3</b> - And by this we know that we have come to know him, if we keep his commandments.
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>I John 5:3-4</b> - For this is the love of God, that we keep his commandments. And his commandments are not burdensome. For everyone who has been born of God overcomes the world. And this is the victory that has overcome the world—our faith.
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Acts 5:32</b> - And we are witnesses to these things, and so is <b>he Holy Spirit</b>, whom God has given <span class="underline">to those who obey him</span>. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Galatians 3:14</b> - so that in Christ Jesus the blessing of Abraham might come to the Gentiles, so that we might <b>receive the promised Spirit through faith</b>. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Jesus says you must obey God to be part of His family:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Luke 8:21</b> - But He answered and said to them, “My mother and My brothers are these who hear the word of God and do it.”
</p>
</blockquote>

Jesus implies you must obey Him (Jesus) to be part of His family:

And when they saw it, they all grumbled, He has gone in to be the guest of a man who is a sinner. And Zacchaeus stood and said to the Lord, Behold, Lord, the half of my goods I give to the poor.

<b>John 3:36</b> - Whoever believes (G4100 <b>pisteuo</b>) in the Son has eternal life; whoever does not <b>obey</b> the Son shall not see life, but the wrath of God remains on him. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
We must obey God. We have faith in God who was delivered up for our trespasses and raised for our justification, and having faith in God is having faith in His Son which is believing in and obeying Jesus Christ:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Romans 4:23-25</b> - But the words it was counted to him were not written for his sake alone, but for ours also. It will be counted to us who believe (G4100 <b>pisteuo</b>) in him who raised from the dead Jesus our Lord, who was delivered up for our trespasses and raised for our justification. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
<code>pisteuo</code> is the faith verb.
</p>

<p>
So the promise is for all who put their faith in God by obeying Jesus Christ with the faith of Abraham to a greater or lesser degree.

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-4-17-1">
<p>
If we are led by the spirit then we are not under the Mosaic law. So we should stop sinning as it is described by such works of the flesh as listed:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Galatians 5:18</b> - But <b>if</b> you are led by the Spirit, you are not under the law. Now the works of the flesh are evident: sexual immorality, impurity, sensuality, idolatry, sorcery, enmity, strife, jealousy, fits of anger, rivalries, dissensions, divisions, envy, drunkenness, orgies, and things like these. I warn you, as I warned you before, that those who do such things will not inherit the kingdom of God.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The law (Mosaic law) is laid down for those who are lawless and disobedient!:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>I Timothy 1:9</b> - understanding this, that the law is not laid down for the just but for the lawless and disobedient, for the ungodly and sinners, for the unholy and profane, for those who strike their fathers and mothers, for murderers, (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Sin is lawlessness:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>I John 3:4</b> - Everyone who makes a practice of sinning also practices lawlessness; sin is lawlessness. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
We are under Christ's law, not the Mosaic law:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>I Corinthians 9:21</b> - To those outside the law I became as one outside the law (not being outside the law of God but <span class="underline">under the law of Christ</span>) that I might win those outside the law.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
<b>In His flesh</b> the emnity, which is the Law of commandments contained in ordinances is abolished:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Ephesians 2:14-16</b> - For He Himself is our peace, who made both groups into one and broke down the barrier of the dividing wall, by <b>abolishing in His flesh the enmity, which is the Law of commandments contained in ordinances</b>, so that in Himself He might make the two into one new man, thus establishing peace, and might reconcile them both in one body to God through the cross, by it having put to death the enmity. (NASB)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Instead of being under the law, we seek to live for Christ, and follow Christ's teaching:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Galatians 6:12</b> - It is those who want to make a good showing in the flesh who would force you to be circumcised, and only in order that they may not be persecuted for the cross of Christ. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Within Christ there is peace:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Galatians 5:13</b> - For you were called to freedom, brothers. Only do not use your freedom as an opportunity for the flesh, but through love serve one another. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
We follow Jesus and obey His commandments:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Galatians 5:14</b> - For the whole law is fulfilled in one word: You shall love your neighbor as yourself. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Galatians 6:2</b> - Bear one another's burdens, and so fulfill the law of Christ. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
We must feed on His flesh to abide in Him:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>John 6:53</b> - So Jesus said to them, Truly, truly, I say to you, unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink his blood, you have no life in you. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>John 6:55-56</b> - For my flesh is true food, and my blood is true drink. Whoever feeds on my flesh and drinks my blood abides in me, and I in him. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Jesus' flesh is the way into the holy places:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Hebrews 10:19-20</b> - Therefore, brothers, since we have confidence to enter the holy places by the blood of Jesus, by the new and living way that he opened for us through the curtain, that is, through his flesh, (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Jesus suffered in the flesh, and we should too, and stop sinning:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>I Peter 4:1</b> - Since therefore Christ suffered in the flesh, arm yourselves with the same way of thinking, for whoever has suffered in the flesh has ceased from sin, (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Colossians 1:24</b> - Now I rejoice in my sufferings for your sake, and in my flesh I am filling up what is lacking in Christ's afflictions for the sake of his body, that is, the church, (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
We're justified by our faith in Christ. We simply follow Jesus:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Galatians 5:4</b> - You are severed from Christ, you who would be justified by the law; you have fallen away from grace. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
There are lawless spirits (spirits which work things like idolatry, and falsehood; anything which is against the truth):
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>II Thessalonians 2:7-13</b> - For the mystery of lawlessness is already at work. Only he who now restrains it will do so until he is out of the way. And then the lawless one will be revealed, whom the Lord Jesus will kill with the breath of his mouth and bring to nothing by the appearance of his coming. The coming of the lawless one is by the activity of Satan with all power and false signs and wonders, and with all wicked deception for those who are perishing, because they refused to love the truth and so be saved. Therefore God sends them a strong delusion, so that they may believe what is false, in order that all may be condemned who did not believe the truth but had pleasure in unrighteousness. But we ought always to give thanks to God for you, brothers beloved by the Lord, because God chose you as the firstfruits to be saved, through sanctification by the Spirit and belief in the truth. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Lawlessness includes idolatry:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>I Peter 4:3</b> - The time that is past suffices for doing what the Gentiles want to do, living in sensuality, passions, drunkenness, orgies, drinking parties, and lawless idolatry. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
If idolatry is lawlessness then so is falsely witnessing, so is sexual immorality, adultery, murder/hate, etc. And the Apostles in the New Testament and Jesus, and the Bible generally testifies that we must stop being lawless!
</p>

<p>
Lawlessness includes hate/murder:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Matthew 24:10-13</b> - And then <b>many will fall away and betray one another and hate one another.</b> And many false prophets will arise and lead many astray. And because lawlessness will be increased, the love of many will grow cold. But the one who endures to the end will be saved. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
We are commanded by Paul the Apostle to present our members as <b>slaves to righteousness</b> leading to sanctification - that's called repentance from sin, folks!:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Romans 6:19</b> - I am speaking in human terms, because of your natural limitations. For just as you once presented your members as slaves to impurity and to lawlessness leading to more lawlessness, so now present your members as slaves to righteousness leading to sanctification. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
We were purchased with the precious blood of Jesus Christ and we are supposed to be changed and purified to no longer being lawless!
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Titus 2:14</b> - who gave himself for us to redeem us from all lawlessness and to purify for himself a people for his own possession who are zealous for good works. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
We must not allow ourselves to be conformed to or carried away by the error of lawless people. The error is their lawlessness:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>II Peter 3:17</b> - You therefore, beloved, knowing this beforehand, take care that you are not carried away with the error of lawless people and lose your own stability. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
We must follow Jesus, and obey Jesus and stop sinning!
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Matthew 7:21-24</b> - Not everyone who says to me, Lord, Lord, will enter the kingdom of heaven, but <b>the one who does the will of my Father who is in heaven</b>. On that day many will say to me, Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in your name, and cast out demons in your name, and do many mighty works in your name? And then will I declare to them, I never knew you; depart from me, you <span class="underline">workers of lawlessness</span>. <span class="underline">Everyone then who hears these words of mine</span> <b>and does them</b> <span class="underline">will be like a wise man who built his house on the rock</span>. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Part of the will of Father God is that we repent from sin:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>I Thessalonians 4:3-7</b> - For this is the will of God, your sanctification: that you abstain from sexual immorality; that each one of you know how to control his own body in holiness and honor, not in the passion of lust like the Gentiles who do not know God; that no one transgress and wrong his brother in this matter, because the Lord is an avenger in all these things, as we told you beforehand and solemnly warned you. For God has not called us for impurity, but in holiness. (ESV)

For I think that God has exhibited us apostles as last of all, like men sentenced to death, because we have become a spectacle to the world, to angels, and to men. We are fools for Christ's sake, but you are wise in Christ. We are weak, but you are strong. You are held in honor, but we in disrepute.

I do not write these things to make you ashamed, but to admonish you as my beloved children. For though you have countless guides in Christ, you do not have many fathers.

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>John 17:15-17</b> - I do not ask that you take them out of the world, but that you keep them from the evil one. They are not of the world, just as I am not of the world. Sanctify them in the truth; your word is truth.

Jesus wants us to do God's will, and love Him and be obedient to Him:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>John 8:41-44</b> - You are doing what your father did. They said to him, We were not born of sexual immorality. We have one Father—even God. Jesus said to them, If God were your Father, you would <b>love me</b>, for I came from God and I am here. I came not of my own accord, but he sent me. Why do you not understand what I say? It is because you cannot bear to hear my word. You are of your father the devil, and your will is to do your father's desires. He was a murderer from the beginning, and has nothing to do with the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he lies, he speaks out of his own character, for he is a liar and the father of lies.

<p>
God has common grace for evildoers, and for the unjust, and Jesus wants us to help work that common grace into the lives of other people:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Matthew 5:44-45</b> - But I say to you, Love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you, so that you may be sons of your Father who is in heaven. For he makes his sun rise on the evil and on the good, and sends rain on the just and on the unjust. (ESV)

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Luke 6:35-36</b> - But love your enemies, and do good, and <b>lend, expecting nothing in return,</b> and your reward will be great, <span class="underline">and you will be sons of the Most High,</span> for he is kind to the ungrateful and the evil.

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Galatians 3:24</b> - So then, the law was our guardian until Christ came, in order that we might be justified by faith. (ESV)

<p>
We have to have faith which is characteristic of Abraham's faith, but with regards to following the Lord Jesus.
</p>

<p>
Our justification comes from having trusting faith in God our Father, who has raised from the dead Jesus Christ
our <b>Lord</b> (our brother who we obey); the Jesus Christ who
was delivered up for our trespasses and raised
from the dead for our justification.
</p>

<p>
Obeying God is obeying Jesus. Having faith in God is having faith in Jesus.
</p>

<p>
He was raised <b>for</b> our justification; now in order to be justified by faith, we simply need to put our faith in Him and follow Him.
</p>

<p>
We have to die to our old self and live for Christ, simply abiding in Him.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>II Corinthians 5:14-15</b> - For the love of Christ controls us, because we have concluded this: that one has died for all, therefore all have died; and he died for all, that <span class="underline">those who live might no longer live for themselves but for him who for their sake died and was raised.</span>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
If we walk in the footsteps of the faith that our father Abraham had before he was circumcised, but having faith in God by obeying Jesus Christ who was raised for our justification then we have Jesus Christ's righteousness; we have the righteeousness of faith in God.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Romans 4:22-23</b> - That is why his faith was counted to him as righteousness. But <span class="underline">the words it was counted to him were not written for his sake alone,</span> (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
And the promise will be ours also, because Jesus is our Lord, and we belong to Him.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Romans 4:24-25</b> - but for ours also. It will be counted to us who believe in him who <span class="underline">raised from the dead Jesus our Lord,</span> who was delivered up for our trespasses and raised for our justification. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Romans 4:9-12</b> - Is this blessing then only for the circumcised, or also for the uncircumcised? We say that faith was counted to Abraham as righteousness. How then was it counted to him? Was it before or after he had been circumcised? It was not after, but before he was circumcised. He received the sign of circumcision as a seal of the righteousness that he had by faith while he was still uncircumcised. The purpose was to make him the father of all who believe without being circumcised, so that righteousness would be counted to them as well, and to make him the father of the circumcised who are <span class="underline">not merely circumcised but who also walk in the footsteps of the faith that our father Abraham had before he was circumcised</span>.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
So what Jesus is saying is quite similar - we must have the faith that Abraham had when he put Isaac on the Altar, but in regards to following Jesus. We must give up our old life to live for Christ:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Luke 9:23-24</b> - And he said to all, If anyone would come after me, let him deny himself and take up his cross daily and follow me. For whoever would save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for my sake will save it. (ESV)

We are sanctified by the Father in the way that Jesus was made perfect.
We are made perfect the same way He was made perfect, by the sufferings that come through obedience to God's will.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Hebrews 2:10-11</b> - For it was fitting that he, for whom and by whom all things exist, in bringing many sons to glory, should make the founder of their salvation perfect through suffering. For he who sanctifies and those who are sanctified all have one origin. That is why he is not ashamed to call them brothers, (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Matthew 26:39-42</b> - And going a little farther he fell on his face and prayed, saying, My Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me; nevertheless, not as I will, but as you will. And he came to the disciples and found them sleeping. And he said to Peter, So, could you not watch with me one hour? Watch and pray that you may not enter into temptation. The spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak. Again, for the second time, he went away and prayed, My Father, if this cannot pass unless I drink it, your will be done. (ESV)

<p>
Thee same way Jesus went is the Way, the new and living way, the Jesus way:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Hebrews 5:8-9</b> - Although he was a son, he learned obedience through what he suffered. And being made perfect, he became the source of eternal salvation to all who obey him, (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Receiving this is a mixture of belief and obedience towards Jesus.
Faith is a mixture of belief and obedience.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>I Peter 2:21</b> - For to this you have been called, because Christ also suffered for you, <span class="underline">leaving you an example, so that you might follow in his steps.</span> (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Obedience to God is an act of faith: (<b>Hebrews 11</b>). On the flip side, disobedience flows from unbelief/faithlessness:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>I Timothy 1:13</b> - though formerly I was a blasphemer, persecutor, and insolent opponent. But I received mercy because I had acted ignorantly in unbelief, (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Acting in accordance with faithlessness is sinful behaviour:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>1Ti 1:13</b> - even though I was formerly a blasphemer and a persecutor and a violent aggressor. Yet I was shown mercy because I <b>acted</b> (G4160 poieo) <b>ignorantly</b> (G50 agnoeo) in <b>unbelief</b> (G570 apaistia, faithlessness, disobedience);

The wrath of God comes upon the sons of disobedience:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Ephesians 5:5-7</b> - For you may be sure of this, that everyone who is sexually immoral or impure, or who is covetous (that is, an idolater), has no inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and God. Let no one deceive you with empty words, for because of these things <span class="underline">the wrath of God comes upon the sons of disobedience.</span> Therefore do not associate with them;
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
That means that justifying faith involves obeying Jesus:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Romans 5:8-11</b> - but God shows his love for us in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us. Since, therefore, we have now been justified by his blood, much more shall we be saved by him from the wrath of God. For if while we were enemies we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son, much more, <span class="underline">now that we are reconciled, shall we be saved by his life.</span> More than that, we also rejoice in God through <span class="underline">our Lord</span> Jesus Christ, through whom we have now received reconciliation.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The free gift of justification is <b>received through faith</b>.
</p>

<p>
And I believe we need an obedient heart towards Jesus to receive.
</p>

<p>
It's not about obedience to the law but about obeying Jesus / loving Jesus / trusting Jesus.
</p>

<p>
The justifying work is finished - Jesus finished it, now we follow Him through the same way he went, by obeying Him.
</p>

<p>
Now we need faith to receive it and I believe
that faith necessitates love for Jesus, which
includes obedience to Jesus, and it's the
heart that matters most, because all the work
may be burned up but we are still saved,
because it's not the work that saves, it's
faith, but I believe that faith necessitates
love/obedience to Jesus, as one of His sheep.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Romans 3:21-25</b> - But now the righteousness of God has been manifested apart from the law, although the Law and the Prophets bear witness to it— the righteousness of God through faith in Jesus Christ for all who believe. For there is no distinction: for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God, and are justified by his grace as a gift, through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus, whom God put forward as a propitiation by his blood, to be <b>received by faith</b>. This was to show God's righteousness, because in his divine forbearance he had passed over former sins. (ESV)

Relying on the 'works of the law' for one's righteousness puts a person under a curse:
</p>

<blockquote>

I think it's important to live righteously out of love for God and one's neighbour, and out of faith.
</p>

<p>
That being said, I think God does justify through faith, and I believe faith works. And working may indeed be called faith if the work is done in faith.
I also think God likely saves through works because it may be their way of demonstrating faith to Jesus.

<p>
Through faith we are justified, but we should absolutely stop sinning
</p>

<p>
We are sanctified by the Spirit <b>and</b> faith in the truth (taking God's words as True and using them to combat lies):
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>II Thessalonians 2:13</b> - But we should always give thanks (G2168 eucharisteo) to God for you, brethren beloved by the Lord, because God has chosen you from the beginning (G746 arche) for salvation through sanctification by the Spirit <b>and</b> faith (G4102 <b>pistis</b>) in the truth (G225 aletheia). (NASB)
</p>
</blockquote>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>And the Spirit is the Truth</li>
<li>And God's Word is Truth
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>God's Words are Truth</li>
<li>Jesus is the Truth</li>
</ul></li>
<li>We must have faith in the truth (i.e. believe and trust in the truth)</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Deuteronomy 13:4</b> - You shall walk after the Lord your God and fear him and keep his commandments and obey his voice, and you shall serve him and hold fast to him.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Think of Jesus here:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><span class="underline">keep His commandments</span></li>
<li><span class="underline">obey His voice</span></li>
<li><span class="underline">serve Him</span></li>
<li><span class="underline">hold fast to Him</span></li>
</ul>

<p>
Christians must do this.
</p>

<p>
It's Jesus' words are forever true:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Matthew 24:35</b> - Heaven and earth will pass away, but <span class="underline">my words will not pass away.</span> (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
We will be judged by Jesus' own words which God gave Him, unless we accept Him, and accept His words:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>John 12:48</b> - <span class="underline">The one who rejects me and does not receive my words has a judge</span>; the <span class="underline">word that I have spoken will judge him</span> on the last day.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
I believe the following indicates the law exists pretty much forever - there probably isn't an expiry date:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Luke 16:17</b> - But it is easier for heaven and earth to pass away than for one dot of the Law to become void.
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Psalms 119:160</b> - The sum of your word is truth, and every one of your righteous rules endures forever. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>John 17:17-19</b> - Sanctify them in the truth; Your word is truth. As you sent me into the world, so I have sent them into the world. And for their sake I consecrate myself, that they also may be sanctified in truth.  (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Those who are in the faith <span class="underline">can't do anything against the truth</span>.
</p>

<p>
I think the Apostle here understands that we must test ourselves to see if we are in the faith, and encourage others to test themselves.
But interestingly, he says, "not that we may appear to have met the test", and "though we may seem to have failed", as if it may <b>appear</b> and <b>seem</b> as
though others have failed, but that we should <b>test ourselves</b>.
</p>

<p>
Though there may seem to be <b>apparent</b> paradoxes, and <b>apparent</b> contradictions in the Scripture, I think they either resolve or we rest in God, not relying on our own understanding. But I confidently affirm God is True, though I don't understand everything, and I affirm that my spiritual eyesight is getting cleaned up by the Spirit, through faith, and by the washing of the word, and I have confidence that Jesus Christ is in me:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>II Corinthians 13:5-8</b> - Examine yourselves, to see whether you are in the faith. Test yourselves. Or do you not realize this about yourselves, that Jesus Christ is in you? —unless indeed you fail to meet the test! I hope you will find out that we have not failed the test. But we pray to God that you may not do wrong—not that we may appear to have met the test, but that you may do what is right, though we may seem to have failed. For we cannot do anything against the truth, but only for the truth.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Because truth is truth, it is imperishable:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>I Peter 1:23-25</b> - since you have been born again, not of perishable seed but of imperishable, through the living and abiding word of God; for All flesh is like grass and all its glory like the flower of grass. The grass withers, and the flower falls, but the word of the Lord remains forever. And this word is the good news that was preached to you. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>I Corinthians 15:51-58</b> - Behold! I tell you a mystery. We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed, in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trumpet. For the trumpet will sound, and the dead will be raised imperishable, and we shall be changed. For this perishable body must put on the imperishable, and this mortal body must put on immortality. When the perishable puts on the imperishable, and the mortal puts on immortality, then shall come to pass the saying that is written: Death is swallowed up in victory. O death, where is your victory? O death, where is your sting? The sting of death is sin, and the power of sin is the law. But thanks be to God, who gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ. Therefore, my beloved brothers, be steadfast, immovable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, knowing that in the Lord your labor is not in vain. (ESV)
</p>

<p>
Stop sinning by faith in the truth - by faith in Jesus, and trusting obedience in God's words:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>1 Thessalonians 4:3</b> -  For this is the will of God, your sanctification: that you <span class="underline">abstain</span> from sexual immorality;  (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Mark 10:19</b> - You know the commandments: Do not murder, Do not commit adultery, Do not steal, Do not bear false witness, Do not defraud, Honor your father and mother. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>1 John 3:4-9</b> - Everyone who makes a practice of sinning also practices lawlessness; sin is lawlessness.  You know that he appeared to take away sins, and in him there is no sin.  No one who abides in him keeps on sinning; no one who keeps on sinning has either seen him or known him.  Little children, let no one deceive you.  Whoever practices righteousness is righteous, as he is righteous.  Whoever makes a practice of sinning is of the devil, for the devil has been sinning from the beginning.  The reason the Son of God appeared was to destroy the works of the devil.  No one born of God makes a practice of sinning, for God's seed abides in him, and he cannot keep on sinning because he has been born of God.  (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Jesus' words will not pass away:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Matthew 24:35</b> - Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will not pass away.  (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>John 6:68</b> -  Simon Peter answered him, Lord, to whom shall we go?  You have the words of eternal life,  (ESV)

</blockquote>

<p>
Adhering strictly to the Mosaic law is not needed to be justified by God if we believe in and follow Jesus:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Galatians 3:15-18</b> - To give a human example, brothers: even with a man-made covenant, no one annuls it or adds to it once it has been ratified. Now the promises were made to Abraham and to his offspring. It does not say, And to offsprings, referring to many, but referring to one, And to your offspring, who is Christ. This is what I mean: the law, which came 430 years afterward, does not annul a covenant previously ratified by God, so as to make the promise void. For if the inheritance comes by the law, it no longer comes by promise; but God gave it to Abraham by a promise.

Do you not know that if you present yourselves to anyone as obedient slaves, you are slaves of the one whom you obey, either of sin, which leads to death, or of <b>obedience, which leads to righteousness</b>?  But thanks be to God, that you who were once slaves of sin have become <b>obedient *from the heart</b> to the standard of teaching to which you were committed*, and, having been set free from sin, have become <b>slaves of righteousness</b>.  I am speaking in human terms, because of your natural limitations. For just as you once presented your members as slaves to impurity and to lawlessness leading to more lawlessness, so now present your members as slaves to righteousness leading to sanctification.  When you were slaves of sin, you were free in regard to righteousness.  But what fruit were you getting at that time from the things of which you are now ashamed? The end of those things is death.  But now that you have been <span class="underline">set free from sin and have become slaves of God, the fruit you get leads to sanctification and its end, eternal life.

Faith receives and continues to receive the supply of the Spirit. So a person needs to be having faith in Jesus to be led by the Spirit.
</p>

<p>
Sanctification is personal righteousness that is fruit that comes from being in Jesus Christ, Him being our righteousness - we're grafted into Jesus like branches on a tree and become healthier. We must and <b>should</b> stop sinning.

Luke writes that Peter says <b>the Holy Spirit</b> goes to those who obey Jesus.
If the book of Acts is finished after Paul went to Galatia, then it is in knowledge of the letter to the Galatians, where Paul says the promised Spirit is received through faith.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>

<p>
Or since Paul's journey to Galatia happened after Peter said <b>the Holy Spirit</b> is given to <span class="underline">those who obey Jesus</span>, and Paul writes that the promised Spirit is received through <span class="underline">faith</span>, even in these two passages, it's doubly confirmed that faith necessitates obedience.

The story of the prodigal son is about a person coming to repentance, and there is great joy over it.
It's not saying that following God's commandments are wrong.
It's not even saying that 'rulekeeping' is wrong.
It does say that sin leads to destruction.
It also says that God and the angels are overjoyed when people repent from sin and turn back to Him, and that God forgives and welcomes us back when we do this.

<p>
Jesus condemned sin in the flesh. Now we walk according to the spirit so that the righteous requirement of the law might be fulfilled in us.

<p>
It's still really important to put a stop to sin! And we must walk according to Jesus' commandments:

When we repent from sin we allow Jesus' holiness to shine through us increasingly.

<p>
Therefore, it's really not our own holiness or power that is responsible for miracles that happen through us or in cooperation with us, but it is Jesus' power and holiness.
</p>

<p>
Jesus is the True Vine. We are the branches. AMEN!! We can do nothing apart from Him. AMEN!!

<p>
Everyone who names the name of the Lord must depart from iniquity:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>I Corinthians 6:17-20</b> - But <span class="underline">he who is joined to the Lord becomes one spirit with him.</span> Flee from sexual immorality. Every other sin a person commits is outside the body, but the sexually immoral person sins against his own body. Or do you not know that your body is a temple of <b>the Holy Spirit</b> within you, whom you have from God? You are not your own, for you were bought with a price. So glorify God in your body.

<blockquote>
<p>

So flee youthful passions and pursue righteousness, faith, love, and peace, along with those who call on the Lord from a pure heart.
</p>

<p>
Our bodies are a vessel for Jesus' holiness to shine out of. It's the vessel of <b>the Holy Spirit</b>:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>1 Thessalonians 4:3-5</b> - For this is the will of God, your sanctification; that is, that you abstain from sexual immorality; that each of you know how to possess his own (G1438 heautou) vessel (G4632 skeuos) in sanctification and honor, not in lustful passion, like the Gentiles who do not know God; (NASB)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
We should not deceive our brothers by lying about the matter of sanctifying our bodies:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>I Thessalonians 4:6-7</b> - and that no man transgress and defraud his brother in the matter because the Lord is the avenger in all these things, just as we also told you before and solemnly warned you. For God has not called us for the purpose of impurity, but in sanctification. (NASB)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Jesus is the light in us, and we must let our light shine:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Luke 8:14-16</b> - And as for what fell among the thorns, they are those who hear, but as they go on their way they are choked by the cares and riches and pleasures of life, and their fruit does not mature. As for that in the good soil, they are those who, hearing the word, hold it fast in an honest and good heart, and bear fruit with patience. , No one after lighting a lamp covers it with a jar or puts it under a bed, but puts it on a stand, so that those who enter may see the light. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Matthew 5:15</b> - Nor do people light a lamp and put it under a basket, but on a stand, and it gives light to all in the house. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Luke 8:21</b> - But he answered them, My mother and my brothers are those who hear the word of God and do it.
</p>

<p>
The power comes from Jesus:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Luke 8:46</b> - But Jesus said, Someone touched me, for I perceive that power has gone out from me.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
When we repent and clean ourselves up, we allow Jesus' light to shine through us. The sanctification process is like cleaning a muddy window.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Luke 6:40</b> - A disciple is not above his teacher, but everyone when he is fully trained will be like his teacher.
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Luke 6:41-42</b> - Why do you see the speck that is in your brother's eye, but do not notice the log that is in your own eye? How can you say to your brother, Brother, let me take out the speck that is in your eye, when you yourself do not see the log that is in your own eye? You hypocrite, first take the log out of your own eye, and then you will see clearly to take out the speck that is in your brother's eye.

We must not indulge in sexual immorality as some of them did, and twenty-three thousand fell in a single day. We must not put Christ to the test, as some of them did and were destroyed by serpents, nor grumble, as some of them did and were destroyed by the Destroyer. Now these things happened to them as an example, but they were written down for our instruction, on whom the end of the ages has come. Therefore let anyone who thinks that he stands take heed lest he fall. No temptation has overtaken you that is not common to man. God is faithful, and he will not let you be tempted beyond your ability, but with the temptation he will also provide the way of escape, that you may be able to endure it.

This is what we must come to know in truth - that Jesus came from Father God, and that Father God sent Him - it is Father God's will:

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>John 17:8</b> - For I have given them the words that you gave me, and they have received them and have <b>come to know in truth that I came from you</b>; <span class="underline">and</span> they have believed that you sent me.

<p>
Therefore, we should receive Jesus' words and <span class="underline">obey</span> Jesus and <span class="underline">arrive</span> at the truth. Obedience is an essential part of faith. Like Abraham obeying God, or like Israel crossing through the Red Sea, it's obedience which <span class="underline">leads</span> to sure belief, and obedience that leads a person into sure knowledge of the truth, and obedience which cooperates with sanctification by the Spirit.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Exodus 14:31</b> - When Israel saw the great power which the Lord had used against the Egyptians, the people feared the Lord, and they believed (H539 <b>'aman</b>) in the Lord and in His servant Moses.

<p>
The true knowledge of Jesus grants us everything pertaining to life and godliness, allowing us to partake in the divine nature:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>II Peter 1:3-4</b> - seeing that His divine power has granted to us everything pertaining to life and godliness, <b>through the true knowledge</b> of Him who called us by His own glory and excellence.

<p>
Being set free through the knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ is at least in part being set free from the defilements of the world.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>II Peter 2:20-21</b> - For if, after they have escaped the <span class="underline">defilements of the world through the knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ</span>, they are again entangled in them and overcome, the last state has become worse for them than the first. For it would have been better for them never to have known <b>the way of righteousness</b> than after knowing it to turn back from the holy commandment delivered to them.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Then we continue to add Work/Love/Virtue to be fruitful:
</p>

<p>
But we must practice Jesus' commandments even before we have arrived at the knowledge of the truth, in order to arrive at the knowledge of the truth:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>II Peter 1:8</b> - For <b>if these qualities are yours and are increasing</b>, they render you <span class="underline">neither useless nor unfruitful</span> in the <span class="underline">true knowledge</span> (G1922 <b>epignosis</b>) of our Lord Jesus Christ.

His divine power has granted to us all things that pertain to life and godliness, through the knowledge of him who called us to his own glory and excellence, by which he has granted to us his precious and very great promises, so that through them you may become partakers of the divine nature, having escaped from the corruption that is in the world because of sinful desire.  For this very reason, make every effort to <b>supplement your faith with virtue, and virtue with knowledge, and knowledge</b> with self-control, and self-control with steadfastness, and steadfastness with godliness, and godliness with brotherly affection, and brotherly affection with love.  For if these qualities are yours and are increasing, they keep you from being ineffective or unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ.  For whoever lacks these qualities is so nearsighted that he is blind, having forgotten that he was cleansed from his former sins.  Therefore, brothers, be all the more diligent to make your calling and election sure, for if you practice these qualities you will never fall.  For in this way <span class="underline">there will be richly provided for you an entrance into the eternal kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ</span>.

Continuing to be sanctified by faith is a process where a person continues in Jesus' words because they are sanctified by faith in Jesus and that means ongoing trust and faithful obedience.

<p>
To be sanctified by faith in Jesus is an applied process, I think:
</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
In similar fashion to Jesus continually obeying Father God as he endured suffering, I think we should learn to submit and follow Jesus' commandments
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Hebrews 5:7-10</b> - In the days of his flesh, Jesus offered up prayers and supplications, with loud cries and tears, to him who was able to save him from death, and he was heard because of his reverence. <span class="underline">Although he was a son, he learned obedience through what he suffered.</span> And being made perfect, he became the source of eternal salvation to all who obey him, being designated by God a high priest after the order of Melchizedek.

<p>
I believe that after being <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220402091720/https://mullikine.github.io/posts/astral-projection/">born-again of the spirit</a>, I had (with very little knowledge of Jesus' commandments) had to learn Jesus' commandments and apply them, and I believe <b>the Holy Spirit</b> taught me to obey Jesus as I read Jesus' sayings and was subsequently tested on those sayings. For example, if I read that we must give to all who ask, and then the Lord sets up a situation where someone asks for money, then I have a choice to obey Jesus, which means resisting those who try to deter me from obeying Jesus. Upon being tested, someone would offer worldly wisdom in an attempt to deter me from following Jesus, and as I obey God I am led by <b>the Holy Spirit</b>, and taught by <b>the Holy Spirit</b>. And this is an ongoing process. I say this for others' sake to explain how I have come to know how faith in Jesus, following Jesus, works practically, that it is more than mere intellectual belief to be led by the Spirit, but it is also obedience, and a process of sanctification, and walking in the light.

<b>Acts 20:35</b> - In all things I have shown you that by working hard in this way we <b>must</b> <span class="underline">help the weak</span> and <span class="underline">remember the words of the Lord Jesus, how he himself said,</span> <b>It is more blessed to give than to receive.</b> (ESV)
</p>

<p>
As we go ahead, we <b>must</b> abide in the teaching of Christ, or we won't have God:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>II John 1:9</b> - Everyone who goes on ahead and does not abide in the teaching of Christ, does not have God. Whoever abides in the teaching has both the Father and the Son. (ESV)

<p>
Definitely stop sinning after receiving the knowledge of the truth:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Hebrews 10:26-29</b> - For if we go on sinning deliberately <b>after receiving the knowledge of the truth</b>, there no longer remains a sacrifice for sins, but a fearful expectation of judgment, and a fury of fire that will consume the adversaries. Anyone who has set aside the law of Moses dies without mercy on the evidence of two or three witnesses. How much worse punishment, do you think, will be deserved by the one who has spurned the Son of God, and has profaned the blood of the covenant by which he was sanctified, and has outraged the Spirit of grace? (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Hebrews 10:16-18</b> - This is the covenant that I will make with them after those days, declares the Lord: I will put my laws on their hearts, and write them on their minds, then he adds, I will remember their sins and their lawless deeds no more. Where there is forgiveness of these, there is no longer any offering for sin.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
To <b>know</b> if Jesus' teaching comes from God, one must desire to do God's will.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>John 7:17</b> -  If anyone's will is to do God's will, he will know whether the teaching is from God or whether I am speaking on my own authority.  (ESV)

<p>
Therefore, to arrive at the knowledge of the truth, you've got to have an obedient heart.

<h2 id="org17ea28e"><span class="section-number-2">14.</span> Justifying faith vs justifying works is misunderstood and is a false dichotomy</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-14">
<p>
Jesus makes it clear that the ones who truly believe in Him <b>will do</b> the <b>works</b> which <b>He does</b>:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>John 14:12</b> - Truly, truly, I say to you, whoever believes in me will also do the works that I do; and greater works than these will he do, because I am going to the Father. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
James believes that faith is really substantiated by works:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>James 2:22-26</b> - You see that faith was active along with his works, and faith was completed by his works; and the Scripture was fulfilled that says, Abraham believed God, and it was counted to him as righteousness—and he was called a friend of God. You see that a person is justified by works and not by faith alone. And in the same way was not also Rahab the prostitute justified by works when she received the messengers and sent them out by another way? For as the body apart from the spirit is dead, so also faith apart from works is dead. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
But works by us done in righteousness are <b>not</b> the reason God showed mercy on us to save us. God in His mercy simply gave us His Holy Spirit in abundance to wash us, to regenerate us and to renew us, and He did this so that being justified by His grace, we might become heirs according to the hope of eternal life. We were once really disobedient, but by God's grace through faith in Jesus we are now obedient. The faith was <b>becoming obedient</b> to Jesus, and out of it flows good works and obedience:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Titus 3:3-8</b> - For we ourselves were <b>once foolish, disobedient, led astray, slaves to various passions and pleasures,</b> passing our days in malice and envy, hated by others and hating one another. But when the goodness and loving kindness of God our Savior appeared, he saved us, not because of works done by us in righteousness, but according to his own mercy, by the washing of regeneration and renewal of <b>the Holy Spirit</b>, whom he poured out on us richly through <b>Jesus Christ our Savior</b>, so that being justified by his grace we might become heirs according to the hope of eternal life. The saying is trustworthy, and I want you to insist on these things, so that those who have believed in God may be careful to devote themselves to good works. These things are excellent and profitable for people. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
So Jesus saves us to become set free from various passions and pleasures and to become far more obedient to righteousness, and this is done through faith in Jesus Christ. Believing in Jesus Christ is the entry point for the salvation that is through Him.
</p>

<p>
So the point I'm trying to make is that the free gift of <b>the Holy Spirit</b> is received by faith alone, just be trusting in Jesus Christ to be saved, but Jesus Christ helps us to become slaves of righteousness which leads to eternal life.
</p>

<p>
Therefore I still think there's a false dichotomy between faith and works - because obedience is intrinsic to faith, but the gift of <b>the Holy Spirit</b> remains a completely free gift which is <span class="underline">received through faith</span> and that <b>merit</b> by works of righteousness is not the reason <b>why</b> it's given to us, but nevertheless, <span class="underline"><b>the Holy Spirit</b> is given to those who obey Him.</span>
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Acts 5:32</b> - And we are witnesses to these things, and so is <b>he Holy Spirit</b>, whom God has given <span class="underline">to those who obey him</span>. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Galatians 3:14</b> - so that in Christ Jesus the blessing of Abraham might come to the Gentiles, so that we might <b>receive the promised Spirit through faith</b>. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Some people think that this obedience means it's no longer a free gift, where I do not agree with those people. I think that the obedience to Jesus is receiving the free gift through faith.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>John 6:28-29</b> - Then they said to him, <span class="underline">What must we do, to be doing the works of God?</span> Jesus answered them, This is the work of God, that <b>you believe (G4100 pisteuo) in him whom he has sent.</b> (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
True faith is always obedient; faith is always prepared to obey more:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>John 7:17</b>- If anyone's will is to do God's will, he will know whether the teaching is from God or whether I am speaking on my own authority.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
You can't even have faith in God without obeying Jesus because the one who has faith in God has already obeyed Jesus whether they know about <code>Mark 11:22 or not</code>. So it's not a dead work.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Philippians 2:12</b> - Therefore, my beloved, as you have <b>always obeyed</b>, so now, not only as in my presence but much more in my absence, work out (katergazomai) your own salvation with fear and trembling, (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
And justifying faith is having obedient faith in God with regards to the promise given to Abraham.
</p>

<p>
Obeying God <b>is</b> having faith in God. Obeying God <b>is</b> loving God. AMEN!!
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Mark 11:22</b> - And Jesus answered them, Have (G2192 echo) faith (G4102 <b>pistis</b>) in God (G2316 theos). (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
<b>pistis</b> is the faith noun.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>John 14:1</b> - “Do not let your heart be troubled; believe (G4100 <b>pisteuo</b>) in God, believe (G4100 <b>pisteuo</b>) also in Me. (NASB)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
<b>pisteuo</b> is the faith verb.
</p>

<p>
<b>echo</b> means 'to hold' - so in <b>Mark 11:22</b> Jesus says 'hold faith' in God.
And in <b>John 14:1</b> Jesus tells us to 'do faith' in God and to 'do faith' in Him.
</p>

<p>
If you are believing in Jesus, then you are obediently working.
</p>

<p>
To be justified, a person must <span class="underline">walk in the footsteps of the faith that our father Abraham had before he was circumcised</span>.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Romans 4:9-12</b> - Is this blessing then only for the circumcised, or also for the uncircumcised? We say that faith was counted to Abraham as righteousness. How then was it counted to him? Was it before or after he had been circumcised? It was not after, but before he was circumcised. He received the sign of circumcision as a seal of the righteousness that he had by faith while he was still uncircumcised. The purpose was to make him the father of all who believe without being circumcised, so that righteousness would be counted to them as well, and to make him the father of the circumcised who are <span class="underline">not merely circumcised but who also walk in the footsteps of the faith that our father Abraham had before he was circumcised</span>.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Having faith in God <b>is</b> obeying God. Loving God <b>is</b> obeying God. AMEN!!
</p>

<p>
So what Jesus is saying is quite similar - we must have the faith that Abraham had when he put Isaac on the Altar, but in regards to following Jesus:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Luke 9:23-24</b> - And he said to all, If anyone would come after me, let him deny himself and take up his cross daily and follow me. For whoever would save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for my sake will save it. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
<b>Romans 4:4</b> - Now to the one who works, his wages are not counted as a gift but as his due.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
I believe that what <i>Romans 4:4</i> is saying is that before accepting God's forgiveness yourself, submitting to the righteousness of God, believing that you were in need of God's forgiveness,
anything you try to give God is simply giving God what is due to Him, and that you will never be able to return enough stolen goods to God to ever be justified. Nor would you ever be able to forgive enough other people to attain that justification.
<span class="underline">You ultimately need God's forgiveness</span>. However, forgiving others is still required if someone wants God to forgive them.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Mark 11:25</b> - And whenever you stand praying, forgive, if you have anything against anyone, so that your Father also who is in heaven may forgive you your trespasses.
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Matthew 6:12-15</b> -  and forgive us our debts, as we also have forgiven our debtors.  And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil.  For if you forgive others their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you, but if you do not forgive others their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses.  (ESV)

<h3 id="org497bc7a"><span class="section-number-3">14.1.</span> Obedient action including seeking God in faith (trusting God's words and seeking)</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-14-1">
<p>
I believe that obedient action which includes seeking God is an important part of faith.
</p>

<p>
I believe obedience is intrinsic to faith, actually.
</p>

<p>
True faith is always obedient; faith is always prepared to obey more:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>John 7:17</b>- If anyone's will is to do God's will, he will know whether the teaching is from God or whether I am speaking on my own authority.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Obedient action is not dead works, and I believe that obedient action is just working faith.
</p>

<p>
Being disobedient to Jesus means disbelieving in Jesus:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>John 3:36</b> - Whoever believes (G4100 pisteuo) in the Son has eternal life; whoever does not obey the Son shall not see life, but the wrath of God remains on him. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Romans 4:2</b> - For if Abraham was justified by works, he has something to boast about, but not before God.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Paul doesn't deny that Abraham could have been
justified by works, but he claims that Abraham
doesn't have anything to boast about before
God. AMEN!!
</p>

<p>
Because he offered nothing to God through his work other than what was asked of him.
</p>

<p>
Jesus was perfectly faithful to God by being obedient:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Philippians 2:8</b> - And being found in human form, he humbled himself by becoming obedient to the point of death, even death on a cross. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Romans 9:15-16</b> - For he says to Moses, I will have mercy on whom I have mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I have compassion. So then it depends not on human will or exertion, but on God, who has mercy. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
AMEN!! But that doesn't mean human will or exertion cannot be utilised by God.
</p>

<p>
God rewards faith and may choose to reveal Himself after a while serving God in faith instead of immediately.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Matthew 25:19</b> - Now after a long time the master of those servants came and settled accounts with them.
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Acts 20:35</b> - In all things I have shown you that by working hard in this way we must help the weak and remember the words of the Lord Jesus, how he himself said, It is more <b>blessed to give</b> than to receive.
</p>
</blockquote>

<div id="outline-container-orgb73a478" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orgb73a478"><span class="section-number-3">14.2.</span> Obedience belongs in faith</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-14-2">
<p>
In God's mercy He has shown us the Way to be reconciled with Him. He has given us Jesus. He has told us what to do, and we can choose to be obedient or to not be obedient.
</p>

<p>
Jesus is the author of our faith, so having faith is grace from God, and even if works are working with our faith, it's all by grace and we still can't boast before God because our faith and our works are all gifted to us from God.
</p>

<p>
For example, Noah's works of building the ark was given to Him by God. God even outlined every detail.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Hebrews 12:1-2</b> - Therefore, since we are surrounded by so great a cloud of witnesses, let us also lay aside every weight, and sin which clings so closely, and let us run with endurance the race that is set before us, looking to Jesus, the <b>founder</b> and <b>perfecter</b> of our faith, who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross, despising the shame, and is seated at the right hand of the throne of God.
</p>
</blockquote>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Obedience belongs inside faith because
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>God commanded it and complying is not really bringing anything
to God which He hasn't told you to bring to Him.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>So it's just acting in faith</li>
<li>If God commands you to build an ark, and you build it exactly as specified, is that considered dead works? No, it's just doing exactly what God said. It's faith.</li>
<li>If God commands you to wait 5 days before going into battle but you think 8 days would be better, thinking God needs the extra time so you can be more prepared so you wait 8 days then that is no longer faith because it's disobedience.</li>
<li>Abraham was commanded to offer Isaac as a sacrifice, and Abraham did offer Isaac out of faithful obedience.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><b>Genesis 22:2</b> - He said, Take your son, your only son Isaac, whom you love, and go to the land of Moriah, and offer him there as a burnt offering on one of the mountains of which I shall tell you.</li>
<li><b>James 2:22</b> - You see that faith was active along with his works, and faith was completed by his works;</li>
</ul></li>
<li>But if Abraham thought he could get even more rewards from God by trying the same thing again and putting Isaac on the altar again without God even commanding it, then that is like trying to justify yourself by doing dead works (i.e. deeds without faith).</li>
</ul></li>

<li>Choosing to obey God's commandments even when no-one is watching (aside from God) is having faith in God.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>For example, not stealing from your employer.</li>
<li>Therefore, there is a way of abiding by God's commandments which is faith and not works.</li>
<li>To not steal is to love God and have faith in God.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Seeking God in action belongs in faith because:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>When someone wills to do God's will, they come to know the truth
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><b>John 7:17</b> - If anyone's will is to do God's will, he will know whether the teaching is from God or whether I am speaking on my own authority. (ESV)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>When someone has faith, they believe that God exists and that in seeking God, God rewards them:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><b>Hebrews 11:6</b> - And without faith it is impossible to please him, for whoever would draw near to God must believe that he exists and that he rewards those who seek him.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>
Salvation is the gift, and faith implies an obedient heart. Works can be dead works when they're not done in faith. Faith is what justifies. But faith works. Faith requires obedience to God. Faithless works do not justify:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Ephesians 2:8-9</b> - For <b>by grace you have been saved through faith.</b> And this is not your own doing; it is the gift of God, not a result of works, so that no one may boast. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
With an obedient heart, a person will receive revelation as they hear the teaching of Jesus.
</p>

<p>
A person must be at least willing to do His will - obedience is the essence of faith:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>John 7:17</b> - If anyone is willing to do His will, he will know of the teaching, whether it is of God or whether I speak from Myself.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Therefore, faith quickly progresses into good work, serving the living God.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Hebrews 9:14</b> - how much more will the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself without blemish to God, purify our conscience from dead works to serve the living God.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
'Believing in rewards from God for seeking Him' belongs in faith, or it's not faith anymore, even in regards to justifying faith.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Hebrews 11:6</b> - And without faith it is impossible to please him, for whoever would draw near to God must believe that he exists and that he rewards those who seek him.
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Hebrews 11:24-26</b> - By faith Moses, when he was grown up, refused to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter, choosing rather to be mistreated with the people of God than to enjoy the fleeting pleasures of sin. <b>He considered the reproach of Christ greater wealth than the treasures of Egypt, for he was looking to the reward</b>.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
We should pursue Jesus Christ similarly. God commanded it.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Mark 9:7</b> - And a cloud overshadowed them, and a voice came out of the cloud, This is my beloved Son; listen to him.
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Luke 9:35</b> - And a voice came out of the cloud, saying, This is my Son, my Chosen One; listen to him!
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>1 Timothy 1:15-17</b> - The saying is trustworthy and deserving of full acceptance, that <b>Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners</b>, of whom I am the foremost. But I received mercy for this reason, that in me, as the foremost, Jesus Christ might display his perfect patience <b>as an example</b> to those who were to believe (G4100 <b>pisteuo</b>) in him for eternal life. To the King of ages, immortal, invisible, the only God, be honor and glory forever and ever. Amen. (ESV)

<p>
Obedience is good.
</p>

<p>
'Working' for God is OK when it's done in faith.
Obedience is intrinsic to faith.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Hebrews 11:31</b> - By faith Rahab the prostitute did not perish with those who were disobedient, because she had given a friendly welcome to the spies.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
And after a time, the LORD visits and judges on deeds, and on words:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Revelation of John 3:2-3</b> - Wake up, and strengthen what remains and is about to die, for I have not found your works complete in the sight of my God. So remember what you have received and heard; and keep it, and repent. Therefore if you do not wake up, I will come like a thief, and you will not know at what hour I will come to you.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Jesus judges on deeds and on words (possibly on the way you judge others, the same standard is measured back to you; also important is confessing Jesus Christ before others):
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Matthew 12:35-37</b> - The good person out of his good treasure brings forth good, and the evil person out of his evil treasure brings forth evil. I tell you, on the day of judgment people will give account for every careless word they speak, for <span class="underline">by your words you will be justified, and by your words you will be condemned</span>.

<p>
The LORD God judges impartially according to each one's deeds:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>I Peter 1:17</b> - And if you call on him as Father who <span class="underline">judges impartially according to each one's deeds</span>, conduct yourselves with fear throughout the time of your exile,

We must follow the way righteousness, repenting from sin, and following Jesus Christ. Jesus Christ is Lord:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>II Peter 2:1-3</b> - But false prophets also arose among the people, just as there will be false teachers among you, who will secretly bring in destructive heresies, even denying the Master who bought them, bringing upon themselves swift destruction. And many will follow their sensuality, and because of them the way of truth will be blasphemed. And in their greed they will exploit you with false words. Their condemnation from long ago is not idle, and their destruction is not asleep.
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>II Peter 2:20-22</b> - For if, after they have escaped the defilements of the world through the knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, they are again entangled in them and overcome, the last state has become worse for them than the first. For it would have been better for them never to have known the way of righteousness than after knowing it to turn back from the holy commandment delivered to them. What the true proverb says has happened to them: The dog returns to its own vomit, and the sow, after washing herself, returns to wallow in the mire.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-14-4">
<p>
What is wrong is trying to establish a righteousness of one's own apart from submitting to the righteousness of God - it's saying, "God, I think you should have this, or, God I think I'm righteous because I did this for you." rather than, "here is what you asked of me, LORD."
</p>

<p>
Work not done in faith:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Leviticus 10:1-2</b> - Now Nadab and Abihu, the sons of Aaron, each took his censer and put fire in it and laid incense on it and offered unauthorized fire before the Lord, which he had not commanded them. And fire came out from before the Lord and consumed them, and they died before the Lord.
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>I Samuel 15:22-23</b> - And Samuel said, Has the LORD as great delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices, as in obeying the voice of the LORD? Behold, to <span class="underline">obey is better than sacrifice</span>, and <span class="underline">to listen than the fat of rams</span>.

</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
God didn't ask for the offering which Nadab and Abihu offered.
</p>

<p>
Ananias gave to God unfaithfully, in a manner similar to Cain.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Acts 4:32</b> - Now the full number of those who believed were of one heart and soul, and no one said that any of the things that belonged to him was his own, but they had everything in common.
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Acts 5:1-5</b> -  But a man named Ananias, with his wife Sapphira, sold a piece of property, and with his wife's knowledge he kept back for himself some of the proceeds and brought only a part of it and laid it at the apostles' feet.  But Peter said, Ananias, why has Satan filled your heart to lie to <b>the Holy Spirit</b> and to keep back for yourself part of the proceeds of the land?  While it remained unsold, did it not remain your own?  And after it was sold, was it not at your disposal?  Why is it that you have contrived this deed in your heart?  You have not lied to men but to God.  When Ananias heard these words, he fell down and breathed his last.  And great fear came upon all who heard of it.  (ESV)

<p>
Cain was half-hearted with his offering to the LORD, as Ananias was:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Genesis 4:3-5</b> - In the course of time Cain brought to the Lord an offering of the fruit of the ground, and Abel also brought of the firstborn of his flock and of their fat portions.

Or have you not read in the Law how on the Sabbath the priests in the temple profane the Sabbath and are guiltless? I tell you, something greater than the temple is here.

<p>
Works and faith can't exist apart from one another because even to believe in Jesus is a work, and if the belief is true then the obedience continues.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>John 6:28-29</b> - Then they said to him, <span class="underline">What must we do, to be doing the works of God?</span> Jesus answered them, This is the work of God, that <b>you believe (G4100 pisteuo) in him whom he has sent.</b>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
To be justified, a person must <span class="underline">walk in the footsteps of the faith that our father Abraham had before he was circumcised</span>.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Romans 4:9-12</b> - Is this blessing then only for the circumcised, or also for the uncircumcised? We say that faith was counted to Abraham as righteousness. How then was it counted to him? Was it before or after he had been circumcised? It was not after, but before he was circumcised. He received the sign of circumcision as a seal of the righteousness that he had by faith while he was still uncircumcised. The purpose was to make him the father of all who believe without being circumcised, so that righteousness would be counted to them as well, and to make him the father of the circumcised who are <span class="underline">not merely circumcised but who also walk in the footsteps of the faith that our father Abraham had before he was circumcised</span>.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
So what Jesus is saying is quite similar - we must have the faith that Abraham had when he put Isaac on the Altar, but in regards to following Jesus:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Luke 9:23-24</b> - And he said to all, If anyone would come after me, let him deny himself and take up his cross daily and follow me. For whoever would save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for my sake will save it. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Even the demons believe God is one and they shudder. The faithful believe God and love God (a totally different response). Love is obedience to God, and includes accepting and having faith in the one who God sent, Jesus.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>James 2:19</b> - You believe that God is one; you do well. Even the demons believe—and shudder!
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>John 8:42</b> - Jesus said to them, If God were your Father, you would love me, for I came from God and I am here. I came not of my own accord, but he sent me.

</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>I John 5:2-3</b> - By this we know that we love the children of God, when we love God and obey his commandments. For this is the love of God, that we keep his commandments. And his commandments are not burdensome.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Faith doesn't exist without obedience. Obedience doesn't exist without faith. The obedient will love Jesus, obeying Jesus, having faith in Jesus.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>James 2:18</b> - But someone will say, You have faith and I have works. Show me your faith apart from your works, and I will show you my faith by my works.
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Romans 1:5</b> - through whom we have received grace and apostleship to bring about the <b>obedience of faith</b> for the sake of his name among all the nations, (ESV)

<p>
God's commandment is to bring about the obedience of faith (having faith is in God and through Jesus Christ is being obedient to God):
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Romans 16:26</b> - but has now been disclosed and through the prophetic writings has been made known to all nations, according to the command of the eternal God, to bring about the <b>obedience of faith</b> — (ESV)

<p>
We go from performing 'dead works' to 'faithful works'.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Hebrews 9:14</b> - how much more will the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself without blemish to God, purify our conscience from dead works to serve the living God.

</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Matthew 25:21</b> - His master said to him, Well done, good and faithful servant. You have been faithful over a little; I will set you over much. Enter into the joy of your master.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
We stop doing dead works to serve the living God, which I believe is obedience,
which is really similar to work but it's obeying. Obedience gives glory to God.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>John 13:34-35</b> - A new commandment I give to you, that you love one another: just as I have loved you, you also are to love one another. By this all people will know that you are my disciples, if you have love for one another. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Obeying Jesus' commandments are not 'dead works'.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Exodus 20:12-17</b> - Honor your father and your mother, that your days may be long in the land that the Lord your God is giving you. You shall not murder. You shall not commit adultery. You shall not steal. You shall not bear false witness against your neighbor. You shall not covet your neighbor's house; you shall not covet your neighbor's wife, or his male servant, or his female servant, or his ox, or his donkey, or anything that is your neighbor's.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Jesus said:
</p>

<blockquote>

Obeying God by following the 10 commandments properly, in truth, is not performing 'dead works'.
</p>

<p>
The Holy Spirit cleanses our hearts by faith:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Acts 15:8-9</b> - And God, who knows the heart, bore witness to them, by giving them <b>the Holy Spirit</b> just as he did to us, and he made no distinction between us and them, having cleansed their hearts by faith.
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Hebrews 9:14</b> - how much more will the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself without blemish to God, purify our conscience from dead works to serve the living God.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Service to God is obeying God through Christ's commandments. It's being a bond-servant of Christ.
</p>

<p>
Also, the following means that having faith in Jesus is tightly coupled to doing the works that Jesus did - to acting like Jesus - to obeying His commandments.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>John 14:12</b> - Truly, truly, I say to you, whoever believes in me will also do the works that I do; and <b>greater works than these will he do</b>, because I am going to the Father.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Whoever has faith in Jesus, the works that Jesus does, that person will do.
Pisteuo (pisteuōn) = faith.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>John 14:12</b> - Truly (G281 amen), truly (G281 amen), I say (G3004 lego) to you, he who believes (G4100 pisteuo) in Me, the works (G2041 ergon) that I do (G4160 poieo), he will do (G4160 poieo) also (G2548 kakeinos); and greater (G3173 megas) works than these (G3778 houtos) he will do (G4160 poieo); because (G3754 hoti) I go (G4198 poreuomai) to the Father (G3962 pater).

You can't have only half of Jesus. Jesus both protects us and disciplines us:

<p>
I believe a heart must be both believing <b>and</b> obedient to receive the grace through faith, since I believe true faith is both obedient and believing.
</p>

<p>
After receiving justification (counted not guilty) through obedient and believing faith, we should continue in obedient and believing faith but the work we do is to be tested and is not essential to our justification:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>1 Corinthians 3:15</b> - If anyone's work is burned up, he will suffer loss, though he himself will be saved, but only as through fire. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
We love (obey) because He loved us first, and through obedience we are sanctified, which leads to eternal life.
</p>

<p>
Heresies:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><span class="underline">free grace without Lordship</span> (without sanctification by the Spirit)
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>the person in this category abides in Jesus extremely precariously, and only if they are actively trusting in Jesus.</li>
<li>Trusting and obeying Jesus qualifies, but belief without obedience or trust in the heart doesn't qualify.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><span class="underline">Lordship without free grace</span> (working to be forgiven, without belief in the truth)
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Well, I mean, they are actually trusting in Jesus if they are following Jesus and doing what He said.</li>
<li>But if they are just doing good works to get to heaven then I think that's not really right.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>
I believe that either of these heresies fall under this strong delusion category:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>2 Thessalonians 2:11-13</b> - Therefore God sends them a strong delusion, so that they may believe what is false, in order that all may be condemned who did not believe the truth but had pleasure in unrighteousness.  But we ought always to give thanks to God for you, brothers beloved by the Lord, because God chose you as the firstfruits to be saved, through <b>sanctification by the Spirit and belief in the truth.</b>  (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>I Timothy 6:3-11</b> - If anyone teaches a different doctrine and does not agree with <span class="underline">the sound words of our Lord Jesus Christ and the teaching that accords with godliness</span>, he is <span class="underline">puffed up with conceit and understands nothing.</span> He has an unhealthy craving for controversy and for quarrels about words, which produce envy, dissension, slander, evil suspicions, and constant friction among people who are depraved in mind and deprived of the truth, imagining that godliness is a means of gain. Now there is great gain in <span class="underline">godliness with contentment,</span> for we brought nothing into the world, and we cannot take anything out of the world. But if we have food and clothing, with these we will be content. But <span class="underline">those who desire to be rich fall into temptation, into a snare, into many senseless and harmful desires that plunge people into ruin and destruction.</span> For the love of money is a root of all kinds of evils. It is through this craving that some have wandered away from the faith and pierced themselves with many pangs. But as for you, O man of God, <span class="underline">flee these things</span>. Pursue righteousness, godliness, faith, love, steadfastness, gentleness. (ESV)

<p>
Correct Christology is important, but so is obeying Jesus' commandments, and obeying Jesus' commandments is possibly even more important than belief:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Matthew 21:28-31</b> - “But what do you think? A man had two sons, and he came to the first and said, ‘Son, go work today in the vineyard.’ And he answered, ‘I will not’; but afterward he regretted it and went.  The man came to the second and said the same thing; and he answered, ‘I will, sir’; but he did not go.  <b>Which of the two did the will of his father?” They said, “The first.”</b> Jesus said to them, “Truly I say to you that <b>the tax collectors and prostitutes will get into the kingdom of God before you.</b>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
We must keep ourselves in the love of God by obeying Jesus Christ's commandments, because we're awaiting to receive eternal life:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Jude 1:21</b> - <b>keep yourselves in the love of God,</b> waiting for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ that leads to eternal life. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Keeping Jesus Christ's commandments is a requirement to inherit eternal life:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>John 15:10</b> - <b>If you keep my commandments, you will abide in my love,</b> just as I have kept my Father's commandments and abide in his love. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Whoever truly believes Jesus trusts in and is obedient to Jesus. We must obey Jesus Christ, and that obedience means being a slave of righteousness, leading to sanctification, which leads to eternal life:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>John 3:36</b> - Whoever believes in the Son has eternal life; whoever does not obey the Son shall not see life, but the wrath of God remains on him. (ESV)

Seek God:

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Hebrews 11:6</b> - And without faith it is impossible to please him, for whoever would draw near to God must believe that he exists and that he rewards those who seek him. (ESV)
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Jeremiah 29:11</b> - For I know the plans I have for you, declares the LORD, plans for wholeness and not for evil, to give you a future and a hope. (ESV)

</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Desire to do the will of God, and allow God's word to teach you what that is:

Actually practice faith, and don't over-intellectualise God:

Fear of God or love for Him in obedience or thankfulness is work which comes out of belief.
But faith works, even saving faith works. Saving faith <b>especially</b> requires obedience, I think.
Faith without work doesn't exist I think because the work of God is to believe on who He has sent - Jesus.

The account of Jesus itself when it's read, and Jesus' words, are enough to inspire faith. Therefore, faith comes by hearing the word of Christ.
</p>

<p>
Jesus calls persistent endurance a work. It's also required to keep our confidence:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Hebrews 10:35-36</b>- Therefore do not throw away your confidence, which has a great reward. For <span class="underline">you have need of endurance, so that when you have done the will of God you may receive what is promised.</span>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Faith is like Peter stepping out on the water. Faith works. But I think sometimes to create faith someone just has to actually believe Jesus because Jesus performs the miracle / the work.
</p>

<p>
The LORD did something similar for the Israelites when He parted the Red Sea.
The Israelites obeyed God, and their obedience led them to sure belief.
Obedience, belief and trust are all important in faith.

<p>
Revelation comes as we do what God commands us:

<b>John 7:17</b> - If anyone's will is to do God's will, he will know whether the teaching is from God or whether I am speaking on my own authority. (ESV)
</p>

And I feel like we just need to start obeying God and obeying Jesus in order to be saved. Obedience is steps of faith.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Exodus 14:14-16</b> - The Lord will fight for you, and you have only to be silent.  The Lord said to Moses, Why do you cry to me? Tell the people of Israel to go forward.

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Exodus 14:21-30</b> - Then Moses stretched out his hand over the sea, and the Lord drove the sea back by a strong east wind all night and made the sea dry land, and the waters were divided. And the people of Israel went into the midst of the sea on dry ground, the waters being a wall to them on their right hand and on their left. The Egyptians pursued and went in after them into the midst of the sea, all Pharaoh's horses, his chariots, and his horsemen. And in the morning watch the Lord in the pillar of fire and of cloud looked down on the Egyptian forces and threw the Egyptian forces into a panic, clogging their chariot wheels so that they drove heavily. And the Egyptians said, Let us flee from before Israel, for the Lord fights for them against the Egyptians. Then the Lord said to Moses, Stretch out your hand over the sea, that the water may come back upon the Egyptians, upon their chariots, and upon their horsemen. So Moses stretched out his hand over the sea, and the sea returned to its normal course when the morning appeared. And as the Egyptians fled into it, the Lord threw the Egyptians into the midst of the sea. The waters returned and covered the chariots and the horsemen; of all the host of Pharaoh that had followed them into the sea, not one of them remained. But the people of Israel walked on dry ground through the sea, the waters being a wall to them on their right hand and on their left. Thus the Lord saved Israel that day from the hand of the Egyptians, and Israel saw the Egyptians dead on the seashore.

Salvation is the gift, and faith implies an obedient heart. Works can be dead works when they're not done in faith. Faith is what justifies. But faith works. Faith requires obedience to God. Faithless works do not justify:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>

<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-14-5-7-1">
<p>
A person must be at least willing to do His will - obedience is the essence of faith:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>John 7:17</b> - If anyone is willing to do His will, he will know of the teaching, whether it is of God or whether I speak from Myself.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
I think <b>Ephesians 2:8-9</b> when it says 'through faith' doesn't actually exclude obedience (obeying Jesus), because I think obedience is intrinsic to faith.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Exodus 14:14-16</b> - The Lord will fight for you, and you have only to be silent.  The Lord said to Moses, Why do you cry to me? Tell the people of Israel to go forward.

</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
When it says "not a result of works", I believe that something more like, even if works were tied into the faith, it's by grace. If a person's saving faith included works then that is fine.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>I Corinthians 4:7</b> - For who sees anything different in you? What do you have that you did not receive? If then you received it, why do you boast as if you did not receive it? (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Our works have been gifted to us by God's grace - works of deed and word:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Ephesians 2:10</b> - For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God prepared beforehand, that we should walk in them. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
God chose us and called us out of darkness into His marvelous light to proclaim His excellencies:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>I Peter 2:9</b> - But you are a chosen race, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people for his own possession, that you may <span class="underline">proclaim the excellencies of him who called you out of darkness into his marvelous light.</span> (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Faith-in-God is hearing God's word and believing it, and even acting on it, or at least the readiness to act on it.
A person may act on faith in their heart by arriving at conviction. But it has to be faith in the truth.
Then, like Peter stepping out on the water, or like the woman at the well going in to town to tell people about Jesus, or turning from sinful things, it produces more obedience.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Matthew 14:27-32</b> - But immediately Jesus spoke to them, saying, Take heart; it is I. Do not be afraid. And Peter answered him, Lord, if it is you, <b>command</b> me to come to you on the water. He said, Come. So Peter <b>got out of the boat and walked on the water and came to Jesus</b>. But when he saw the wind, he was afraid, and beginning to sink he cried out, Lord, save me. Jesus immediately reached out his hand and took hold of him, saying to him, O you of little faith, why did you doubt? And when they got into the boat, the wind ceased.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
And there is an amount of faith, and true belief is all that's required to be saved, but Faith is so tightly linked to Obedience like Faith is linked to Hope. True belief is enough because it accepts what Jesus says, as a child believes. But I don't think this discounts that the same faith continues and increases through obedience.
</p>

<p>
Some people never seem to arrive:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>II Timothy 3:6-9</b> - For among them are those who creep into households and capture weak women, burdened with sins and led astray by various passions, always learning and <span class="underline">never able to arrive at a knowledge of the truth</span>. Just as Jannes and Jambres opposed Moses, so these <span class="underline">men also oppose the truth, men corrupted in mind and disqualified regarding the faith</span>. But they will not get very far, for their folly will be plain to all, as was that of those two men.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
But the ones who do arrive actually <span class="underline">follow the teaching</span>:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>II Timothy 3:10-13</b> - You, however, have <span class="underline">followed my teaching, my conduct, my aim in life, my faith, my patience, my love, my steadfastness, my persecutions and sufferings that happened to me</span> at Antioch, at Iconium, and at Lystra—which persecutions I endured; yet from them all the Lord rescued me. Indeed, <span class="underline">all who desire to live a godly life in Christ Jesus will be persecuted,</span> while evil people and impostors will go on from bad to worse, deceiving and being deceived.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Peter demonstrated obedience. A changed heart is essential to be saved, I think, because it must produce more obedience.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>II Corinthians 10:5-6</b> - We destroy arguments and every lofty opinion raised against the knowledge of God, and take every thought captive to obey Christ, being ready to punish every disobedience, when your obedience is complete.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Hebrews describes faith as the hope and conviction we need to draw near to God because we need to believe that He exists and that He rewards those who seek him.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Hebrews 11:1</b> - Now faith is the assurance of things hoped for, the conviction of things not seen.
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Hebrews 11:6</b> - And without faith it is impossible to please him, for whoever would draw near to God must believe that he exists and that he rewards those who seek him.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The whole chapter of Hebrews 11 also describes many 'acts' of faith.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>I Corinthians 13:13</b> - So now faith, hope, and love abide, these three; but the greatest of these is love.
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>1 Timothy 1:5</b> -  The aim of our charge is love that issues from a pure heart and a good conscience and a sincere faith.  (ESV)

Something like this:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>I Thessalonians 1:3</b> - remembering before our God and Father your work of faith and labor of love and steadfastness of hope in our Lord Jesus Christ. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
As the LORD's works are done in faithfulness, our work should be done in faithfulness towards God.
Everything we do should be done in faithfulness to Him.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Psalms 33:4</b> - For the word of the LORD is upright, and all his work is done in faithfulness. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Even after arriving at the true knowledge through obedience, faith is further supplemented/nourished/aided by virtue, knowledge, self-control, steadfastness, godliness, brotherly affection and love:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>II Peter 1:3-7</b> - His divine power has granted to us all things that pertain to life and godliness, through the knowledge of him who called us to his own glory and excellence, by which he has granted to us his precious and very great promises, so that through them you may become partakers of the divine nature, having escaped from the corruption that is in the world because of sinful desire. For this very reason, make every effort to <span class="underline">supplement your faith with virtue</span>, and virtue with knowledge, and knowledge with self-control, and self-control with steadfastness, and steadfastness with godliness, and godliness with brotherly affection, and brotherly affection with love. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The true knowledge of Jesus grants us everything pertaining to life and godliness, allowing us to partake in the divine nature. We should then reinforce the divine nature with such things:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>II Peter 1:3-4</b> - seeing that His divine power has granted to us everything pertaining to life and godliness, <b>through the true knowledge</b> of Him who called us by His own glory and excellence. For by these He has granted to us His precious and magnificent promises, so that <b>by them you may become partakers of the divine nature, having escaped the corruption that is in the world by lust.</b> (NASB)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Because, having <b>arrived</b> at the true knowledge of Jesus, we are partakers of the divine nature, in order to be fruitful we should supply to our faith those qualities:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>II Peter 1:8</b> - For <b>if these qualities are yours and are increasing</b>, they render you <span class="underline">neither useless nor unfruitful</span> in the <span class="underline">true knowledge</span> (G1922 <b>epignosis</b>) of our Lord Jesus Christ.

<p>
<b>Romans 4:5-8</b> - And to the one who does not work but trusts him who justifies the ungodly, his faith is counted as righteousness, just as David also speaks of the blessing of the one to whom God counts righteousness apart from works: Blessed are those whose lawless deeds are forgiven, and whose sins are covered; blessed is the man against whom the Lord will not count his sin.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
AMEN!! But this doesn't mean the other elements of working faith can't play a part.
</p>

<p>
Without love, faith is dead:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>I Corinthians 13:1</b> - If I speak in the tongues of men and of angels, but have not love, I am a noisy gong or a clanging cymbal.
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>John 6:28-29</b> - Then they said to him, <span class="underline">What must we do, to be doing the works of God?</span> Jesus answered them, This is the work of God, that <b>you believe (G4100 pisteuo) in him whom he has sent.</b> (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
<code>pisteuo</code> is obedient faith as it is the verb for faith (pistis).
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>James 2:22-26</b> - You see that faith was active along with his works, and faith was completed by his works; and the Scripture was fulfilled that says, Abraham believed God, and it was counted to him as righteousness-and he was called a friend of God. You see that a person is justified by works and not by faith alone. And in the same way was not also Rahab the prostitute justified by works when she received the messengers and sent them out by another way? For as the body apart from the spirit is dead, so also faith apart from works is dead. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Without faith, work is dead. Whatever actions we make outside of faith is sin:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Romans 14:23</b> - But whoever has doubts is condemned if he eats, because the eating is not from faith. For whatever does not proceed from faith is sin.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
But the work of God is to believe in whom He has sent. So even believing in Jesus is work that is done in faith:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>John 6:28-29</b> - Then they said to him, <span class="underline">What must we do, to be doing the works of God?</span> Jesus answered them, This is the work of God, that <b>you believe (G4100 pisteuo) in him whom he has sent.</b> (ESV)

Faith has 'substance/magnitude' and may be described as a vector:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The origin of hope/belief is represented by the point.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>On the Faith plane, positive magnitude comes from trust in God</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Hope-from/in-God is the direction.</li>
<li>Work/Love/Obedience is the magnitude.</li>
</ul>

<p>
I want to be clear, having faith in Jesus Christ is not dead faith.
Dead faith is precisely not having faith in Jesus Christ.
</p>

<p>
An obedient heart is required for it to not be 'dead faith'.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>John 7:17</b> - If anyone's will is to do God's will, he will know whether the teaching is from God or whether I am speaking on my own authority.

<p>
Faith in the wrong thing:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>On the Faithless plane, positive magnitude comes from trust in something else, i.e. money or self</li>
</ul>

<p>
But it's God that tests the faith, and God that justifies. That's why I don't like making an assertion on the exact way that God justifies, because God is the justifier.

<b>Galatians 5:5</b> - For through the Spirit, by faith, we ourselves eagerly <b>wait for the hope of righteousness</b>.

<b>Galatians 5:18</b> - But <b>if</b> you are led by the Spirit, you are not under the law.

<p>
We must be <b>doing</b> the will of God to not be under the law:

Righteousness is the free gift to be received through obedience:

<p>
Jesus made the Way - He <b>is</b> the Way:

<p>
<b>Romans 6:13-23</b> - Do not present your members to sin as instruments for unrighteousness, but present yourselves to God as those who have been brought from death to life, and your members to God as instruments for righteousness.  For sin will have no dominion over you, since you are not under law but under grace.  What then? Are we to sin because we are not under law but under grace? By no means!  Do you not know that if you present yourselves to anyone as obedient slaves, you are slaves of the one whom you obey, either of sin, which leads to death, or of <b>obedience, which leads to righteousness</b>?  But thanks be to God, that you who were once slaves of sin have become <b>obedient *from the heart</b> to the standard of teaching to which you were committed*, and, having been set free from sin, have become <b>slaves of righteousness</b>.  I am speaking in human terms, because of your natural limitations. For just as you once presented your members as slaves to impurity and to lawlessness leading to more lawlessness, so now present your members as slaves to righteousness leading to sanctification.  When you were slaves of sin, you were free in regard to righteousness.  But what fruit were you getting at that time from the things of which you are now ashamed? The end of those things is death.  But now that you have been <span class="underline">set free from sin and have become slaves of God, the fruit you get leads to sanctification and its end, eternal life.  For the wages of sin is death, but the free gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord</span>.

There are sinning people that alienate themselves from the life of God because of the ignorance that is in them, due to their hardness of heart:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>

<p>
But having been taught in Jesus, the truth which is in Jesus, to put off the old self and to be renewed in the spirit our our mind, and put on the new self, created after the likeness of God in true righteousness:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Ephesians 4:21-24</b> - assuming that you have heard about him and were taught in him, as the truth is in Jesus, to put off your old self, which belongs to your former manner of life and is corrupt through deceitful desires, and to be renewed in the spirit of your minds, and to put on the new self, created after the likeness of God in true righteousness and holiness.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Speak the truth and do not sin:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Ephesians 4:25-27</b> - Therefore, having put away falsehood, let each one of you speak the truth with his neighbor, for we are members one of another. Be angry and do not sin; do not let the sun go down on your anger, and give no opportunity to the devil.

<p>

<p>
A person must <b>do</b> the will <b>of Father God</b> (not their own will); They must be obedient.
Faith and obedience are inseparable.

<p>
To be fruitful, a person must be further obedient after arriving at the knowledge of the truth and supplement their faith with Christian virtues:

<p>
We must take hold of the eternal life to which we are called.
We made the confession to eternal life, and we must now fight the good fight of the faith, until after being slaves to righteousness, obeying Jesus, we are sanctified and receive eternal life.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>I Timothy 6:11-16</b> - But as for you, O man of God, flee these things. Pursue righteousness, godliness, faith, love, steadfastness, gentleness.  Fight the good fight of the faith. Take hold of the eternal life to which you were called and about which you made the good confession in the presence of many witnesses.  I charge you in the presence of God, who gives life to all things, and of Christ Jesus, who in his testimony before Pontius Pilate made the good confession, to <span class="underline">keep the commandment unstained and free from reproach until the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ</span>, which he will display at the proper time—he who is the blessed and only Sovereign, the King of kings and Lord of lords, who alone has immortality, who dwells in unapproachable light, whom no one has ever seen or can see. To him be honor and eternal dominion. Amen.

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Matthew 7:21-23</b> - Not everyone who says to me, Lord, Lord, will enter the kingdom of heaven, but the one who does the will of my Father who is in heaven. On that day many will say to me, Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in your name, and cast out demons in your name, and do many mighty works in your name? And then will I declare to them, I never knew you; depart from me, you workers of lawlessness. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
So those people doing works in Jesus' name were still disobedient, similar to the following example:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Leviticus 10:1-2</b> - Now Nadab and Abihu, the sons of Aaron, each took his censer and put fire in it and laid incense on it and offered unauthorized fire before the Lord, which he had not commanded them. And fire came out from before the Lord and consumed them, and they died before the Lord.
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>John 11:41-42</b> - So they took away the stone. And Jesus lifted up his eyes and said, Father, I thank you that you have heard me. I knew that you always hear me, but I said this on account of the people standing around, that they may believe that you sent me.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The works have to be the will of Father God. Initially, and ongoing, this is believing in Him whom He has sent. It's believing in Jesus, and continuing to believe in Jesus, putting your trust in Jesus, having faith in Jesus, obeying Jesus and submitting to the righteousness of God.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>John 6:29</b> - Jesus answered them, This is the work of God, that you <b>believe in him whom he has sent</b>. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Being a servant of Christ <b>from the heart</b> is doing the will of God.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Ephesians 6:6</b> - not by the way of eye-service, as people-pleasers, but as <b>servants of Christ</b>, doing the will of God <b>from the heart</b>,
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Repenting from sin is doing the will of God.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>I Thessalonians 4:3</b> - For this is the will of God, your sanctification: that you abstain from sexual immorality;
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Doing good is doing the will of God.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>I Peter 2:15</b> - For this is the will of God, that by doing good you should put to silence the ignorance of foolish people.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Doing the will of God, a person will have eternal life.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>I John 2:17</b> - And the world is passing away along with its desires, but whoever does the will of God abides forever. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Surely, the Bible teaches that all of these together are the will of God, and not simply one of them without the others.

<p>
<b>James 1:1-5</b> - James, a bond-servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ, To the twelve tribes who are dispersed abroad: Greetings.

And let endurance have its perfect result, so that you may be perfect and complete, lacking in nothing.  But if any of you lacks wisdom, let him ask of God, who gives to all generously and without reproach, and it will be given to him.

</blockquote>

<p>
The one who does not doubt is unwavering and is not tossed around by the sea.
Therefore, it's an ongoing thing.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>James 1:6</b> - But he must ask in faith (G4102 <b>pistis</b>) without any doubting (G1252 <b>diakrino</b>), for the one who doubts (G1252 diakrino) is like the surf of the sea, driven and tossed by the wind. (NASB)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
But for our prayer requests to be answered this way, we must be keeping His commandments and do what pleases Him:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>I John 3:21-24</b> - Beloved, if our heart does not condemn us, we have confidence before God; and <span class="underline">whatever we ask we receive from him</span>, because we keep his commandments and do what pleases him. And this is his commandment, that we believe in the name of his Son Jesus Christ and love one another, just as he has commanded us. Whoever keeps his commandments abides in him, and he in them. And by this we know that he abides in us, by the Spirit whom he has given us. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Proverbs 14:26</b> - In the fear of the LORD one has strong confidence, and his children will have a refuge. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Faith begins and continues:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>be walking in obedience</li>
<li>no doubting</li>
<li>no wavering</li>
<li>no withdrawing</li>
<li>no hesitating</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Mark 11:22-23</b> - And Jesus answered them, Have faith in God. Truly, I say to you, whoever says to this mountain, Be taken up and thrown into the sea, and does not doubt in his heart, but believes that what he says <span class="underline">will come to pass</span>, it will be done for him.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Walk in what you have asked for in prayer:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Mark 11:24</b> - Therefore I tell you, whatever you ask in prayer, believe that you have received it, and it <span class="underline">will be</span> yours.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
It's important to forgive others in order to move forward, because unforgiveness I think may inhibit moving into what you have asked for in prayer:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Mark 11:25</b> - And whenever you stand praying, forgive, if you have anything against anyone, so that your Father also who is in heaven may forgive you your trespasses.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
We must receive Jesus' words, walk in them and come to <b>know in truth</b> (we must truly know) that Jesus came from God.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>John 17:8</b> - For I have given them the words that you gave me, and they have received them and have <b>come to know in truth that I came from you</b>; and they have believed that you sent me.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Therefore, we should obey Jesus and arrive at the truth. Obedience is a part of faith. Like Abraham obeying God, or like Israel crossing through the Red Sea, it's obedience which leads to sure belief.
And the obedience doesn't end.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>John 8:31-32</b> - So Jesus was saying to those Jews who had believed Him, “If you <b>continue in My word</b>, then you are truly disciples of Mine; and <b>you will know the truth</b>, and the truth will make you free.” (NASB)

<p>
<b>Galatians 3:21-24</b> - Is the law then contrary to the promises of God? Certainly not! For if a law had been given that could give life, then righteousness would indeed be by the law. But the Scripture imprisoned everything under sin, so that the promise by faith in Jesus Christ might be given to those who believe.

Paul seems to refer to the Mosaic law as the ministry of death, and Paul refers to the ministry of the Spirit of Christ as giving life:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>II Corinthians 3:6-9</b> - who has made us competent to be ministers of a new covenant, not of the letter but of the Spirit. For the letter kills, but the Spirit gives life. Now if the ministry of death, carved in letters on stone, came with such glory that the Israelites could not gaze at Moses' face because of its glory, which was being brought to an end, will not the ministry of the Spirit have even more glory? For if there was glory in the ministry of condemnation, the ministry of righteousness must far exceed it in glory. (ESV)

And we are also cleaned up through faith in Jesus, being led by His Spirit, following His commandments, helping us to meet the requirement of the law, not by trying to be justified through perfect Mosaic law-keeping but instead by having faith in Jesus Christ, following <b>Christ's law</b>:

<p>
Faith is how we receive the propitiation by His blood. God justifies the one who <b>has</b> (continues having) faith in Jesus. The law of faith is what we keep:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Romans 3:20-27</b> - For by works of the law no human being will be justified in his sight, since through the law comes knowledge of sin. But now the righteousness of God has been manifested apart from the law, although the Law and the Prophets bear witness to it— the righteousness of God through faith in Jesus Christ for all who believe. For there is no distinction: for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God, and are justified by his grace as a gift, through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus, whom God put forward as a propitiation by his blood, <b>to be received by faith</b>. This was to show God's righteousness, because in his divine forbearance he had passed over former sins. It was to show his righteousness at the present time, so that he might be just and the justifier of the one who has faith in Jesus. Then what becomes of our boasting? It is excluded. By what kind of law? By a law of works? No, but by the law of faith.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Yes, the requirement of the <b>law</b> might be fulfilled in us, who do something i.e. walk according to the spirit.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Romans 8:4</b> - in order that the righteous requirement of the law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not according to the flesh but according to the Spirit.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The mind set on the spirit submits to the law:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Romans 8:5-7</b> - For those who live according to the flesh set their minds on the things of the flesh, but those who live according to the Spirit set their minds on the things of the Spirit.  To set the mind on the flesh is death, but to set the mind on the Spirit is life and peace.  For the mind that is set on the flesh is hostile to God, for it does not submit to God's law; indeed, it cannot.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
See, Jesus actually taught people to practice, but without hypocrisy:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Matthew 23:2-7</b> - The scribes and the Pharisees sit on Moses' seat, so practice and observe whatever they tell you—but not what they do. For they preach, but do not practice. They tie up heavy burdens, hard to bear, and lay them on people's shoulders, but they themselves are not willing to move them with their finger. They do all their deeds to be seen by others. For they make their phylacteries broad and their fringes long, and they love the place of honor at feasts and the best seats in the synagogues and greetings in the marketplaces and being called rabbi by others. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The law is not of the flesh. The law is spiritual:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Romans 7:14</b> - For we know that the law is spiritual, but I am of the flesh, sold under sin. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
But the Spirit helps us to put to death the deeds of the flesh.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Galatians 5:19</b> - Now the works of the flesh are evident: sexual immorality, impurity, sensuality,
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Romans 8:10-13</b> - But if Christ is in you, although the body is dead because of sin, the Spirit is life because of righteousness. If the Spirit of him who raised Jesus from the dead dwells in you, he who raised Christ Jesus from the dead will also give life to your mortal bodies through his Spirit who dwells in you. So then, brothers, we are debtors, not to the flesh, to live according to the flesh. For if you live according to the flesh you will die, but if by the Spirit you put to death the deeds of the body, you will live.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
If I understand correctly, the Law, which is spiritual, was weakened by
our flesh, but Jesus Christ's flesh was rent
on the cross in order that the righteous
requirement of the law might be fulfilled in
us, who don't walk according to the flesh, but who walk according to the Spirit:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Romans 8:3-4</b> - For God has done what the law, weakened by the flesh, could not do. By sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh and for sin, he condemned sin in the flesh, in order that the righteous requirement of the law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not according to the flesh but according to the Spirit. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Paul says that pursuing the righteousness that is by Mosaic law, is placing confidence in the flesh:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Philippians 3:4-7</b> - though I myself have reason for confidence in the flesh also. If anyone else thinks he has reason for confidence in the flesh, I have more: circumcised on the eighth day, of the people of Israel, of the tribe of Benjamin, a Hebrew of Hebrews; as to the law, a Pharisee; as to zeal, a persecutor of the church; as to righteousness, under the law blameless. But whatever gain I had, I counted as loss for the sake of Christ. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
But to put confidence in the Spirit is to not to abandon obedience, but to seek instead to know Christ Jesus, our Lord, with obedient faith to Jesus:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Philippians 3:8-11</b> - Indeed, I count everything as loss because of the surpassing worth of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord. For his sake I have suffered the loss of all things and count them as rubbish, in order that I may gain Christ and be found in him, not having a righteousness of my own that comes from the law, but that which comes through faith in Christ, the righteousness from God that depends on faith— that I may know him and the power of his resurrection, and may share his sufferings, becoming like him in his death, that by any means possible I may attain the resurrection from the dead. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
So we still must/should stop sinning after getting born-again, but <b>the Holy Spirit</b> helps us to do that.
God saves us from sin by giving us immediate justification through faith to be in relationship with Him, plus the strength to stop sinning.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>II Peter 2:2-4</b> - And many will follow their sensuality, and because of them <span class="underline">the way of truth</span> will be blasphemed. And in their greed they will exploit you with false words. Their condemnation from long ago is not idle, and their destruction is not asleep. For if God did not spare angels when they sinned, but cast them into hell and committed them to chains of gloomy darkness to be kept until the judgment;
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>II Peter 2:19-20</b> - They promise them freedom, but they themselves are slaves of corruption. For <span class="underline">whatever overcomes a person, to that he is enslaved</span>. For if, after they have escaped the defilements of the world through the knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, they are again entangled in them and overcome, the last state has become worse for them than the first.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Therefore, the way of truth involves following Jesus and putting a stop to sin.

There is only one who is good. If you would enter life, keep the commandments. He said to him, Which ones? And Jesus said, You shall not murder, You shall not commit adultery, You shall not steal, You shall not bear false witness, Honor your father and mother, and, You shall love your neighbor as yourself. The young man said to him, All these I have kept. What do I still lack? Jesus said to him, If you would be perfect, go, sell what you possess and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; and come, follow me. When the young man heard this he went away sorrowful, for he had great possessions. And Jesus said to his disciples, Truly, I say to you, only with difficulty will a rich person enter the kingdom of heaven. Again I tell you, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich person to enter the kingdom of God. When the disciples heard this, they were greatly astonished, saying, Who then can be saved? But Jesus looked at them and said, With man this is impossible, but with God all things are possible.

<p>
The guy was still coveting his possessions. To find life, one needs to let go of covetousness:
</p>

Now obeying God is more than just believing, it's obeying (which is proportional to the magnitude of the faith).

Understand that the ones who remained in the boat and did not step out onto the water did not have enough faith to walk on water.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Matthew 14:27-32</b> - But immediately Jesus spoke to them, saying, Take heart; it is I. Do not be afraid. And Peter answered him, Lord, if it is you, <b>command</b> me to come to you on the water. He said, Come. So Peter <b>got out of the boat and walked on the water and came to Jesus</b>. But when he saw the wind, he was afraid, and beginning to sink he cried out, Lord, save me. Jesus immediately reached out his hand and took hold of him, saying to him, O you of little faith, why did you doubt? And when they got into the boat, the wind ceased.

<p>
Fear made them disobedient. They had only a small amount of faith.

How unsearchable are his judgments and how inscrutable his ways!

<p>
The obedient are led by the Spirit of God. But it isn't a Spirit of slavery, it's a Spirit of sonship, where we get to be conformed to the image of Christ!:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Romans 8:12-15</b> - So then, brothers, we are debtors, not to the flesh, to live according to the flesh. For if you live according to the flesh you will die, but if by the Spirit you put to death the deeds of the body, you will live. For all who are led by the Spirit of God are sons of God.

<p>
Even as we are going through hardship for following Jesus, we should rejoice because we are more than conquerors through Him who loved us:

<blockquote>

<b>Romans 8:36-39</b> - As it is written, For your sake we are being killed all the day long; we are regarded as sheep to be slaughtered. No, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him who loved us.

I think it's important to take in all the words which Jesus spoke which are available to us, and to come to a faith which is able to reconcile faith with works, and law and obedience, and the gospel Jesus taught before and after the resurrection, and reconcile the teachings of the epistles from Peter, Paul and John, and Epistle to the Hebrews.

On 2 Jan 2023 I had a dream of defending a house with Bible verses written
on the doorposts.
</p>

<p>
I didn't know this was Biblical until very recently:
</p>

<p>
<b>Luke 4:11-13</b> - and On their hands they will bear you up, lest you strike your foot against a stone. And Jesus answered him, It is said, You shall not put the Lord your God to the test. And when the devil had ended every temptation, he departed from him until an opportune time. (ESV)

</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Jeremiah 23:1-40</b> - <span class="underline">Woe to the shepherds who destroy and scatter the sheep of my pasture!</span> declares the LORD. Therefore thus says the LORD, the God of Israel, concerning the shepherds who care for my people: You have scattered my flock and have driven them away, and you have not attended to them. Behold, I will attend to you for your evil deeds, declares the LORD. Then I will gather the remnant of my flock out of all the countries where I have driven them, and I will bring them back to their fold, and they shall be fruitful and multiply. <span class="underline">I will set shepherds over them who will care for them, and they shall fear no more, nor be dismayed, neither shall any be missing, declares the LORD.</span> Behold, the days are coming, declares the LORD, when I will raise up for David a righteous Branch, and he shall reign as king and deal wisely, and shall execute justice and righteousness in the land. In his days Judah will be saved, and Israel will dwell securely. And this is the name by which he will be called: The LORD is our righteousness. Therefore, behold, the days are coming, declares the LORD, when they shall no longer say, As the LORD lives who brought up the people of Israel out of the land of Egypt, but As the LORD lives who brought up and led the offspring of the house of Israel out of the north country and out of all the countries where he had driven them. Then they shall dwell in their own land. Concerning the prophets: My heart is broken within me; all my bones shake; I am like a drunken man, like a man overcome by wine, because of the LORD and because of his holy words. For <span class="underline">the land is full of adulterers;</span> because of the curse the land mourns, and the pastures of the wilderness are dried up. Their course is evil, and their might is not right. Both prophet and priest are ungodly; <span class="underline">even in my house I have found their evil,</span> declares the LORD. Therefore their way shall be to them like slippery paths in the darkness, into which they shall be driven and fall, for I will bring disaster upon them in the year of their punishment, declares the LORD. In the prophets of Samaria I saw an unsavory thing: they prophesied by Baal and led my people Israel astray. But in the prophets of Jerusalem I have seen a horrible thing: <b>they commit adultery and walk in lies; they strengthen the hands of evildoers, so that no one turns from his evil;</b> all of them have become like Sodom to me, and its inhabitants like Gomorrah. Therefore thus says the LORD of hosts concerning the prophets: Behold, I will feed them with bitter food and give them poisoned water to drink, for from the prophets of Jerusalem ungodliness has gone out into all the land. Thus says the LORD of hosts: <span class="underline">Do not listen to the words of the prophets who prophesy to you, filling you with vain hopes. They speak visions of their own minds, not from the mouth of the LORD.</span> <b>They say continually to those who despise the word of the LORD, It shall be well with you; and to everyone who stubbornly follows his own heart, they say, No disaster shall come upon you.</b> For who among them has stood in the council of the LORD to see and to hear his word, or who has paid attention to his word and listened? Behold, the storm of the LORD! Wrath has gone forth, a whirling tempest; it will burst upon the head of the wicked. The anger of the LORD will not turn back until he has executed and accomplished the intents of his heart. In the latter days you will understand it clearly. <span class="underline">I did not send the prophets, yet they ran; I did not speak to them, yet they prophesied.</span> But if they had stood in my council, then they would have proclaimed my words to my people, and they would have turned them from their evil way, and from the evil of their deeds. Am I a God at hand, declares the LORD, and not a God afar off? Can a man hide himself in secret places so that I cannot see him? declares the LORD. Do I not fill heaven and earth? declares the LORD. <span class="underline">I have heard what the prophets have said who prophesy lies in my name, saying, I have dreamed, I have dreamed! How long shall there be lies in the heart of the prophets who prophesy lies, and who prophesy the deceit of their own heart,</span> who think to make my people forget my name by their dreams that they tell one another, even as their fathers forgot my name for Baal? <b>Let the prophet who has a dream tell the dream, but let him who has my word speak my word faithfully.</b> What has straw in common with wheat? declares the LORD. Is not my word like fire, declares the LORD, and like a hammer that breaks the rock in pieces? Therefore, behold, I am against the prophets, declares the LORD, who steal my words from one another. Behold, I am against the prophets, declares the LORD, who use their tongues and declare, declares the LORD. <span class="underline">Behold, I am against those who prophesy lying dreams, declares the LORD, and who tell them and lead my people astray by their lies and their recklessness, when I did not send them or charge them.</span> So they do not profit this people at all, declares the LORD. When one of this people, or a prophet or a priest asks you, What is the burden of the LORD? you shall say to them, You are the burden, and I will cast you off, declares the LORD. And as for the prophet, priest, or one of the people who says, The burden of the LORD, I will punish that man and his household. Thus shall you say, every one to his neighbor and every one to his brother, What has the LORD answered? or What has the LORD spoken? But the burden of the LORD you shall mention no more, for the burden is every man's own word, and <span class="underline">you pervert the words of the living God,</span> the LORD of hosts, our God. Thus you shall say to the prophet, What has the LORD answered you? or What has the LORD spoken? But if you say, The burden of the LORD, thus says the LORD, Because you have said these words, The burden of the LORD, when I sent to you, saying, You shall not say, The burden of the LORD, therefore, behold, I will surely lift you up and cast you away from my presence, you and the city that I gave to you and your fathers. And I will bring upon you everlasting reproach and perpetual shame, which shall not be forgotten. (ESV)

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-16-5">
<p>
I think God wants us to be born-again and move on from the old life,
not asking us to renovate our old life.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>I Corinthians 5:7</b> - Cleanse out the old leaven that you may be a new lump, as you really are unleavened. For Christ, our Passover lamb, has been sacrificed. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Renovating is seeking to establish ones own righteousness while not submitting to God's righteousness.
Following God's commandments is great - a person can renovate for a while but when presented with the Gospel of Jesus they <b>must</b> submit to God's righteousness and have faith in Jesus.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Romans 10:3-4</b> - For, being ignorant of the righteousness that comes from God, and seeking to establish their own, they did not submit to God's righteousness. For Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to everyone who believes (G4100 <b>pisteuo</b> has <span class="underline">faith</span> in Jesus).
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Seek God's kingdom and His righteousness first of all:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Matthew 6:33</b> - But seek first the kingdom of God and his righteousness, and all these things will be added to you. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Renovating (bad):
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Disobedient to the gospel
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Pursues the fruit of righteousness but trying to establish a righteousness of their own without submitting to the righteousness of God.</li>
<li>Working for justification outside of faith / obedience</li>
<li>Tries to have the 'holiness' without Jesus.</li>
<li>Has not obeyed the gospel.</li>
<li>Never died with Jesus.</li>
<li>From God's perspective even when they forgive others, it's out of self-righteousness.</li>
<li>Forgiving is still good but they still need to submit to the righteousness of God, by believing and obeying the gospel of Jesus.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Romans 4:4</b> - Now to the one who works, his wages are not counted as a gift but as his due.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The devil does not submit to Jesus. So anyone who doesn't submit to the righteousness of God, instead sides with the devil.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>II Corinthians 11:14-15</b> - And no wonder, for even Satan disguises himself as an angel of light. So it is no surprise if his servants, also, disguise themselves as servants of righteousness. Their end will correspond to their deeds.

<p>
Innovating (good):
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The fruit of the Spirit is fruit (it comes after receiving <b>the Holy Spirit</b>).</li>
<li>Obey the gospel for justification.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Christ is the head.</li>
<li>Died and rose with Jesus.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><b>II Timothy 2:11-13</b> - The saying is trustworthy, for: If we have died with him, we will also live with him; if we endure, we will also reign with him; if we deny him, he also will deny us; if we are faithless, he remains faithful— for he cannot deny himself.</li>
<li><b>Ephesians 2:6</b> - and <span class="underline">raised us up with him</span> and seated us with him in the heavenly places in Christ Jesus,</li>
<li><b>Colossians 2:12</b> - having been <span class="underline">buried with him</span> in baptism, in which you were <span class="underline">also raised with him through faith in the powerful working of God</span>, who raised him from the dead.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Raised with Christ through faith in the powerful working of God.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><b>Colossians 3:3</b> - For you have died, and your life is hidden with Christ in God.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Now live to serve Christ.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><b>II Corinthians 5:15</b> - and he died for all, that those who live might no longer live for themselves but for him who for their sake died and was raised.</li>
<li><b>Colossians 3:1</b> - If then you have been raised with Christ, seek the things that are above, where Christ is, seated at the right hand of God.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Approaches Christ-likeness following Jesus.</li>
<li>Having accepted their own need of forgiveness, and having been forgiven <b>then</b> forgives others who don't even see their need of forgiveness.</li>
<li><b>freely</b> forgives:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><b>Matthew 18:21-22</b> -  Then Peter came up and said to him, Lord, how often will my brother sin against me, and I forgive him?  As many as seven times?  Jesus said to him, I do not say to you seven times, but seventy times seven. (ESV)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>forgives even those who do not see their need of forgiveness:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><b>Luke 23:33-35</b> - And when they came to the place that is called The Skull, there they crucified him, and the criminals, one on his right and one on his left.  And Jesus said, Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do. And they cast lots to divide his garments.  And the people stood by, watching, but the rulers scoffed at him, saying, He saved others; let him save himself, if he is the Christ of God, his Chosen One! (ESV)</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Ephesians 4:32</b> - Be kind to one another, tenderhearted, forgiving one another, as God in Christ forgave you. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
We must forgive others the same way that God in Christ forgave us.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Colossians 2:14</b> - by canceling the record of debt that stood against us with its legal demands. This he set aside, nailing it to the cross.
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Luke 11:4</b> - and forgive us our sins, for we ourselves forgive everyone who is indebted to us. And lead us not into temptation.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
It's necessary to submit to the righteousness of God:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>You have accepted that you needed forgiveness from God.</li>
<li>You have accepted that it's through the shedding of the blood of Jesus Christ that God has forgiven you, forgiving a debt which was impossible for you to pay.</li>
<li>Forgive others freely, knowing you've been forgiven of your sin. Give freely. Forgive the debt of others towards you. That looks like being a scapegoat and letting oneself be fleeced. Imagine you've just been born-again but noone else knows. You know you must forgive others. You know God can see your heart. Now all of a sudden people make these claims that you owe them X, Y and Z. You know you've been forgiven of a debt you were not able to pay. Now instead of contesting others on whether or not you owe them, you give freely. Seventy-times-seven.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Self-righteous forgiveness:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Conditional forgiveness (not freely)</li>
<li>Self-righteously forgive others as if you're perfectly innocent and of course they sinned against innocence by sinning against you</li>
<li>Without accepting that you needed the forgiveness which Jesus has paid through His blood, you then forgive others
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>This tries to establish one's own righteousness without submitting to the righteousness of God</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Believing that you're already good with God and never needed Jesus
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>not prepared to forgive freely</li>
<li>but not having yet submitted to the fact that you need forgiveness from God.</li>
<li>Forgiving others is good to do, but without having truly accepted that you needed forgiveness yourself, you'd still be forgiving others out of debt to God.</li>
<li>I think it's impossible to have Christ's heart without having first accepted being forgiven by Jesus</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Do not accept that one needs or ever needed forgiveness from God.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>That actually means that person's forgiveness is at least a bit self-righteous (at least from God's perspective)
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>They do not give out of credit, but while indebted to God, they still give God what is due by forgiving others their offenses towards them
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>nevertheless, a person can never achieve perfect right standing with God without submitting to the righteousness of God through faith in Christ and accepting the atonement which Jesus has purchased through His blood</li>

The Son of Man will send his angels, <span class="underline">and they will gather out of his kingdom all causes of sin and all law-breakers, and throw them into the fiery furnace</span>.

<blockquote>
<p>

The Law (Torah) came in to increase the tresspass:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Romans 5:19-21</b> - For as by the one man's disobedience the many were made sinners, so by the one man's obedience the many will be made righteous. Now the law came in to increase the trespass, but where sin increased, grace abounded all the more, so that, as sin reigned in death, grace also might reign through righteousness leading to eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
OK, so being baptised into Christ Jesus' death,
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Romans 6:1-3</b> - What shall we say then? Are we to continue in sin that grace may abound? By no means! How can we who died to sin still live in it? Do you not know that all of us who have been baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into his death? (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
with a death like His,
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Romans 6:4-5</b> - We were buried therefore with him by baptism into death, in order that, just as Christ was raised from the dead by the glory of the Father, we too might walk in newness of life. For if we have been united with him in a death like his, we shall certainly be united with him in a resurrection like his. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
our old self crucified,
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Romans 6:6-9</b> - We know that our old self was crucified with him in order that the body of sin might be brought to nothing, so that we would no longer be enslaved to sin. For one who has died has been set free from sin. Now if we have died with Christ, we believe that we will also live with him. We know that Christ being raised from the dead will never die again; death no longer has dominion over him. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
we live to serve God now, but that isn't achieved by putting ourselves under the Torah, but it <b>does</b> mean obeying God through serving Christ:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Romans 6:10-11</b> - For the death he died he died to sin, once for all, but the life he lives he lives to God. So you also must consider yourselves dead to sin and alive to God in Christ Jesus. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
We still must cease from sinning, and we must serve God, and follow Jesus' commandments, but we are under grace while we do this:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Romans 6:12-13</b> - Let not sin therefore reign in your mortal bodies, to make you obey their passions. Do not present your members to sin as instruments for unrighteousness, but present yourselves to God as those who have been brought from death to life, and your members to God as instruments for righteousness. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
We are under grace now. We're not slaves to the Mosaic Law:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Romans 6:14-15</b> - For sin will have no dominion over you, since you are not under law but under grace. What then? Are we to sin because we are not under law but under grace? By no means! (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
But we are obedient slaves now to righteousness, slaves of God, as slaves of Christ:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Romans 6:16-18</b> - Do you not know that if you present yourselves to anyone as obedient slaves, you are slaves of the one whom you obey, either of sin, which leads to death, or of obedience, which leads to righteousness? But thanks be to God, that you who were once slaves of sin have become obedient <b>from the heart</b> to the standard of teaching to which you were committed, and, having been set free from sin, have become slaves of righteousness. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
We no longer present our members as slaves to impurity (sin):
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Romans 6:19</b> - I am speaking in human terms, because of your natural limitations. For just as you once presented your members as slaves to impurity and to lawlessness leading to more lawlessness, so now present your members as slaves to righteousness leading to sanctification. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
There was no warring between the spirit and the flesh before I was born-again, and now while by the spirit I desire to comply with God's commandments with my mind, the flesh seems to rebel against the spirit:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Romans 6:20</b> - When you were slaves of sin, you were free in regard to righteousness. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Galatians 5:16-17</b> - But I say, walk by the Spirit, and you will not gratify the desires of the flesh. For the desires of the flesh are against the Spirit, and the desires of the Spirit are against the flesh, for these are opposed to each other, to keep you from doing the things you want to do. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
My past behaviour would have led to death:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Romans 6:21</b> - But what fruit were you getting at that time from the things of which you are now ashamed? The end of those things is death. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
So we should be slaves to God now. But this doesn't mean putting ourselves 'under the Torah', because the spirit helps us to keep the higher precepts of the Law, to love God and our neighbour and follow Jesus Christ's commandments:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Romans 6:22-23</b>- But now that you have been set free from sin and have become slaves of God, the fruit you get leads to sanctification and its end, eternal life. For the wages of sin is death, but the free gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Clearly there is a difference between actually keeping / complying with the commandments of God and placing oneself under the Torah, because a new creation still <span class="underline">keeps the commandments of God</span>:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Romans 2:29</b> - But he is a Jew who is one inwardly; and <b>circumcision is that which is of the heart, by the Spirit</b>, not by the letter; and his praise is not from men, but from God.
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>I Corinthians 7:19</b> - For <span class="underline">neither circumcision counts for anything nor uncircumcision,</span> but <b>keeping the commandments of God.</b> (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Also, Christ's law is within the Law of God:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>I Corinthians 9:21</b> - To those outside the law I became as one outside the law (not being outside the law of God but <span class="underline">under the law of Christ</span>) that I might win those outside the law.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The Spirit helps us to <b>actually</b> fulfill the requirement of the Law. We do this not putting ourself under the Torah as a yoke of slavery, but by walking according to the Spirit, being a slave to Christ Jesus:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Romans 8:4</b> - in order that the righteous requirement of the law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not according to the flesh but according to the Spirit. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
OK, so in Christ Jesus, having received the Spirit, being a slave of Christ, being yoked to Christ, we are set free:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Galatians 5:1</b> - For freedom Christ has set us free; stand firm therefore, and do not submit again to a yoke of slavery. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The Law (Torah), though it still exists, shouldn't be our Master once we are placed into the body of Christ and receive the Spirit:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Romans 7:1-3</b> - Or do you not know, brothers—for I am speaking to those who know the law—that the law is binding on a person only as long as he lives? Thus a married woman is bound by law to her husband while he lives, but if her husband dies she is released from the law of marriage. Accordingly, she will be called an adulteress if she lives with another man while her husband is alive. But if her husband dies, she is free from that law, and if she marries another man she is not an adulteress. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Having <b>died to the Law (Torah)</b> through the body of Christ - <b>so that we may belong to another</b>, Christ:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Romans 7:4</b> - Likewise, my brothers, you also have died to the law through the body of Christ, <b>so that you may belong to another</b>, to him who has been raised from the dead, <b>in order that we may bear fruit for God.</b> (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
We die to the Law to be slaves of God with Christ in us.
</p>

<p>
<b>If</b> we live in the flesh, then the Law (Torah) arouses our sinful passions:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Romans 7:5</b> - For while we were living in the flesh, our sinful passions, aroused by the law, were at work in our members to bear fruit for death. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
We no longer serve God under the old written code but we now serve Him in the new life of the Spirit:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Romans 7:6</b> - But now we are released from the law, having died to that which held us captive, so that we serve not under the old written code but in the new life of the Spirit. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
When Paul mentions 'commandment' here, he's talking about "You shall not covet":
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Romans 7:7</b> - What then shall we say? That the law is sin? By no means! Yet if it had not been for the law, I would not have known sin. I would not have known what it is to covet if the law had not said, You shall not covet. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Knowledge of the Torah appears to 'make sin come alive'. Paul mentions the Law (Torah) as including the commandments:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Romans 7:8-11</b> - But sin, seizing an opportunity through the commandment, produced in me all kinds of covetousness. Apart from the law, sin lies dead. I was once alive apart from the law, but when the commandment came, sin came alive and I died. The very commandment that promised life proved to be death to me. For sin, seizing an opportunity through the commandment, deceived me and through it killed me. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
OK, so the Law (Torah) and the commandments within are holy and righteous and good, but because of the sin in us, the commandments exposes the sin in us, and even causes it to manifest.
</p>

<p>
OK, so the way the Law (Torah) currently still exists, while true, is used for us as some kind of means of exposing sin:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Romans 7:12-13</b> - So the law is holy, and the commandment is holy and righteous and good. Did that which is good, then, bring death to me? By no means! It was sin, producing death in me through what is good, in order that sin might be shown to be sin, and through the commandment might become sinful beyond measure. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Sin dwells in the flesh and fights against complying with God's commandments:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Romans 7:14-17</b> - For we know that the law is spiritual, but I am of the flesh, sold under sin. I do not understand my own actions. For I do not do what I want, but I do the very thing I hate. Now if I do what I do not want, I agree with the law, that it is good. So now it is no longer I who do it, but sin that dwells within me. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
In our minds we desire to do what is right by the 10 commandments / Mosaic Law but our flesh creates problems in carrying it out:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Romans 7:18-24</b> - For I know that nothing good dwells in me, that is, in my flesh. For I have the desire to do what is right, but not the ability to carry it out. For I do not do the good I want, but the evil I do not want is what I keep on doing. Now if I do what I do not want, it is no longer I who do it, but sin that dwells within me. So I find it to be a law that when I want to do right, evil lies close at hand. For I delight in the law of God, in my inner being, but I see in my members another law waging war against the law of my mind and making me captive to the law of sin that dwells in my members. Wretched man that I am! Who will deliver me from this body of death? (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The tragedy is the flesh serves the law of sin, but in with our mind we serve the law of God, but we actually just follow Christ Jesus who has done it already perfectly, and this means we don't make the Mosaic Law our way of life, but we make Jesus our way of life:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Romans 7:25</b> - Thanks be to God through Jesus Christ our Lord! So then, I myself serve the law of God with my mind, but with my flesh I serve the law of sin. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Christ Jesus, our Lord is our righteousness. We serve Christ Jesus:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>I Corinthians 1:30</b> - He is the source of your life in Christ Jesus, whom God made our wisdom and our righteousness and sanctification and redemption. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
We want to do what is right and we don't accept condemnation for when sin in our flesh does the evil:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Romans 8:1-2</b> - <b>There is therefore now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus.</b> For the law of the Spirit of life has set you free in Christ Jesus from the law of sin and death. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Sin in the flesh has been condemned. We walk according to the Spirit:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Romans 8:3-4</b> - For God has done what the law, weakened by the flesh, could not do. By sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh and for sin, he condemned sin in the flesh, in order that the righteous requirement of the law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not according to the flesh but according to the Spirit. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Law of the Spirit: We must set our minds on the things of the Spirit:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Romans 8:5-6</b> - For those who live according to the flesh set their minds on the things of the flesh, but those who live according to the Spirit set their minds on the things of the Spirit. To set the mind on the flesh is death, but to set the mind on the Spirit is life and peace. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
We focus on the things of the Spirit, instead of the Torah, and we will naturally comply with God's precepts, his law, etc.:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Romans 8:7</b> - For the mind that is set on the flesh is hostile to God, for it does not submit to God's law; indeed, it cannot. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
We are in the Spirit now, not the flesh, and we have Christ in us, and we are not our own, by belong to Christ:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Romans 8:8-9</b> - Those who are in the flesh cannot please God. You, however, are not in the flesh but in the Spirit, if in fact the Spirit of God dwells in you. Anyone who does not have the Spirit of Christ does not belong to him. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>II Corinthians 5:16</b> - From now on, therefore, we regard no one according to the flesh. Even though we once regarded Christ according to the flesh, we regard him thus no longer. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Christ is alive in us. The body is dead because of sin:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Romans 8:10-12</b> - But if Christ is in you, although the body is dead because of sin, the Spirit is life because of righteousness. If the Spirit of him who raised Jesus from the dead dwells in you, he who raised Christ Jesus from the dead will also give life to your mortal bodies through his Spirit who dwells in you. So then, brothers, we are debtors, not to the flesh, to live according to the flesh. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
We still have to stop sinning, but this isn't by placing ourselves under the Torah. It's by getting baptised into Christ, serving God, being slaves of Christ, being led by the Spirit, doing the will of God that we put sin to death:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Romans 8:13-17</b> - For if you live according to the flesh you will die, but if by the Spirit you put to death the deeds of the body, you will live. For all who are led by the Spirit of God are sons of God. For you did not receive the spirit of slavery to fall back into fear, but you have received the Spirit of adoption as sons, by whom we cry, Abba! Father! The Spirit himself bears witness with our spirit that we are children of God, and if children, then heirs—heirs of God and fellow heirs with Christ, provided we suffer with him in order that we may also be glorified with him. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Romans 9:30-33</b> - What shall we say, then? That Gentiles who did not pursue righteousness have attained it, that is, a righteousness that is by faith; but that Israel who pursued a law that would lead to righteousness did not succeed in reaching that law. Why? Because they did not pursue it by faith, but as if it were based on works. They have stumbled over the stumbling stone, as it is written, Behold, I am laying in Zion a stone of stumbling, and a rock of offense; and whoever believes in him will not be put to shame. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Paul prays for Israel to be saved, saying they have a zeal for God, but not by actual knowledge of God:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Romans 10:1-3</b> - Brothers, my heart's desire and prayer to God for them is that they may be saved. I bear them witness that they have a zeal for God, but not according to knowledge. For, being ignorant of the righteousness that comes from God, and seeking to establish their own, they did not submit to God's righteousness.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
OK, so we need to submit to God's righteousness, and that means having faith in God for what He has done sending Jesus Christ to die on the cross for our sin and raising Him for our justification.
</p>

<p>
We need to receive the Spirit of God:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Romans 8:9</b> - You, however, are not in the flesh but in the Spirit, if in fact the Spirit of God dwells in you. Anyone who does not have the Spirit of Christ does not belong to him. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
We can still have the righteousness based on faith:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Romans 10:4</b> - For Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to everyone who believes. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Instead of thinking we must make the Torah our way of life, we simply make Jesus our Lord and Saviour:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Romans 10:5-9</b> - For Moses writes about the righteousness that is based on the law, that the person who does the commandments shall live by them. But the righteousness based on faith says, Do not say in your heart, Who will ascend into heaven? (that is, to bring Christ down) or Who will descend into the abyss? (that is, to bring Christ up from the dead). But what does it say? The word is near you, in your mouth and in your heart (that is, the word of faith that we proclaim); because, if you confess with your mouth that Jesus is Lord and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
This is submitting to the righteousness of God:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Romans 10:10</b>- For with the heart one believes and is justified, and with the mouth one confesses and is saved. (ESV)
</p>

<h3 id="orgdc15daa"><span class="section-number-3">17.3.</span> The Torah</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-17-3">
<p>
The Torah is the compilation of the first five books of the Hebrew Bible, namely the books of Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers and Deuteronomy. The Torah is known as the Pentateuch or the Five Books of Moses by Christians.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>II Timothy 3:12-17</b> - Indeed, <span class="underline">all who desire to live a godly life in Christ Jesus will be persecuted,</span> while evil people and impostors will go on from bad to worse, deceiving and being deceived. But as for you, continue in what you have learned and have firmly believed, knowing from whom you learned it and how from childhood you have been <b>acquainted with the sacred writings</b>, which <span class="underline">are able to make you wise for salvation through faith in Christ Jesus</span>. All Scripture is breathed out by God and profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, and for <span class="underline">training in righteousness, that the man of God may be competent, equipped for every good work.</span> (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Keeping to <span class="underline">the precepts of the law</span> is great, and making yourself accountable to God with it, is great.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Proverbs 28:9</b> - If one turns away his ear from hearing the law, even his prayer is an abomination. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Here, Paul actually argues <b>for</b> keeping the precepts of the Torah, and relates actually keeping the precepts to those who have been circumcised in the heart:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Romans 2:25-29</b> - For circumcision indeed is of value if you obey the law, but if you break the law, your circumcision becomes uncircumcision. So, if a man who is uncircumcised keeps <span class="underline">the precepts of the law</span>, will not his uncircumcision be regarded as circumcision? Then he who is physically uncircumcised but keeps the law will condemn you who have the written code and circumcision but break the law. For no one is a Jew who is merely one outwardly, nor is circumcision outward and physical. But <span class="underline">a Jew is one inwardly, and circumcision is a matter of the heart, by the Spirit, not by the letter.</span> His praise is not from man but from God.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
I believe what Paul says here is that Christians who observe and follow the Torah in faith, not works, not being under it (because it doesn't condemn us while we are under Christ's law), but making themselves accountable to God over it, to receive praise from God, are Christian Jews. But we don't Judaise Gentiles. And we follow Jesus Christ above all. We are slaves to Jesus Christ, not the Mosaic Law.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Luke 16:15-17</b> - And he said to them, You are those who justify yourselves before men, but God knows your hearts. For what is exalted among men is an abomination in the sight of God.  The Law and the Prophets were until John; since then the good news of the kingdom of God is preached, and everyone forces his way into it.  But it is easier for heaven and earth to pass away than for one dot of the Law to become void.
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>I Kings 11:38</b> - And if you will listen to all that I command you, and will walk in my ways, and do what is right in my eyes by keeping my statutes and my commandments, as David my servant did, I will be with you and will build you a sure house, as I built for David, and I will give Israel to you.

We must follow Jesus, similarly to how the Israelites followed Moses through the Red Sea - it requires action.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>John 12:44-50</b> - And Jesus cried out and said, Whoever believes (G4100 pisteuo) in me, believes (G4100 pisteuo) not in me but in him who sent me.  And whoever sees me sees him who sent me.  I have come into the world as light, so that whoever believes in me may not remain in darkness.  If anyone hears my words and does not keep them, I do not judge him; for I did not come to judge the world but to save the world.  The one who rejects me and does not receive my words has a judge; the word that I have spoken will judge him on the last day.  For I have not spoken on my own authority, but the Father who sent me has himself given me a commandment—what to say and what to speak.  And I know that his commandment is eternal life.  What I say, therefore, I say as the Father has told me. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
This is similar to how the Israelites trusted in Moses, and they actually were trusting in God.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Exodus 14:14-16</b> - The Lord will fight for you, and you have only to be silent.  The Lord said to Moses, Why do you cry to me? Tell the people of Israel to go forward.  Lift up your staff, and stretch out your hand over the sea and divide it, that the people of Israel may go through the sea on dry ground. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Exodus 14:21-22</b> - Then Moses stretched out his hand over the sea, and the LORD drove the sea back by a strong east wind all night and made the sea dry land, and the waters were divided. And the people of Israel went into the midst of the sea on dry ground, the waters being a wall to them on their right hand and on their left. (ESV)

<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNHKqhwu6Bo">Public Debate - Should Christians Keep The Law? - YouTube</a></li>
<li>The law is good and just and Jesus both obeyed it flawlessly, but He also fulfilled it like a prophesy.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Christians follow Jesus first and foremost:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Matthew 12:3-8</b> - He said to them, Have you not read what David did when he was hungry, and those who were with him: how he entered the house of God and ate the bread of the Presence, which it was not lawful for him to eat nor for those who were with him, but only for the priests? Or have you not read in the Law how on the Sabbath the priests in the temple profane the Sabbath and are guiltless? I tell you, <b>something greater than the temple is here.</b> And <b>if you had known what this means, I desire mercy, and not sacrifice, you would not have condemned the guiltless.</b> For <b>the Son of Man is lord of the Sabbath.</b>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Christians wish to comply with the law of God and do so in their mind, but know that the flesh is hostile to the law:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Romans 7:25</b> - Thanks be to God through Jesus Christ our Lord! So then, I myself serve the law of God with my mind, but with my flesh I serve the law of sin. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Christians comply with the law by faith, not works:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Luke 6:9</b> - And Jesus said to them, I ask you, is it lawful on the Sabbath to do good or to do harm, to save life or to destroy it? (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
God's commandments through Jesus is within the Law of God. Faith in Jesus is how we comply with the law of God:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>I Corinthians 9:21</b> - To those outside the law I became as one outside the law (not being outside the law of God but under the law of Christ) that I might win those outside the law. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Christians do not Judaize (Christians do not instruct Gentiles to conform to Judaism):
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Ignatius to the Magnesians 10</b> - Let us not, therefore, be insensible to His kindness. For were He to reward us according to our works, we should cease to be. Therefore, <b>having become His disciples, let us learn to live according to the principles of Christianity</b>. For whosoever is called by any other name besides this, is not of God. Lay aside, therefore, the evil, the old, the sour leaven, and be ye changed into the new leaven, which is Jesus Christ. Be ye salted in Him, lest any one among you should be corrupted, since by your savour ye shall be convicted. It is absurd to profess Christ Jesus, and to Judaize. For <span class="underline">Christianity did not embrace Judaism, but Judaism Christianity, that so every tongue which believeth might be gathered together to God</span>.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
I read the following as, as we have faith in Jesus, following Him, where we have fallen short, Jesus has covered us, but we still try to live righteously. We still live with faith in God.
</p>

<p>
And when we continue to sin, Jesus is our High Priest and Advocate, and covers us, as we continue to have faith in Him.
</p>

<p>
The 10 Commandments and the 2 Great commandments are special because when followed <b>from the heart</b> they show people how to love God and one's neighbour.
</p>

<p>
And we are <span class="underline">commanded</span> (even as Christians not <span class="underline">under the law</span>) to love our neighbours:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>John 15:16</b> - You did not choose me, but I chose you and appointed you that you should go and bear fruit and that your fruit should abide, so that <span class="underline">whatever you ask the Father in my name, he may give it to you</span>. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>I John 3:21-24</b> - Beloved, if our heart does not condemn us, we have confidence before God; and <span class="underline">whatever we ask we receive from him</span>, because we keep his commandments and do what pleases him. And this is his commandment, that we believe in the name of his Son Jesus Christ and love one another, just as he has commanded us. Whoever keeps his commandments abides in him, and he in them. And by this we know that he abides in us, by the Spirit whom he has given us. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The rest of the Mosaic law is still useful for training in righteousness. It shows people how to live in obedience to God and in love for God and one's neighbour. But we are not under the Mosaic law, but we are under the law of Christ. We have faith in Christ.
</p>

<p>
We can pursue the righteousness that is through faith (G4100 <b>pisteuo</b>) in Jesus Christ.
</p>

<p>
We must set our hope on Jesus, not on Moses.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>John 5:45</b> -  Do not think that I will accuse you to the Father.  There is one who accuses you: Moses, on whom you have set your hope.  (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Acts 7:35</b> - “This Moses whom they disowned, saying, ‘Who made you a ruler and a judge?’ is the one whom God sent to be both a ruler and a deliverer with the help of the angel who appeared to him in the thorn bush.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Moses wrote about Jesus:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Acts 7:37</b> - This is the Moses who said to the sons of Israel, ‘God will raise up for you a prophet like me from your brethren.’
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Moses said we must listen to Jesus:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Deuteronomy 18:15-19</b> - The LORD your God will raise up for you a prophet like me from among you, from your brothers—it is to him <span class="underline">you shall listen</span> — just as you desired of the LORD your God at Horeb on the day of the assembly, when you said, Let me not hear again the voice of the LORD my God or see this great fire any more, lest I die. And the LORD said to me, They are right in what they have spoken. I will raise up for them a prophet like you from among their brothers. And I will put my words in his mouth, and he shall speak to them all that I command him. And whoever will not listen to my words that he shall speak in my name, I myself will require it of him. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Acts 7:52-55</b> - Which one of the prophets did your fathers not persecute? They killed those who had previously announced the coming of the Righteous One, whose betrayers and murderers you have now become; you who received the law as ordained by angels, and yet did not keep it.” Now when they heard this, they were cut to the quick, and they began gnashing their teeth at him.  But being full of <b>the Holy Spirit</b>, he gazed intently into heaven and saw the glory of God, and Jesus standing at the right hand of God;
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
We must obey Jesus:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Romans 10:4</b> - For Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to everyone who believes (G4100 <b>pisteuo</b> has <span class="underline">faith</span> in Jesus).
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
(G4100 <b>pisteuo</b>) is <span class="underline">practicing</span> faith.
</p>

<p>
This means, yes that by practicing faith in Jesus, we can pursue righteousness - Jesus' righteousness given to us.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>II Peter 1:1</b> - Simeon Peter, a servant and apostle of Jesus Christ, To those who have obtained a faith of equal standing with ours by the righteousness of our God and Savior Jesus Christ:
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
We obtain a strong faith by the righteousness of Jesus Christ.
</p>

<p>
This requires obedience to Jesus:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>John 15:16</b> - You did not choose me, but I chose you and appointed you that you should go and bear fruit and that your fruit should abide, so that <span class="underline">whatever you ask the Father in my name, he may give it to you</span>. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
A person must receive the word:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>and not fall away</li>
<li>and not let worldly desire distract from, and inhibit following and seeking Jesus</li>
<li>and bear fruit</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Mark 4:14-20</b> - <span class="underline">The sower sows the word.</span> And these are the ones along the path, where the word is sown: when they hear, Satan immediately comes and takes away the word that is sown in them. And these are the ones sown on rocky ground: the ones who, when they hear the word, immediately receive it with joy. And they have no root in themselves, but endure for a while; then, when tribulation or persecution arises on account of the word, immediately they fall away. And others are the ones sown among thorns. They are those who hear the word, but the cares of the world and the deceitfulness of riches and the desires for other things enter in and choke the word, and it proves unfruitful. But <span class="underline">those that were sown on the good soil are the ones who hear the word and accept it and bear fruit, thirtyfold and sixtyfold and a hundredfold.</span>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Because we keep His commandments, we receive from him whatever we ask.
And our heart does not condemn us.
And we have confidence before God.
</p>

<p>
By this we know <span class="underline">he</span> abides in <span class="underline">us</span>:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>He has given us His Spirit.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>I John 3:21-24</b> - Beloved, if our heart does not condemn us, we have confidence before God; and <span class="underline">whatever we ask we receive from him</span>, because we keep his commandments and do what pleases him. And this is his commandment, that we believe in the name of his Son Jesus Christ and love one another, just as he has commanded us. Whoever keeps his commandments abides in him, and he in them. And by this we know that he abides in us, by the Spirit whom he has given us. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
<span class="underline">We abide in Him</span>, and <span class="underline">He in us.</span>
</p>

<p>
We keep His commandments, and we abide in Him:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>John 15:10</b> - If you keep my commandments, you will abide in my love, just as I have kept my Father's commandments and abide in his love.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
We are in Jesus Christ. Eternal life is in Jesus Christ:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>I John 5:20</b> - And we know that the Son of God has come and has given us understanding, so that we may know him who is true; and <b>we are in him who is true, in his Son Jesus Christ. He is the true God and eternal life.</b> (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
By having an obedient, trusting faith (which fundamentally includes belief) in Jesus, following, we have Jesus' righteousness.
</p>

<p>
I read this as we are under grace and not
under the Mosaic law, but we must bear fruit
of repentance from disbelief and sin, and
becoming good instead of evil, bearing fruit
in our life which glorifies God in our bodies,
hearts and deeds:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>obedience leads to righteousness</li>
<li>slaves to righteousness leading to sanctification
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>at its end, eternal life</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Romans 6:13-23</b> - Do not present your members to sin as instruments for unrighteousness, but present yourselves to God as those who have been brought from death to life, and your members to God as instruments for righteousness.  For sin will have no dominion over you, since you are not under law but under grace.  What then? Are we to sin because we are not under law but under grace? By no means!  Do you not know that if you present yourselves to anyone as obedient slaves, you are slaves of the one whom you obey, either of sin, which leads to death, or of <b>obedience, which leads to righteousness</b>?  But thanks be to God, that you who were once slaves of sin have become obedient <b>from the heart</b> to the standard of teaching to which you were committed, and, having been set free from sin, have become <b>slaves of righteousness</b>.  I am speaking in human terms, because of your natural limitations. For just as you once presented your members as slaves to impurity and to lawlessness leading to more lawlessness, so now present your members as <b>slaves to righteousness leading to sanctification</b>.  When you were slaves of sin, you were free in regard to righteousness.  But what fruit were you getting at that time from the things of which you are now ashamed? The end of those things is death.  But now that you have been <b>set free from sin and have become slaves of God, the fruit you get leads to sanctification and its end, eternal life</b>.  For the wages of sin is death, but the free gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.

<p>
I read this as 'A saint is someone who has faith in Jesus AND keeps the commandments (pursuing by faith, not works)'.
I read this as the Great commandments, 10 Commandments and faith in Jesus Christ, and potentially various other commandments from the Mosaic law if you know about them, or whatever subset a person practices by faith making themself accountable to God.
But the law, if it's pursued at all, should be pursued by faith and not by works.

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-22-0-2">
<p>
Also God's commandments (especially the 10 Commandments; loving God and your neighbour) are still binding on us - written on our heart when we get born-again and after being born-again we follow them in Spirit, but they don't bind on us in a way that condemns us if we  break them, but we <b>want</b> to follow them.
</p>

<p>
Jesus fulfilled the law =&gt; We have the Spirit of Christ =&gt; We are led by the Spirit and naturally want to follow the law in faith but the world opposes us because when a person actually follows the commandments, they do not lie, do not commit adultery, do not commit idolatry, etc. and that means a person can be 'taken advantage of' by unfaithful people who do not obey God's commandments but exploit others who follow God.
</p>

<p>
But we neither pursue the law by works, nor seek it to be justified.
We are freed from being under the law, and free from the curse of the law to serve and obey God in actuality, being under God's grace.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Romans 7:6</b> - But now we are released from the law, having died to that which held us captive, so that we serve not under the old written code but in the new life of the Spirit. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
I think that being led by the Spirit is still acting in a way that without observing the law is technically compliant with the law, and that is because we are led by the Spirit.
</p>

<p>
By being led by the Spirit, we are not <b>under</b> the law. And we have Jesus Christ as our Advocate and High Priest.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>I John 2:1</b> - My little children, I am writing these things to you so that you may not sin. But if anyone does sin, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Nevertheless, when we judge others by the law, we're judged by the same standard.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Matthew 7:1</b> - Judge not, that you be not judged. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
But if someone judges by the law, it seems right to submit to the law, unless it is that you are actually being obedient to Jesus (being led by the Spirit / following Jesus' commandments), in which you should carry on being obedient to Jesus. The law is meant for sinners.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Matthew 23:2-3</b> - The scribes and the Pharisees sit on Moses' seat, so practice and observe whatever they tell you—but not what they do. For they preach, but do not practice. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
We then may observe the law and keep it in faith (not adhering strictly though), and do not teach others to annul even the smallest commandment, and as we are led by the Spirit (obeying and following Jesus) we are not under the law, nor under its curse, and we are not seeking to be justified by the law, and if we are being obedient servants of Jesus then we naturally submit to / comply with God's law.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Romans 8:7</b> - For the mind that is set on the flesh is hostile to God, for it does not submit to God's law; indeed, it cannot. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
When someone uses the law to judge, comply if they are right, but do not act like the hypocrites.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>John 7:24</b> - Do not judge by appearances, but judge with right judgment.
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Matthew 23:2-7</b> - The scribes and the Pharisees sit on Moses' seat, <span class="underline">so practice and observe whatever they tell you</span> —but not what they do. For they preach, but do not practice. They tie up heavy burdens, hard to bear, and lay them on people's shoulders, but they themselves are not willing to move them with their finger. They do all their deeds to be seen by others. For they make their phylacteries broad and their fringes long, and they love the place of honor at feasts and the best seats in the synagogues and greetings in the marketplaces and being called rabbi by others. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
But the mind set on the Spirit does submit to God's law meaning that they may walk in God's statues, and therefore the mind set on the Spirit is not hostile to God.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Ezekiel 11:19-20</b> - And I will give them one heart, and a new spirit I will put within them. I will remove the heart of stone from their flesh and give them a heart of flesh, that they may walk in my statutes and keep my rules and obey them. And they shall be my people, and I will be their God. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Deuteronomy 4:13</b> - And he declared to you his covenant, which he commanded you to perform, that is, the Ten Commandments, and he wrote them on two tablets of stone.
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Romans 10:5</b> - For Moses writes about the righteousness that is based on the law, that the person who does the commandments shall live by them.
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Romans 13:9</b> - The commandments, You shall not commit adultery, You shall not murder, You shall not steal, You shall not covet, and any other commandment, are summed up in this word: You shall love your neighbor as yourself.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
There's no contradiction between what the 10 commandments say and loving one's neighbour, i.e. for the way in which we must live entering into life.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Psalms 103:17-19</b> - But the steadfast love of the Lord is from everlasting to everlasting on those who fear him, and his righteousness to children's children, to those who keep his covenant and remember to do his commandments. The Lord has established his throne in the heavens, and his kingdom rules over all.
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Romans 5:1-6</b> - Therefore, since we have been justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ. Through him we have also obtained access by faith into this grace in which we stand, and we rejoice in hope of the glory of God. More than that, we rejoice in our sufferings, knowing that suffering produces endurance, and endurance produces character, and character produces hope, and hope does not put us to shame, because God's love has been poured into our hearts through <b>the Holy Spirit</b> who has been given to us. For while we were still weak, at the right time Christ died for the ungodly.

<div id="outline-container-orgbfd504b" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="orgbfd504b"><span class="section-number-4">22.0.3.</span> However, we must submit to God's righteousness through faith in Jesus Christ - this is what saves</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-22-0-3">
<p>
It's not with the mind that a person believes, but with the heart:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Romans 10:6-13</b> - But the righteousness based on faith says, Do not say in your heart, Who will ascend into heaven? (that is, to bring Christ down) or Who will descend into the abyss? (that is, to bring Christ up from the dead).  But what does it say? The word is near you, in your mouth and in your heart (that is, the word of faith that we proclaim); because, if you confess with your mouth that Jesus is Lord and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved.  For <b>with the heart one believes (G4100 pisteuo) and is justified</b>, and with the mouth one confesses and is saved.  For the Scripture says, Everyone who believes in him will not be put to shame.  For there is no distinction between Jew and Greek; the same Lord is Lord of all, bestowing his riches on all who call on him.  For everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
But what does it take for the <span class="underline">heart</span> to truly believe? Because that's the condition. When the heart truly believes, a person is obedient.
</p>

<p>
More obedience may still need to take place for that individual to arrive at justifying faith, and God may be allowing you to come to your faith.
</p>

<p>
To be justified, a person must <span class="underline">walk in the footsteps of the faith that our father Abraham had before he was circumcised</span>.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Romans 4:9-12</b> - Is this blessing then only for the circumcised, or also for the uncircumcised? We say that faith was counted to Abraham as righteousness. How then was it counted to him? Was it before or after he had been circumcised? It was not after, but before he was circumcised. He received the sign of circumcision as a seal of the righteousness that he had by faith while he was still uncircumcised. The purpose was to make him the father of all who believe without being circumcised, so that righteousness would be counted to them as well, and to make him the father of the circumcised who are <span class="underline">not merely circumcised but who also walk in the footsteps of the faith that our father Abraham had before he was circumcised</span>.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
It does say '<b>you will be saved</b>', not '<b>you are saved</b>'.
</p>

<p>
And the word <b>confess</b> I think means to admit with repentance - an admission of guilt to God and change of mind resulting in confessing that Jesus is Lord and that God indeed raised Him from the dead, and that you needed Him to do so, because His name means Jesus (The LORD Saves), Christ (Annointed Messiah, Saviour), Son of God.
</p>

<p>
If a person confesses this truthfully, they professes that they submit to the righteousness of God.
</p>

<p>
That's a little bit loaded. It results in a heart growing in obedience towards God.
And I believe it's the resulting obedience to God that ends up saving that person, even if that obedience hasn't produced any work yet other than belief. God is the one that saves and justifies.
</p>

<p>
Then Jesus hits us with this:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>John 15:16</b> - You did not choose me, but I chose you and appointed you that you should go and bear fruit and that your fruit should abide, so that whatever you ask the Father in my name, he may give it to you.
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Ephesians 1:4</b> - even as he chose us in him before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy and blameless before him. In love
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
So while we might think we have done something, God had planned it in advance, and the entire thing is grace - but that doesn't mean from our perspective it does not look like we need to obey God - because we still need to have faith and do something. And if we don't do anything then we are asking God to do it for us.
</p>

<p>
Since the Bible does not teach that all people will be saved because they remain disobedient, I think we should teach people that they should do something; That they should repent from sin and they should repent from unbelief if they want to be saved from sin and leading to death, and if they want to enter into the light of the truth, and enter into a relationship with God.
</p>

<p>
The root of disobedience/rebellion is unbelief/denial.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>John 20:27-28</b> - Then he said to Thomas, Put your finger here, and see my hands; and put out your hand, and place it in my side. Do not disbelieve, but believe. Thomas answered him, My Lord and my God!
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Jesus helped Thomas believe by giving him a commandment to do. It's implied that Thomas obeyed and arrived at belief.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>John 20:29-31</b> - Jesus said to him, Have you believed because you have seen me? Blessed are those who have not seen and yet have believed.  Now Jesus did many other signs in the presence of the disciples, which are not written in this book; but these are written so that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that by believing you may have life in his name.

<p>
The righteousness we have through faith in Jesus Christ is needed whether someone keeps the Mosaic law or not.
</p>

<p>
Not that I keep the Mosaic law in its entirety, nor are circumcised. But I try to keep the Great commandments
and the 10 Commandments out of faith (and a relationship with God) and follow parts of the Mosaic law,
but I have faith in Jesus Christ for the righteousness that comes through faith because I need that because my own
righteousness will never be enough without faith in Jesus for God's righteousness imputed to me.
</p>

<p>
Thank You God.

And I follow pursue the commandments by faith and not works.

<p>
A person must be at least willing to do His will - obedience is the essence of faith:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>John 7:17</b> - If anyone is willing to do His will, he will know of the teaching, whether it is of God or whether I speak from Myself.
</p>

<p>
There is still obedience required. Obedience is intrinsic to faith.
</p>

<p>
This is why we are not <b>under</b> the law because we have the righteousness that comes through faith in Christ.
</p>

<p>
But we are under the law of faith in Christ.
</p>

<p>
And we are supposed to keep the commandments by pursuing them in faith.
</p>

<p>
If we teach others to annul even the least of the commandments and annul them ourselves, this I don't think condemn us but is prideful and result in being called the least in the Kingdom.

Faith eclipses the law:

<p>
I think someone who trusts in God to save them through saving faith in Jesus Christ, is saved, or is in the process of being saved.
But keep in mind that someone who truly trusts Jesus will do as Jesus has commanded.
</p>

<p>
Abraham's faith was both obedient and believing.
</p>

<p>
God is the judge of what saving faith looks like, and how long the process of 'being saved' takes.
</p>

<p>
We must receive Jesus' words, walk in them and come to <b>know in truth</b> (we must truly know) that Jesus came from God.

<p>
Therefore, we should obey Jesus and arrive at the truth. Obedience is a part of faith. Like Abraham obeying God, or like Israel crossing through the Red Sea, it's obedience which leads to sure belief.
And the obedience doesn't end.

<p>

I believe that a person needs to have an obedient heart - <span class="underline">wanting to do the will of Father God - wanting to obey Jesus Christ.</span>

<p>
Keeping Jesus Christ's commandments is a <span class="underline">requirement</span> to inherit eternal life, <span class="underline">not an extra</span>:

I think it's possible but you have to expect to receive it:

<p>
The repentant sinner next to Jesus on the cross knew he deserved his punishment, and he even demonstrated that he had a heart that obeys the gospel (whereas the other person appears to have been disobedient to the gospel to death):
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>John 7:17</b> - <span class="underline">If anyone's will is to do God's will</span>, he will know whether the teaching is from God or whether I am speaking on my own authority.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The unrepentant sinner wanted Jesus to save his present life:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Luke 23:39</b> - One of the criminals who were hanged there was hurling abuse at Him, saying, “Are You not the Christ? Save Yourself and us!”
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The repentant sinner feared God and put his hope on Jesus Christ, not to save him from the cross, but to save his soul:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Luke 23:40-43</b> - But the other answered, and rebuking him said, “Do you not even fear God, since you are under the same sentence of condemnation? And we indeed are suffering justly, for we are receiving what we deserve for our deeds; but this man has done nothing wrong.” And he was saying, “Jesus, remember me when You come in Your kingdom!” And He said to him, “Truly I say to you, today you shall be with Me in Paradise.”
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
A <span class="underline">key thing</span> here is that the repentant sinner didn't value his present life, and didn't care to ask Jesus to save his present life on earth. The repentant sinner had come to the end of caring about his present life, and put his trust in Jesus. This is what we should do, and it looks like sacrificing the present life to follow Jesus. And I believe that to someone who isn't literally at the end of their earthly life that looks like repentance from sin and an obedient heart, serving Jesus. You can see that he had a <span class="underline">changed heart</span>, and was remorseful. He knew he was being justly punished. And he had the heart to want to follow Jesus.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Luke 9:23-24</b> - And he said to all, If anyone would come after me, let him deny himself and take up his cross daily and follow me. For whoever would save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for my sake will save it. (ESV)

Saving faith with work (yes, obedience is intrinsic to faith, like belief):
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Matthew 14:28-31</b> - And Peter answered him, Lord, if it is you, command me to come to you on the water. He said, Come. So Peter got out of the boat and walked on the water and came to Jesus.

</blockquote>

<p>
Obeying Jesus' commandments - believing Jesus and acting on Jesus' commandments <b>is</b> faith.

<p>
Keeping <span class="underline">Jesus' deeds</span> is saving faith:

<blockquote>

<p>
James isn't talking about work of the law, he's talking about the works of faith.
</p>

<p>
God desires us to have mercy.
</p>

<p>
There are a lot of 'do nots' in the law but the most important thing is the 2 'do' commandments.
The 'do nots' are to stop people from doing bad things, but the 2 Greatest commandments command us to love God and our neighbour.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Matthew 22:37-40</b> - And he said to him, You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind. This is the great and first commandment. And a second is like it: You shall love your neighbor as yourself. On these two commandments depend all the Law and the Prophets.
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>James 2:13-17</b> - For judgment is without mercy to one who has shown no mercy. Mercy triumphs over judgment. What good is it, my brothers, if someone says he has faith but does not have works? Can that faith save him? If a brother or sister is poorly clothed and lacking in daily food, and one of you says to them, Go in peace, be warmed and filled, without giving them the things needed for the body, what good is that? So also faith by itself, if it does not have works, is dead.

<p>
MERCY.

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Matthew 12:3-8</b> - He said to them, Have you not read what David did when he was hungry, and those who were with him: how he entered the house of God and ate the bread of the Presence, which it was not lawful for him to eat nor for those who were with him, but only for the priests? Or have you not read in the Law how on the Sabbath the priests in the temple profane the Sabbath and are guiltless? I tell you, something greater than the temple is here. And <b>if you had known what this means, I desire mercy, and not sacrifice, you would not have condemned the guiltless.</b> For the Son of Man is lord of the Sabbath.

<p>
MERCY.

Faith without work is dead; it's useless.

That person is completely at the mercy of Jesus and of the saints, I think.

<li><a href="https://biblehub.com/interlinear/1_john/5-1.htm">1 John 5:1 Interlinear: Every one who is believing that Jesus is the Christ, of God he hath been begotten, and every one who is loving Him who did beget, doth love also him who is begotten of Him:</a></li>

<b>I John 5:1</b> - Everyone who believes that Jesus is the Christ has been born of God, and everyone who loves the Father loves whoever has been born of him. (ESV)

<p>
Therefore, we should receive Jesus' words and <span class="underline">obey</span> Jesus and <span class="underline">arrive</span> at the truth. Obedience is an essential part of faith. Like Abraham obeying God, or like Israel crossing through the Red Sea, it's obedience which <span class="underline">leads</span> to sure belief, and obedience that leads a person into sure knowledge of the truth, and obedience which cooperates with sanctification.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Exodus 14:14-16</b> - The Lord will fight for you, and you have only to be silent.  The Lord said to Moses, Why do you cry to me? Tell the people of Israel to go forward.  Lift up your staff, and stretch out your hand over the sea and divide it, that the people of Israel may go through the sea on dry ground.

<p>
Mercy is available:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Luke 18:13</b> - But the tax collector, standing far off, would not even lift up his eyes to heaven, but beat his breast, saying, God, be merciful to me, a sinner! (ESV)
</p>

<p>
Those who fear God inherit the Kingdom.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Matthew 5:3</b> - Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.

<p>
<b>Isaiah 66:2</b> - All these things my hand has made, and so all these things came to be, declares the LORD. But this is the one to whom I will look: he who is humble and contrite in spirit and trembles at my word. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
We need faithfulness and not faithlessness and disbelief to inherit the promises:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Hebrews 12:16-17</b> - that no one is sexually immoral or unholy like Esau, who sold his birthright for a single meal. For you know that afterward, when he desired to inherit the blessing, he was rejected, for he found no chance to repent, though he sought it with tears.
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Revelation of John 2:2</b> - I know your works, your toil and your patient endurance, and how you cannot bear with those who are evil, but have tested those who call themselves apostles and are not, and found them to be false.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Here it says that unless the church <b>does the work</b> which it had started out doing, their lampstand will be removed from its place.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Revelation of John 2:5</b> - Remember therefore from where you have fallen; repent, and do the works you did at first. If not, I will come to you and remove your lampstand from its place, unless you repent.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
A response of love for Jesus <b>is</b> justifying work.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Luke 7:47-50</b> - Therefore I tell you, her sins, which are many, are forgiven-for she loved much. But he who is forgiven little, loves little. And he said to her, Your sins are forgiven. Then those who were at table with him began to say among themselves, Who is this, who even forgives sins? And he said to the woman, Your faith has saved you; go in peace. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>James 2:22-25</b> - You see that faith was active along with his works, and faith was completed by his works; and the Scripture was fulfilled that says, Abraham believed God, and it was counted to him as righteousness-and he was called a friend of God. You see that a person is justified by works and not by faith alone. And in the same way was not also Rahab the prostitute justified by works when she received the messengers and sent them out by another way?
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
ONLY <b>working faith</b> counts for anything. Even Paul agrees. However, it says 'in Christ Jesus', and I believe that those who trust in Jesus without work still abide, but by the skin of their teeth.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Galatians 5:6</b> - For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision nor uncircumcision counts for anything, but <b>only faith working through love</b>. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Loving God is obeying His commandments.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>I John 5:2-3</b> - By this we know that we love the children of God, when we love God and obey his commandments. For this is the love of God, that we keep his commandments. And his commandments are not burdensome.

<p>
<b>II Timothy 2:24-26</b> - And the Lord's servant must not be quarrelsome but kind to everyone, able to teach, patiently enduring evil, correcting his opponents with gentleness.

<p>
Jesus is God's servant:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Acts 3:13</b> - The God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, the God of our fathers, glorified <b>his servant Jesus</b>, whom you delivered over and denied in the presence of Pilate, when he had decided to release him.

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Acts 4:24-30</b> - And when they heard it, they lifted their voices together to God and said, Sovereign Lord, who made the heaven and the earth and the sea and everything in them, who through the mouth of our father David, your servant, said by <b>the Holy Spirit</b>, Why did the Gentiles rage, and the peoples plot in vain?  The kings of the earth set themselves, and the rulers were gathered together, against the Lord and against his Anointed— for truly in this city there were gathered together against your <b>holy servant Jesus</b>, whom you anointed, both Herod and Pontius Pilate, along with the Gentiles and the peoples of Israel, to do whatever your hand and your plan had predestined to take place.  And now, Lord, look upon their threats and grant to your servants to continue to speak your word with all boldness, while you stretch out your hand to heal, and signs and wonders are performed through the name of your holy servant Jesus.

<p>
Jesus, as God's servant, came to serve others, and to save:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Mark 10:45</b> - For even the Son of Man came not to be served <b>but to serve</b>, and to give his life as a ransom for many.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Because God loves people, and wants them to be saved:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>John 3:16</b> - For God so loved the world, that he gave his only Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
God loves and sees as a son those who love (by obedience) Jesus and believe that He came from God:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>John 16:26-27</b> - In that day you will ask in my name, and I do not say to you that I will ask the Father on your behalf; for the Father himself loves you, because you have loved me and have believed that I came from God.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
We are Jesus' servants:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>John 18:36</b> - Jesus answered, My kingdom is not of this world. If my kingdom were of this world, <b>my servants</b> would have been fighting, that I might not be delivered over to the Jews. But my kingdom is not from the world.

</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
For Jesus' sake we serve others:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>II Corinthians 4:5</b> - For what we proclaim is not ourselves, but Jesus Christ as Lord, with ourselves as your servants for Jesus' sake.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
A good servant of Jesus is trained in the words of the faith and of the good doctrine.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>I Timothy 4:6</b> - If you put these things before the brothers, you will be a good <b>servant of Christ Jesus</b>, being trained in the words of the faith and of the good doctrine that you have followed.

God saved us through Jesus:

<p>
Servants of Jesus Christ are servants of God. Servants of God are servants of Jesus Christ:

</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>I Corinthians 4:1</b> - This is how one should regard us, as servants of Christ and stewards of the mysteries of God.

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Jude 1:1</b> - Jude, a servant of Jesus Christ and brother of James, To those who are called, beloved in God the Father and kept for Jesus Christ:
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The Revelation of John is for God's servants:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Revelation of John 1:1</b> - The revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave him to show to his servants the things that must soon take place. He made it known by sending his angel to his servant John,
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
If anyone's will is to be a servant of God, they will receive revelation which confirms the scriptures:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>John 7:17</b> - If anyone's will is to do God's will, he will know whether the teaching is from God or whether I am speaking on my own authority.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
God's angels are servants:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Revelation of John 19:10</b> - Then I fell down at his feet to worship him, but he said to me, You must not do that! I am a fellow servant with you and your brothers who hold to the testimony of Jesus. Worship God. For the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The world cannot hate people who are disobedient to God:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>John 7:5-7</b> - For not even his brothers believed in him. Jesus said to them, My time has not yet come, but your time is always here. The world cannot hate you, but it hates me because I testify about it that its works are evil.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
But the servant of Christ is to be a light to the world:
</p>

<p>
The world (the remaining people, who have not repented) may know that Father God has sent Jesus and loved Jesus' disciples:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>John 17:23</b> - I in them and you in me, that they may become perfectly one, <span class="underline">so that the world may know that you sent me and loved them even as you loved me.</span>

</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Ephesians 2:2</b> - in which you once walked, following the course of this world, following the prince of the power of the air, the spirit that is now at work in the sons of disobedience—

<p>
Servants of Jesus who are servants of God encounter resistance from the world:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>I John 2:15</b> - Do not love the world or the things in the world. If anyone loves the world, the love of the Father is not in him.

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>John 12:25</b> -  Whoever loves his life loses it, and whoever hates his life in this world will keep it for eternal life.  (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Matthew 6:30-32</b> - But if God so clothes the grass of the field, which today is alive and tomorrow is thrown into the oven, will he not much more clothe you, O you of little faith? Therefore do not be anxious, saying, What shall we eat? or What shall we drink? or What shall we wear? For the Gentiles seek after all these things, and your heavenly Father knows that you need them all.
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>John 15:18-19</b> - If the world hates you, know that it has hated me before it hated you. If you were of the world, the world would love you as its own; but because you are not of the world, but I chose you out of the world, therefore the world hates you.

<p>
<b>John 15:23</b> - Whoever hates me hates my Father also.

<p>
<b>II Corinthians 11:23</b> - Are they servants of Christ? I am a better one—I am talking like a madman—with far greater labors, far more imprisonments, with countless beatings, and often near death.

<p>
Pleasing man is loving the world:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Galatians 1:10</b> - For am I now seeking the approval of man, or of God? Or am I trying to please man? If I were still trying to please man, I would not be a servant of Christ.

<p>
<b>Ephesians 6:6</b> - not by the way of eye-service, as people-pleasers, but as <span class="underline">servants of Christ, doing the will of God</span> <b>from the heart</b>,
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
As servants of Jesus, we should encourage other servants of Jesus to maturity:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Colossians 4:12</b> - Epaphras, who is one of you, a servant of Christ Jesus, greets you, always struggling on your behalf in his prayers, that you may stand mature and fully assured in all the will of God.
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Colossians 1:7</b> - just as you learned it from Epaphras our beloved fellow servant. He is a faithful minister of Christ on your behalf

</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Hebrews 10:36-39</b> - For you have need of endurance, so that when you have done the will of God you may receive what is promised. For, Yet a little while, and the coming one will come and will not delay; but my righteous one shall live by faith, and if he shrinks back, my soul has no pleasure in him. But we are not of those who shrink back and are destroyed, but of those who have faith and preserve their souls.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
A disciple of Jesus is a servant of Jesus:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>John 8:31</b> - So Jesus said to the Jews who had believed in him, If you abide in my word, you are truly my disciples, (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
It requires letting go of this world:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>II Timothy 4:10</b> - For Demas, in love with this present world, has deserted me and gone to Thessalonica. Crescens has gone to Galatia, Titus to Dalmatia. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Matthew 19:22-23</b> - When the young man heard this he went away sorrowful, for he had great possessions. And Jesus said to his disciples, Truly, I say to you, only with difficulty will a rich person enter the kingdom of heaven. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Repentance is important:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Matthew 3:3-9</b> - For this is he who was spoken of by the prophet Isaiah when he said, The voice of one crying in the wilderness: Prepare the way of the Lord; make his paths straight. Now John wore a garment of camel's hair and a leather belt around his waist, and his food was locusts and wild honey. Then Jerusalem and all Judea and all the region about the Jordan were going out to him, and they were baptized by him in the river Jordan, confessing their sins. But when he saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees coming for baptism, he said to them, You brood of vipers! Who warned you to flee from the wrath to come? Bear fruit in keeping with repentance. And do not presume to say to yourselves, We have Abraham as our father, for I tell you, God is able from these stones to raise up children for Abraham.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Jesus will gather His <span class="underline">wheat</span> into the barn:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Matthew 3:10-12</b> - Even now the axe is laid to the root of the trees. Every tree therefore that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire. I baptize you with water for repentance, but he who is coming after me is mightier than I, whose sandals I am not worthy to carry. He will baptize you with <b>the Holy Spirit</b> and with fire. His winnowing fork is in his hand, and he will clear his threshing floor and gather his wheat into the barn, but the chaff he will burn with unquenchable fire.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
We should become followers of Jesus.
</p>

<p>
Justice, mercy and faithfulness are <b>essential</b> for entering the Kingdom of God.
</p>

<p>
Repentance and holiness are <span class="underline">very important</span> for entering the Kingdom of God too.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Matthew 23:23-25</b> - Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you tithe mint and dill and cumin, and have neglected the weightier matters of the law: <span class="underline">justice and mercy and faithfulness. These you ought to have done, without neglecting the others</span>. You blind guides, straining out a gnat and swallowing a camel! Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you clean the outside of the cup and the plate, but inside they are full of greed and self-indulgence.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
We must turn from sin and lead godly lives with faith in Jesus:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Matthew 5:14-20</b> - You are the light of the world. A city set on a hill cannot be hidden. Nor do people light a lamp and put it under a basket, but on a stand, and it gives light to all in the house. In the same way, let your light shine before others, so that they may see your good works and give glory to your Father who is in heaven. Do not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them. For truly, I say to you, until heaven and earth pass away, not an iota, not a dot, will pass from the Law until all is accomplished. Therefore whoever relaxes one of the least of these commandments and teaches others to do the same will be called least in the kingdom of heaven, but whoever does them and teaches them will be called great in the kingdom of heaven. For I tell you, <span class="underline">unless your righteousness exceeds that of the scribes and Pharisees, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven</span>.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Believing John the Baptist is in accordance with believing Jesus:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Matthew 21:28-32</b> - What do you think? A man had two sons. And he went to the first and said, Son, go and work in the vineyard today. And he answered, I will not, but afterward he changed his mind and went. And he went to the other son and said the same. And he answered, I go, sir, but did not go. Which of the two did the will of his father? They said, The first. Jesus said to them, Truly, I say to you, the tax collectors and the prostitutes go into the kingdom of God before you. For John came to you in the way of righteousness, and you did not believe him, but the tax collectors and the prostitutes believed him. And even when you saw it, you did not afterward change your minds and believe him.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The works of the law are not essential for being justified by God, but faith in Jesus is, and I believe that following Jesus is in accordance with having faith in Jesus:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Galatians 2:16</b> - yet we know that a person is not justified by works of the law but through faith in Jesus Christ, so we also have believed in Christ Jesus, in order to be justified by faith in Christ and not by works of the law, because by works of the law no one will be justified.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Nevertheless, following the commandments and repenting from sin are of great value, I think.
</p>

<p>
But through faith in Christ Jesus we are justified and have peace with God.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Galatians 3:24-26</b> - So then, the law was our guardian until Christ came, in order that we might be justified by faith. But now that faith has come, we are no longer under a guardian, for in Christ Jesus you are all sons of God, through faith.

<p>
According to <code>Matthew 19</code>, obeying (actually keeping, complying with) the commandments (10 commandments, <b>from the heart</b>, and in reality, accountable to God / the 2 Great commandments) is important for entering into the Kingdom of Heaven [well], entering into life [well]:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Matthew 19:16-26</b> - And behold, a man came up to him, saying, Teacher, what good deed must I do to have eternal life? And he said to him, Why do you ask me about what is good? There is only one who is good. If you would enter life, keep the commandments. He said to him, Which ones? And Jesus said, You shall not murder, You shall not commit adultery, You shall not steal, You shall not bear false witness, Honor your father and mother, and, You shall love your neighbor as yourself. The young man said to him, All these I have kept. What do I still lack? Jesus said to him, If you would be perfect, go, sell what you possess and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; and come, follow me. When the young man heard this he went away sorrowful, for he had great possessions. And Jesus said to his disciples, Truly, I say to you, only with difficulty will a rich person enter the kingdom of heaven. Again I tell you, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich person to enter the kingdom of God. When the disciples heard this, they were greatly astonished, saying, Who then can be saved? But Jesus looked at them and said, With man this is impossible, but with God all things are possible.
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>II Corinthians 11:31</b> - The God and Father of the Lord Jesus, he who is blessed forever, knows that I am not lying.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Apply them in truth - keep accountability to God, not merely to other people. God can see.
</p>

<p>
Also, lay up treasure in Heaven:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Matthew 19:21</b> - Jesus said to him, If you would be perfect, go, sell what you possess and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; and come, follow me.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Also, <span class="underline">most importantly</span> believe in the atonement which Jesus provides:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>John 6:55-71</b> - For my flesh is true food, and my blood is true drink. Whoever feeds on my flesh and drinks my blood abides in me, and I in him. As the living Father sent me, and I live because of the Father, so whoever feeds on me, he also will live because of me. This is the bread that came down from heaven, not as the fathers ate and died. Whoever feeds on this bread will live forever. Jesus said these things in the synagogue, as he taught at Capernaum. When many of his disciples heard it, they said, This is a hard saying; who can listen to it? But Jesus, knowing in himself that his disciples were grumbling about this, said to them, Do you take offense at this? Then what if you were to see the Son of Man ascending to where he was before? It is the Spirit who gives life; the flesh is of no avail. The words that I have spoken to you are spirit and life. But there are some of you who do not believe. (For Jesus knew from the beginning who those were who did not believe, and who it was who would betray him. )
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Both free grace and Lordship are required.
</p>

<p>
If either the atonement is rejected or Jesus' Lordship is rejected, I think both groups of people who have rejected atonement or Lordship will be rejected.
And I define Lordship as obeying Jesus Christ, and I define obeying Jesus Christ as obeying His commandments; not just sharing the gospel but also His commandment to love others in the same way that He has loved us.
However, if someone hasn't heard the good news yet, but lives righteously then God will judge that person fairly, I think.
</p>

<p>
Also, <span class="underline">most importantly,</span> become obedient to Jesus:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Obey Jesus' commandments</li>
<li>Do not follow the pattern of this world; leave this world behind</li>
<li>Become a servant of Jesus</li>
<li>We must forgive others</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>

<b>Matthew 10:24</b> - A disciple is not above his teacher, nor a servant above his master.

<b>John 6:63-69</b> - It is the Spirit who gives life; the flesh is of no avail. The words that I have spoken to you are spirit and life. But there are some of you who do not believe. (For Jesus knew from the beginning who those were who did not believe, and who it was who would betray him. ) And he said, This is why I told you that no one can come to me unless it is granted him by the Father. After this many of his disciples turned back and no longer walked with him. So Jesus said to the Twelve, Do you want to go away as well? Simon Peter answered him, Lord, to whom shall we go? You have the words of eternal life, and we have believed, and have come to know, that you are the Holy One of God.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Most importantly, don't betray Jesus:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>John 6:70-71</b> - Jesus answered them, Did I not choose you, the Twelve? And yet one of you is a devil. He spoke of Judas the son of Simon Iscariot, for he, one of the Twelve, was going to betray him.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Obey the law (to your knowledge or level of commitment) in faith, not by works, making yourself accountable to God, not men, and accept the righteousness of God through Jesus Christ's atoning sacrifice through having faith in Jesus:
</p>

<p>
We need to be justified before God, and that is through faith in Jesus Christ.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Luke 16:15-17</b> - And he said to them, You are those who justify yourselves before men, but God knows your hearts. For what is exalted among men is an abomination in the sight of God.  The Law and the Prophets were until John; since then the good news of the kingdom of God is preached, and everyone forces his way into it. But it is easier for heaven and earth to pass away than for one dot of the Law to become void.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Do the will of Father God.
</p>

<p>
To do the will of Father God, one must do it in truth - God knows and can see the heart.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>II Corinthians 11:31</b> - The God and Father of the Lord Jesus, he who is blessed forever, knows that I am not lying.
</p>

<p>
Don't be a ravenous wolf on the inside (repent from sin)!
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Matthew 7:14-23</b> - For the gate is narrow and the way is hard that leads to life, and those who find it are few.  Beware of false prophets, who come to you in sheep's clothing but inwardly are ravenous wolves.  You will recognize them by their fruits. Are grapes gathered from thornbushes, or figs from thistles?  So, every healthy tree bears good fruit, but the diseased tree bears bad fruit.  A healthy tree cannot bear bad fruit, nor can a diseased tree bear good fruit.  Every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.  Thus you will recognize them by their fruits.  Not everyone who says to me, Lord, Lord, will enter the kingdom of heaven, but the one who does the will of my Father who is in heaven.  On that day many will say to me, Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in your name, and cast out demons in your name, and do many mighty works in your name?  And then will I declare to them, I never knew you; depart from me, you workers of lawlessness.

<p>
We must throw out the old and allow God to build the new house/life for us.
We must cooperate with God by doing what Jesus has instructed, and not fighting against Jesus' commandments.

God and Abram (Abraham) had a real relationship first.
</p>

<p>
God spoke to Abram first, and then Abram <b>obeyed</b>.
Abraham was faithful.
God noticed Abram's faithfulness, and told Abram he would be rewarded.
God gave Abram a promise.
Abram believed God.
</p>

<p>
But God made the first move.
The first move from Abraham's perspective was obedience, followed by belief.
</p>

<p>
The Lord God spoke first - this itself is a gift. We have the Bible and the testimony of others as a gift from God.
We must then believe what is said in the Holy Scriptures and trust it and obey it (put into practice).
</p>

<p>
The Holy Spirit goes to those who obey God, and causes the person to walk in God's precepts - stopping lying, stealing, coveting, idolizing, cheating, etc.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Acts 5:32</b> - And we are witnesses to these things, and so is <b>he Holy Spirit</b>, whom God has given <span class="underline">to those who obey him</span>. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Faith involves:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Obedience</li>
<li>Loyalty (faithfulness to God)</li>
<li>God rewarded Abram with a promise</li>
<li>Abram believed God</li>
<li>God counted Abram's belief as righteousness</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Genesis 12:1</b> - Now the Lord said to Abram, Go from your country and your kindred and your father's house to the land that I will show you.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Abraham <b>obeyed</b> God.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Genesis 12:4</b> - So Abram went, as the Lord had told him, and Lot went with him. Abram was seventy-five years old when he departed from Haran.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
God promised him something, and gave Abram an instruction.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Genesis 13:14</b> - The Lord said to Abram, after Lot had separated from him, Lift up your eyes and look from the place where you are, northward and southward and eastward and westward, for all the land that you see I will give to you and to your offspring forever. I will make your offspring as the dust of the earth, so that if one can count the dust of the earth, your offspring also can be counted. Arise, walk through the length and the breadth of the land, for I will give it to you.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Abram obeyed.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Genesis 13:18</b> - So Abram moved his tent and came and settled by the oaks of Mamre, which are at Hebron, and there he built an altar to the Lord.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
OBEDIENCE!
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Hebrews 5:9-10</b> - And being made perfect, he became the source of eternal salvation to all who <b>obey</b> him, being designated by God a high priest after the order of Melchizedek.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Abram interacted with Melchizedek, priest of God Most High, blessed by God Most High. Abram was faithful to God even when God wasn't speaking directly to Him. God can see everything though.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Genesis 14:18-20</b> - And Melchizedek king of Salem brought out bread and wine. (He was priest of God Most High. ) And he blessed him and said, Blessed be Abram by God Most High, Possessor of heaven and earth; and blessed be God Most High, who has delivered your enemies into your hand! And Abram gave him a tenth of everything.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Abram, in an act of faith with faithfulness, displayed loyalty to God. Abram wanted to prove it will be God who has empowered future blessing which Abram has faith about.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Genesis 14:21-24</b> - And the king of Sodom said to Abram, Give me the persons, but take the goods for yourself. But Abram said to the king of Sodom, I have lifted my hand to the Lord, God Most High, Possessor of heaven and earth, that I would not take a thread or a sandal strap or anything that is yours, lest you should say, I have made Abram rich. I will take nothing but what the young men have eaten, and the share of the men who went with me. Let Aner, Eshcol, and Mamre take their share.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
God noticed and gave Abram a vision and made a promise to Abram, and Abram believed God and God counted it to Abram as righteousness.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Genesis 15:1</b> - After these things the word of the Lord came to Abram in a vision: Fear not, Abram, I am your shield; your reward shall be very great. But Abram said, O Lord God, what will you give me, for I continue childless, and the heir of my house is Eliezer of Damascus? And Abram said, Behold, you have given me no offspring, and a member of my household will be my heir. And behold, the word of the Lord came to him: This man shall not be your heir; your very own son shall be your heir. And he brought him outside and said, Look toward heaven, and number the stars, if you are able to number them. Then he said to him, So shall your offspring be. And he believed the Lord, and he counted it to him as righteousness.

<p>
<b>James 2:22-25</b> - You see that faith was active along with his works, and faith was completed by his works; and the Scripture was fulfilled that says, Abraham believed God, and it was counted to him as righteousness-and he was called a friend of God.

And in the same way was not also Rahab the prostitute justified by works when she received the messengers and sent them out by another way?
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
A person, I think, can be justified by faith that includes obedient action.
</p>

<p>
Even continued belief in the form of patient endurance is a work, I think!
</p>

<p>
I believe justification is God's prerogative, and He justifies because of our faith in Jesus, not because of any dead work we offer Him. I just believe that faith in Jesus may include obedient action.
Actually, I believe that even believing in Jesus is obedience, because Jesus commanded it.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Romans 5:1</b> - Therefore, since we have been justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ.
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Galatians 2:16</b> - yet we know that a person is not justified by works of the law but through faith in Jesus Christ, so we also have believed in Christ Jesus, in order to be justified by faith in Christ and not by works of the law, because by works of the law no one will be justified.
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Galatians 3:24-26</b> - So then, the law was our guardian until Christ came, in order that we might be justified by faith. But now that faith has come, we are no longer under a guardian, for in Christ Jesus you are all sons of God, through faith.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
But I think God can save a person who has belief without work because God is sovereign to save in this way.
</p>

<p>
Anyway, see Revelation and you will see Jesus points out different works for different churches.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Revelation of John 2:2</b> - I know your works, your toil and your patient endurance, and how you cannot bear with those who are evil, but have tested those who call themselves apostles and are not, and found them to be false.
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Revelation of John 2:5</b> - Remember therefore from where you have fallen; repent, and do the works you did at first. If not, I will come to you and remove your lampstand from its place, unless you repent.
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Revelation of John 2:6</b> - Yet this you have: you hate the works of the Nicolaitans, which I also hate.
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Revelation of John 2:19</b> - I know your works, your love and faith and service and patient endurance, and that your latter works exceed the first.
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Revelation of John 2:22-23</b> - Behold, I will throw her onto a sickbed, and those who commit adultery with her I will throw into great tribulation, unless they repent of her works, and I will strike her children dead. And all the churches will know that I am he who searches mind and heart, and <b>I will give to each of you as your works deserve</b>.
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Revelation of John 3:1-2</b> - And to the angel of the church in Sardis write: The words of him who has the seven spirits of God and the seven stars. I know your works. You have the reputation of being alive, but you are dead. Wake up, and strengthen what remains and is about to die, for I have not found your works complete in the sight of my God.

<blockquote>

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-29-2-2">
<p>
To be justified, a person must <span class="underline">walk in the footsteps of the faith that our father Abraham had before he was circumcised</span>.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Romans 4:9-12</b> - Is this blessing then only for the circumcised, or also for the uncircumcised? We say that faith was counted to Abraham as righteousness. How then was it counted to him? Was it before or after he had been circumcised? It was not after, but before he was circumcised. He received the sign of circumcision as a seal of the righteousness that he had by faith while he was still uncircumcised. The purpose was to make him the father of all who believe without being circumcised, so that righteousness would be counted to them as well, and to make him the father of the circumcised who are <span class="underline">not merely circumcised but who also walk in the footsteps of the faith that our father Abraham had before he was circumcised</span>.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Salvation is received by faith - which necessitates an obedient heart:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Romans 3:25</b> - whom God put forward as a propitiation by his blood, to be received by faith. This was to show God's righteousness, because in his divine forbearance he had passed over former sins.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Faith receives - believing in Him is <span class="underline">having faith</span> in Him - trusting Him:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Acts 10:41-44</b> - not to all the people but to us who had been chosen by God as witnesses, who ate and drank with him after he rose from the dead. And he commanded us to preach to the people and to testify that he is the one appointed by God to be judge of the living and the dead. To him all the prophets bear witness that everyone who believes in him receives forgiveness of sins through his name. While Peter was still saying these things, <b>the Holy Spirit</b> fell on all who heard the word. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Although a gift, salvation must be asked for and sought after:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Luke 11:9-13</b> - And I tell you, <b>ask, and it will be given</b> to you; <b>seek, and you will find</b>; <b>knock, and it will be opened</b> to you.  For <b>everyone who asks receives</b>, and <b>the one who seeks finds</b>, and to <b>the one who knocks it will be opened</b>.  What father among you, if his son asks for a fish, will instead of a fish give him a serpent; or if he asks for an egg, will give him a scorpion?  If you then, who are evil, know how to give <b>good gifts</b> to your children, how much more will the heavenly Father give <b>the Holy Spirit</b> to those who ask him!
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
<i><b>Obeying God.</b></i>
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Hebrews 11:8</b> - By faith Abraham obeyed when he was called to go out to a place that he was to receive as an inheritance. And he went out, not knowing where he was going.

<b>Genesis 12:1-3</b> - Now the LORD said to Abram, Go from your country and your kindred and your father's house to the land that I will show you.

I will bless those who bless you, and him who dishonors you I will curse, and in you all the families of the earth shall be blessed. (ESV)

<p>
<i><b>Believing God.</b></i>
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Genesis 15:1</b> - After these things the word of the Lord came to Abram in a vision: Fear not, Abram, I am your shield; your reward shall be very great. But Abram said, O Lord God, what will you give me, for I continue childless, and the heir of my house is Eliezer of Damascus?

<p>
<i><b>Conviction.</b></i>
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Hebrews 11:17-19</b> - By faith Abraham, when he was tested, offered up Isaac, and he who had received the promises was in the act of offering up his only son, of whom it was said, Through Isaac shall your offspring be named. He considered that God was able even to raise him from the dead, from which, figuratively speaking, he did receive him back.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Like Abraham, a believer's faith may be tested.
</p>

<p>
<i><b>Trust in God.</b></i>,
</p>

<p>
<i><b>Fear of God.</b></i>,
</p>

<p>
<i><b>Testable faith.</b></i>
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Genesis 22:9-14</b> - When they came to the place of which God had told him, Abraham built the altar there and laid the wood in order and bound Isaac his son and laid him on the altar, on top of the wood. Then Abraham reached out his hand and took the knife to slaughter his son. But the angel of the Lord called to him from heaven and said, Abraham, Abraham! And he said, Here am I. He said, Do not lay your hand on the boy or do anything to him, for now I know that you fear God, seeing you have not withheld your son, your only son, from me. And Abraham lifted up his eyes and looked, and behold, behind him was a ram, caught in a thicket by his horns. And Abraham went and took the ram and offered it up as a burnt offering instead of his son. So Abraham called the name of that place, The Lord will provide; as it is said to this day, On the mount of the Lord it shall be provided.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
<i><b>Holding onto the promise, even to death if required.</b></i>
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Hebrews 11:13</b> - These all died in faith, not having received the things promised, but having seen them and greeted them from afar, and having acknowledged that they were strangers and exiles on the earth.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Like Abraham, a believer keeps the faith right to the end of their life or until Jesus takes them home.
</p>

<p>
<i><b>Patient endurance / waiting on God (belief * time).</b></i>
</p>

<p>
We should have <b>busy</b> (non-sluggish) faith,
and imitate the faith of people such as
Abraham, so that we inherit the promises.
We can believe those promises which we inherit.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Hebrews 6:12-15</b> - so that you may not be sluggish, but imitators of those who through faith and patience inherit the promises. For when God made a promise to Abraham, since he had no one greater by whom to swear, he swore by himself, saying, Surely I will bless you and multiply you. And thus Abraham, having patiently waited, obtained the promise.

<p>
To follow the law by faith, I think, is to not lie, commit adultery, idolize, etc. in truth and reality, keeping yourself accountable to God.

This is the key, I think, to following the law by faith: <b>praise from God and not men</b>.

Faith eclipses the law:

<p>
<b>Romans 4:9-12</b> - Is this blessing then only for the circumcised, or also for the uncircumcised? We say that faith was counted to Abraham as righteousness. How then was it counted to him? Was it before or after he had been circumcised? It was not after, but before he was circumcised. He received the sign of circumcision as a seal of the righteousness that he had by faith while he was still uncircumcised. The purpose was to make him the father of all who believe without being circumcised, so that righteousness would be counted to them as well, and to make him the father of the circumcised who are <span class="underline">not merely circumcised but who also walk in the footsteps of the faith that our father Abraham had before he was circumcised</span>.
</p>

<p>
The ones under the law who also walk in the footsteps of the faith that Abraham had before he was circumcised, come under the umbrella of the faith of Abraham, which the Gentiles who also share the faith of Abraham are included within.

So then, those who are of faith are blessed along with Abraham, the man of faith.  (ESV)

<p>
We can start by believing what God told us through Jesus:

<p>
The most important thing though is faith because it applies to both the adherent of the law and also the Gentile who has faith.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-29-8">
<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Acts 10:43:</b> Of Him all <b>the prophets bear witness</b> that <b>through His name</b> everyone who believes in Him receives forgiveness of sins."
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
But before and/or after believing and being forgiven a person needs to also turn away from sin.
To be '<b>saved</b>' I think means:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>for God to forgive one's sins through Jesus Christ, and</li>
<li>for that person to be progressing towards holiness and not away from holiness - towards sanctification and ultimately, eternal life
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><b>the Holy Spirit</b> helps a person to do that</li>
</ul></li>
<li>to be eagerly waiting for Jesus to save them</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Hebrews 9:27-28</b> - And just as it is appointed for man to die once, and after that comes judgment, so Christ, having been offered once to bear the sins of many, will appear a second time, not to deal with sin but <b>to save those who are eagerly waiting for him</b>.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Becoming a slave of God, rather than sin, the fruit you get leads to sanctification and at the end, eternal life - it leads to knowing the only true God, and Jesus Christ who He sent.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Romans 6:16-22</b> - Do you not know that if you present yourselves to anyone as obedient slaves, you are slaves of the one whom you obey, either of sin, which leads to death, or of obedience, which leads to righteousness? But thanks be to God, that you who were once slaves of sin have become obedient <b>from the heart</b> to the standard of teaching to which you were committed, and, having been set free from sin, have become slaves of righteousness. I am speaking in human terms, because of your natural limitations. For just as you once presented your members as slaves to impurity and to lawlessness leading to more lawlessness, so now present your members as slaves to righteousness leading to sanctification. When you were slaves of sin, you were free in regard to righteousness. But what fruit were you getting at that time from the things of which you are now ashamed? The end of those things is death. But now that you have been set free from sin and have become slaves of God, the fruit you get leads to sanctification and its end, <b>eternal life</b>. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
So obedience leads to sanctification which leads to eternal life which is knowing God and Jesus Christ.
</p>

<p>
Repentance from sin is required step for those who are in sin, along with forgiveness, and is followed up with sanctification and eternal life.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Luke 15:7</b> - Just so, I tell you, there will be more joy in heaven over one sinner who repents than over ninety-nine righteous persons who need no repentance. (ESV)

<blockquote>
<p>
I do not actually know what 'astral projection is'. I just googled for whatever I could find to describe it.
</p>

<p>
This was something for sure, it was a conversation in my sleep, accompanied by dreams.
</p>

<p>
The first incident was a blue 'light body' which I have felt up until this day, and after that, I have felt like the 'veil' has been very thin
and I have had spiritual experiences, and noticing things spiritually.
</p>

<p>
This was not brought on by meditation or anything, but it happened 'to' me.
</p>

<p>
I prayed to God consecrating this part of my life to Jesus and the Holy Spirit.
</p>

<p>
And I also prayed that I would not have any out of body experiences like this.

<p>
Since Faith is proportional to Love for God, which is proportional to obeying God, the following can be understood.

<p>
A person with true faith in God walks into the truth because true faith has eyes fixed on Jesus and goes to Jesus as it obeys the will of God.

</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
I think faith is like casting a net to receive something.
</p>

<p>
If you want to catch something big then you need a lot of faith.
</p>

<p>
Faith receives salvation, and salvation is the gift which is received through faith.
Faith is something which a person must have to receive the free gift.
The onus is on us to receive the free gift.
</p>

<p>
We must approach Jesus.
We must repent (change our minds, turning from our wicked ways, and turn to God) and obey God.
God has said many things, about his statutes and about how we should listen to Jesus.
I think repentance (<b>from the heart</b> turning from sin) is still approaching Jesus because Jesus fulfilled the law.
</p>

<p>
Humble yourself and obey God's commandments (not out of pride, but out of authentic faith with God, being accountable to God, in secret).
</p>

<p>
For example, abstaining from partaking in stealing, or adultery and being faithful to God, even if you lose friends over it.
This type of obeying God's commandments is nothing to do with pride or self-exultation or self-righteousness and everything to do with being faithful to God and humbling oneself to God.
</p>

<p>
Trying to turn from sin in truth and reality.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>2 Chronicles 7:14</b> - if my people who are called by my name humble themselves, and pray and seek my face and turn from their wicked ways, then I will hear from heaven and will forgive their sin and heal their land. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Matthew 18:3</b> - and said, Truly, I say to you, unless you turn and become like children, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
It says unless <b>you</b> turn - The onus is on you.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Matthew 5:20</b> - For I tell you, unless your righteousness exceeds that of the scribes and Pharisees, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
It says unless <b>your</b> righteousness.
</p>

<p>
Faith in Jesus probably qualifies a person to 'enter' the Kingdom of Heaven.
Also, following the law by faith in truth I think qualifies a person to enter the Kingdom of Heaven.
Also the Kingdom of Heaven, I think is from Heaven to Earth.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>II Corinthians 5:21</b> - For our sake he made him to be sin who knew no sin, so that in him we might become the righteousness of God.
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Titus 3:7</b> - so that being justified by his grace we might become heirs according to the hope of eternal life.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
<i><b>Through faith a person is saved (the onus is on us to receive)</b></i>
</p>

<p>
Salvation is the gift. Works can be dead works when they're not done in faith. Therefore works don't save.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Ephesians 2:8-9</b> - For <b>by grace you have been saved through faith.</b> And this is not your own doing; it is the gift of God, not a result of works, so that no one may boast. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
A person must be at least willing to do His will - obedience is the essence of faith:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>John 7:17</b> - If anyone is willing to do His will, he will know of the teaching, whether it is of God or whether I speak from Myself.
</p>

</ul>

<p>
<b>Revelation of John 2:19</b> - I know your works, your love and faith and service and patient endurance, and that your latter works exceed the first.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Abraham's obedience is a work of faith.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Hebrews 11:8</b> - By faith Abraham obeyed when he was called to go out to a place that he was to receive as an inheritance. And he went out, not knowing where he was going. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Hebrews 11:6</b> - And without faith it is impossible to please him, for whoever would draw near to God <b>must believe that he exists and that he rewards those who seek him.</b> (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Work substantiates faith because it is the act of receiving from God.
</p>

<p>
A work of faith could indeed be following the law in faith (as opposed to following the law by works).
</p>

<p>
For example, keeping your integrity, remaining faithful to God and not lying to God.
</p>

<p>
Patient endurance is a 'work of faith'.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Revelation of John 3:8</b> - I know your <b>works</b>. Behold, I have set before you an open door, which no one is able to shut. I know that you have but little power, and yet you have <b>kept my word and have not denied my name</b>.

<p>
I think that choosing a relationship Biblically is contrary to worldly precepts:

That's how I interpret how the following passage says that the Kingdom of God is not coming with signs to be observed:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Luke 17:20-21</b> - Being asked by the Pharisees when the kingdom of God would come, he answered them, The kingdom of God is not coming with signs to be observed, nor will they say, Look, here it is! or There! for behold, the <span class="underline">kingdom of God is in the midst of you.</span>

And he was seeking to see who Jesus was, but on account of the crowd he could not, because he was small of stature. So he ran on ahead and climbed up into a sycamore tree to see him, for he was about to pass that way. And when Jesus came to the place, he looked up and said to him, Zacchaeus, hurry and come down, for I must stay at your house today. So he hurried and came down and received him joyfully. And when they saw it, they all grumbled, He has gone in to be the guest of a man who is a sinner. And Zacchaeus stood and said to the Lord, Behold, Lord, the half of my goods I give to the poor. And if I have defrauded anyone of anything, I restore it fourfold. And Jesus said to him, <span class="underline">Today salvation has come to this house, since he also is a son of Abraham.

Do you not know that all of us who have been baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into his death? We were buried therefore with him by baptism into death, in order that, just as Christ was raised from the dead by the glory of the Father, we too might walk in newness of life. For <b>if we have been united with him in a death like his, we shall certainly be united with him in a resurrection like his</b>. We know that our old self was crucified with him in order that the body of sin might be brought to nothing, so that we would no longer be enslaved to sin. For one who has died has been set free from sin. Now if we have died with Christ, we believe that we will also live with him. We know that Christ being raised from the dead will never die again; death no longer has dominion over him.

Do not present your members to sin as instruments for unrighteousness, but present yourselves to God as those who have been brought from death to life, and your members to God as instruments for righteousness. For sin will have no dominion over you, since you are not under law but under grace. What then? Are we to sin because we are not under law but under grace? By no means! Do you not know that if you present yourselves to anyone as obedient slaves, you are slaves of the one whom you obey, either of sin, which leads to death, or of <b>obedience, which leads to righteousness?</b>
</p>

<p>
We must be slaves to righteousness, which leads to our sanctification:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Romans 6:17-21</b> - But thanks be to God, that you who were once slaves of sin have become obedient <b>from the heart</b> to the standard of teaching to which you were committed, and, having been set free from sin, have become slaves of righteousness. I am speaking in human terms, because of your natural limitations. For just as you once presented your members as slaves to impurity and to lawlessness leading to more lawlessness, so now present your members as <b>slaves to righteousness leading to sanctification.</b> When you were slaves of sin, you were free in regard to righteousness. But what fruit were you getting at that time from the things of which you are now ashamed? The end of those things is death.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
At the end of sanctification is eternal life:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Romans 6:22-23</b> - But now that you have been set free from sin and have become slaves of God, the fruit you get leads to sanctification and its end, eternal life. For the wages of sin is death, but the free gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.

Also, taking communion is about that.

<b>I Corinthians 2:11</b> - For who knows a person's thoughts except the spirit of that person, which is in him? So also no one comprehends the thoughts of God except the Spirit of God. Now we have received not the spirit of the world, but the Spirit who is from God, that we might understand the things freely given us by God. And we impart this in words not taught by human wisdom but taught by the Spirit, interpreting spiritual truths to those who are spiritual. The natural person does not accept the things of the Spirit of God, for they are folly to him, and he is not able to understand them because they are spiritually discerned. The spiritual person judges all things, but is himself to be judged by no one. For who has understood the mind of the Lord so as to instruct him? But we have the mind of Christ.

Interestingly, Jesus goes confidently back to Judea where the disciples were worried he would be stoned, but instead of someone killing Jesus, Jesus resurrects Lazarus. I guess it pays to walk while you have the light.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>John 11:11-15</b> - After saying these things, he said to them, Our friend Lazarus has fallen asleep, but I go to awaken him. The disciples said to him, Lord, if he has fallen asleep, he will recover. Now Jesus had spoken of his death, but they thought that he meant taking rest in sleep. Then Jesus told them plainly, Lazarus has died, and for your sake I am glad that I was not there, so that you may believe. But let us go to him. (ESV)

<p>

</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
It's not really the religion but who puts their faith in Jesus and <b>obeys</b> the gospel who will be saved.
</p>

<p>
But it is all by God's grace that we are saved. A believing and obedient heart is a trusting heart - a heart of faith - and our obedience gives us confidence. All glory to God alone. We must obey Jesus to become like Jesus:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>I John 4:17</b> - By this is love perfected with us, so that we may have confidence for the day of judgment, because as <span class="underline">he is so also are we in this world.</span> (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>John 7:24</b> - Do not judge by appearances, but judge with right judgment.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Therefore, I'd have more confidence if I was following Jesus is reality and <b>from the heart</b> but was caught up in incorrect theology, than if thought I had all the correct theology but didn't do what Jesus said.
</p>

<p>
Correct Christology is important, but so is obeying Jesus' commandments, and obeying Jesus' commandments is possibly even more important than belief:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Matthew 21:28-31</b> - “But what do you think? A man had two sons, and he came to the first and said, ‘Son, go work today in the vineyard.’ And he answered, ‘I will not’; but afterward he regretted it and went.  The man came to the second and said the same thing; and he answered, ‘I will, sir’; but he did not go.  <b>Which of the two did the will of his father?” They said, “The first.”</b> Jesus said to them, “Truly I say to you that <b>the tax collectors and prostitutes will get into the kingdom of God before you.</b>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
It's not the ones with the correct doctrine who will stand in the congregation of the righteous, but the ones who do the will of God:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Psalms 5:5</b> -  The boastful shall not stand before your eyes; you hate all evildoers.  (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
For that reason, I would have more confidence before God if I was serving Him, having put sin to death and trying to be holy and selfless and loving, than if I believed precise theology but had no changed life:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Psalms 1:4-5</b> - The wicked are not so, but are like chaff that the wind drives away. Therefore the wicked will not stand in the judgment, nor sinners in the congregation of the righteous; (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
We must keep ourselves in the love of God by obeying Jesus Christ's commandments, because we're awaiting to receive eternal life:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Jude 1:21</b> - <b>keep yourselves in the love of God,</b> waiting for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ that leads to eternal life. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Keeping Jesus Christ's commandments is a <span class="underline">requirement</span> to inherit eternal life, <span class="underline">not an extra</span>:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>John 15:10</b> - <b>If you keep my commandments, you will abide in my love,</b> just as I have kept my Father's commandments and abide in his love. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Whoever truly believes Jesus trusts in and is obedient to Jesus. We must obey Jesus Christ, and that obedience means being a slave of righteousness, leading to sanctification, which leads to eternal life:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>John 3:36</b> - Whoever believes in the Son has eternal life; whoever does not obey the Son shall not see life, but the wrath of God remains on him. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Therefore, I don't want to flat-out disqualify people who do not have precisely the correct doctrine or theology.
</p>

<p>
Jesus goes to those who hear His voice to bring them into His flock:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>John 10:16</b> - And I have other sheep that are not of this fold. I must bring them also, and they will listen to my voice. So there will be one flock, one shepherd. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Jesus Christ is God's servant. We are Jesus' servants. It is a kingdom of servants, obedient to God.
</p>

<p>
Not all religions are equal. There is only one true God, the Father of Jesus Christ who has revealed Himself in Jesus Christ.
</p>

<p>
The only way is Jesus:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>John 14:6</b> - Jesus said to him, I am the way, and the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>1 Corinthians 8:5-6</b> - For although there may be so-called gods in heaven or on earth-as indeed there are many gods and many lords- yet for us there is one God, the Father, from whom are all things and for whom we exist, and one Lord, Jesus Christ, through whom are all things and through whom we exist.

</p>

<b>Galatians 1:6-10</b> - I am astonished that you are so quickly deserting him who called you in the grace of Christ and are turning to a different gospel- not that there is another one, but there are some who trouble you and want to distort the gospel of Christ. But even if we or an angel from heaven should preach to you a gospel contrary to the one we preached to you, let him be accursed. As we have said before, so now I say again: If anyone is preaching to you a gospel contrary to the one you received, let him be accursed. For am I now seeking the approval of man, or of God? Or am I trying to please man? If I were still trying to please man, I would not be a servant of Christ. (ESV)

<b>Micah 4:1-13</b> - It shall come to pass in the latter days that the mountain of the house of the LORD shall be established as the highest of the mountains, and it shall be lifted up above the hills; and peoples shall flow to it, and many nations shall come, and say: Come, let us go up to the mountain of the LORD, to the house of the God of Jacob, that he may teach us his ways and that we may walk in his paths. For out of Zion shall go forth the law, and the word of the LORD from Jerusalem. He shall judge between many peoples, and shall decide for strong nations afar off; and they shall beat their swords into plowshares, and their spears into pruning hooks; nation shall not lift up sword against nation, neither shall they learn war anymore; but they shall sit every man under his vine and under his fig tree, and no one shall make them afraid, for the mouth of the LORD of hosts has spoken. For all the peoples walk each in the name of its god, but we will walk in the name of the LORD our God forever and ever. In that day, declares the LORD, I will assemble the lame and gather those who have been driven away and those whom I have afflicted; and the lame I will make the remnant, and those who were cast off, a strong nation; and the LORD will reign over them in Mount Zion from this time forth and forevermore. And you, O tower of the flock, hill of the daughter of Zion, to you shall it come, the former dominion shall come, kingship for the daughter of Jerusalem. Now why do you cry aloud? Is there no king in you? Has your counselor perished, that pain seized you like a woman in labor? Writhe and groan, O daughter of Zion, like a woman in labor, for now you shall go out from the city and dwell in the open country; you shall go to Babylon. There you shall be rescued; there the LORD will redeem you from the hand of your enemies. Now many nations are assembled against you, saying, Let her be defiled, and let our eyes gaze upon Zion. But they do not know the thoughts of the LORD; they do not understand his plan, that he has gathered them as sheaves to the threshing floor. Arise and thresh, O daughter of Zion, for I will make your horn iron, and I will make your hoofs bronze; you shall beat in pieces many peoples; and shall devote their gain to the LORD, their wealth to the Lord of the whole earth.

<b>I Corinthians 10:14-31</b> - Therefore, my beloved, flee from idolatry. I speak as to sensible people; judge for yourselves what I say. The cup of blessing that we bless, is it not a participation in the blood of Christ? The bread that we break, is it not a participation in the body of Christ? Because there is one bread, we who are many are one body, for we all partake of the one bread. Consider the people of Israel: are not those who eat the sacrifices participants in the altar? What do I imply then? That food offered to idols is anything, or that an idol is anything? No, I imply that what pagans sacrifice they offer to demons and not to God. I do not want you to be participants with demons. <b>You cannot drink the cup of the Lord and the cup of demons. You cannot partake of the table of the Lord and the table of demons</b>. Shall we provoke the Lord to jealousy? Are we stronger than he? All things are lawful, but not all things are helpful. All things are lawful, but not all things build up. Let no one seek his own good, but the good of his neighbor. Eat whatever is sold in the meat market without raising any question on the ground of conscience. For the earth is the Lord's, and the fullness thereof. If one of the unbelievers invites you to dinner and you are disposed to go, eat whatever is set before you without raising any question on the ground of conscience. But if someone says to you, This has been offered in sacrifice, then do not eat it, for the sake of the one who informed you, and for the sake of conscience— I do not mean your conscience, but his. For why should my liberty be determined by someone else's conscience? If I partake with thankfulness, why am I denounced because of that for which I give thanks? So, whether you eat or drink, or whatever you do, do all to the glory of God.

He answered, Have you not read that he who created them from the beginning made them male and female, and said, Therefore a man shall leave his father and his mother and hold fast to his wife, and they shall become one flesh? So they are no longer two but one flesh. What therefore God has joined together, let not man separate. They said to him, Why then did Moses command one to give a certificate of divorce and to send her away? He said to them, Because of your hardness of heart Moses allowed you to divorce your wives, but from the beginning it was not so.

The asceticism [of denying marriage] has no value in stopping the indulgence of the flesh:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Colossians 2:18</b> - Let no one disqualify you, insisting on <b>asceticism</b> and worship of angels, going on in detail about visions, puffed up without reason by his sensuous mind, (ESV)
</p>

<p>
<b>Colossians 2:23</b> - These have indeed an appearance of wisdom in promoting <b>self-made religion and asceticism and severity to the body, but they are of no value in stopping the indulgence of the flesh.</b> (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Marriage itself is good. So denying it for reasons of self-made religion / worldly precepts actually causes harm because it's not the truth.
</p>

<p>
Abraham was 10 years older than Sarah!
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Genesis 17:17</b> - Then Abraham fell on his face and laughed and said to himself, Shall a child be born to a man who is a hundred years old? Shall Sarah, who is ninety years old, bear a child? (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Demon spirits deny relationships because:
</p>

<p>
For example:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>worldly spirit through a person telling me I need to be financially successful first, or</li>
<li>a spirit of slander or gossip which keeps me isolated, or a rejection-spirit spreading gossip/slander among people around me, creating social anxiety, making it hard to socialise with people who would be good to talk to, or</li>
<li>a spirit spouse which thinks it's my spouse</li>
<li>if all of the above spirits start manifesting</li>
</ul>

<p>
As far as forsaking God's precepts for worldly precepts go, the truth is that while in God's favour, God provides, and we cooperate with God by working, etc. But if God doesn't want you to get a job at a particular time, you wont get a job, etc.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Acts 16:6</b> - And they went through the region of Phrygia and Galatia, having been <b>forbidden by the Holy Spirit to speak the word in Asia.</b> (ESV)

<p>
God's precept isn't that the rich are the only ones who are allowed to marry. Otherwise robots will be taking human wives before the poor are allowed to marry. I'm a Christian not a transhumanist. We've got to stick to God's precepts and go against the world:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>II Timothy 3:12</b> - Indeed, all who desire to live a godly life in Christ Jesus will be persecuted, (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>John 15:19</b> - If you were of the world, the world would love you as its own; but because you are not of the world, but I chose you out of the world, therefore the world hates you. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
We have to obey God. Jesus commandment is to give to the one that asks. If I had to choose between obeying Jesus and holding onto lots of money so I could get a wife, then it is the latter which is actually stealing, and stealing from God:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Matthew 5:42</b> - Give to the one who begs from you, and do not refuse the one who would borrow from you. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
And Jesus encourages us to have obedient faith in Him even to the point, even to the point where it gets difficult - no pain, no gain!
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Mark 12:41-44</b> - And he sat down opposite the treasury and watched the people putting money into the offering box. Many rich people put in large sums. And a poor widow came and put in two small copper coins, which make a penny. And he called his disciples to him and said to them, Truly, I say to you, this poor widow has put in more than all those who are contributing to the offering box. For they all contributed out of their abundance, but she <b>out of her poverty has put in everything she had, all she had to live on.</b> (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
We are walking by faith, and not sight, and to walk by faith is to actually see clearly, where to not walk in faith is actually to walk in darkness:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>II Corinthians 5:7</b> - for we walk by faith, not by sight. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Psalms 119:105</b> - Your word is a lamp to my feet and a light to my path. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
If satan keeps delaying and blocking my relationships until seeking a relationship with someone who would be good for me has become 'socially unacceptable', then only God can save me. Worldly people wont understand.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>John 10:10</b> - The thief comes only to steal and kill and destroy. I came that they may have life and have it abundantly. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The Bible doesn't say that marriage among consenting adults with large age gap is immoral or forbidden, as far as I understand, although I need to do a more comprehensive Bible study and perhaps pray about it. But thus far I haven't found anything and God hasn't said anything against it to me as far as I know. Gay marriage, however, is not blessed at all.
</p>

<p>
While I agree that lust, and impure motivations disqualify a relationship being seen as Biblically acceptable, there are certain things I think
are not intrinsically wrong, such as marriage between consenting adults with an age gap.
</p>

<p>
Worldly people will always discriminate against people who desire to live according to the Bible:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>II Timothy 3:12-13</b> - Indeed, all who desire to live a godly life in Christ Jesus will be persecuted, while evil people and impostors will go on from bad to worse, deceiving and being deceived. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
And worldly people will endorse worldly things like:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>having promiscuous relationships, messing around with age-gaps, and out-of-marriage relationships saying it's ok because it's not a serious relationship, and</li>
<li>endorsing gay marriage, etc. or whatever they can imagine</li>
</ul>

<p>
while worldly people will discriminate against:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>age-gap marriage between consenting adults</li>
<li>people who are actually obeying God</li>
</ul>

<p>
I have a very similar opinion to John Piper on this I think:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><a href="https://www.desiringgod.org/interviews/can-i-marry-a-woman-half-my-age">Can I Marry a Woman Half My Age? | Desiring God</a></li>
</ul>

<p>
Also, I won't accept accusations or condemnation from the enemy while I'm trying to do the will of God, being obedient to Jesus Christ:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Galatians 5:18</b> - But if you are led by the Spirit, you are not under the law. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
And even if I sin from time to time, especially as a consequence of being in a difficult situation due to persecution, I won't accept accusations or condemnation for that, because I'm following Jesus:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Galatians 2:17</b> - But if, in our endeavor to be justified in Christ, we too were found to be sinners, is Christ then a servant of sin? Certainly not! (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Also, I stress this verse again because if you're obeying God then the Mosaic law isn't meant for others to use it against you to condemn you. Literally, if your heart's in the right place, and you're being obedient to Jesus Christ then it's wrong for people to slap you with the Mosaic law:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Galatians 5:18</b> - But if you are led by the Spirit, you are not under the law. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>1 Timothy 1:8-11</b> - Now we know that the law is good, if one uses it lawfully, understanding this, that the law is not laid down for the just but for the lawless and disobedient, for the ungodly and sinners, for the unholy and profane, for those who strike their fathers and mothers, for murderers, the sexually immoral, men who practice <b>homosexuality</b>, enslavers, liars, perjurers, and whatever else is contrary to sound doctrine, in accordance with the glorious gospel of the blessed God with which I have been entrusted.

In the same way husbands should love their wives as their own bodies. He who loves his wife loves himself. For no one ever hated his own flesh, but nourishes and cherishes it, just as Christ does the church, because we are members of his body. Therefore a man shall leave his father and mother and hold fast to his wife, and the two shall become one flesh. This mystery is profound, and I am saying that it refers to Christ and the church. However, let each one of you love his wife as himself, and let the wife see that she respects her husband.

For when the foolish took their lamps, they took no oil with them, but the wise took flasks of oil with their lamps. As the bridegroom was delayed, they all became drowsy and slept. But at midnight there was a cry, Here is the bridegroom! Come out to meet him. Then all those virgins rose and trimmed their lamps. And the foolish said to the wise, Give us some of your oil, for our lamps are going out. But the wise answered, saying, Since there will not be enough for us and for you, go rather to the dealers and buy for yourselves. And while they were going to buy, the bridegroom came, and those who were ready went in with him to the marriage feast, and the door was shut. Afterward the other virgins came also, saying, Lord, lord, open to us. But he answered, Truly, I say to you, I do not know you. Watch therefore, for you know neither the day nor the hour.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-46-9">
<p>
I personally do not endorse gay marriage. When I have in the past, I repent of that.
</p>

<p>
That is not to say it is not possible to endorse it yourself (and take the consequences of that) but a person is accountable to God for that act of annulling one of His commandments.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Matthew 5:19</b> - Therefore whoever relaxes one of the least of these commandments and teaches others to do the same will be called least in the kingdom of heaven, but whoever does them and teaches them will be called great in the kingdom of heaven.

<p>
So I believe that because I do not / no longer
endorse gay marriage for others, I do not
endorse it for myself, and I'll be held to
that standard.

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Leviticus 18:22</b> - You shall not lie with a male as with a woman; it is an abomination. (ESV)

<p>
However, endorsing gay marriage is not merely breaking commandment, but also it is contrary to the spiritual reality:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Genesis 2:22-24</b> - And the rib that the Lord God had taken from the man he made into a woman and brought her to the man. Then the man said, This at last is bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh; she shall be called Woman, because she was taken out of Man. Therefore a man shall leave his father and his mother and hold fast to his wife, and they shall become one flesh. (ESV)

Hot indignation seizes me because of the wicked, who forsake your law. Your statutes have been my songs in the house of my sojourning. I remember your name in the night, O LORD, and keep your law. This blessing has fallen to me, that I have kept your precepts. The LORD is my portion; I promise to keep your words. Heth I entreat your favor with all my heart; be gracious to me according to your promise.

At midnight I rise to praise you, because of your righteous rules. I am a companion of all who fear you, of those who keep your precepts. The earth, O LORD, is full of your steadfast love; teach me your statutes! You have dealt well with your servant, O LORD, according to your word. Teth Teach me good judgment and knowledge, for I believe in your commandments. Before I was afflicted I went astray, but now I keep your word. You are good and do good; teach me your statutes. The insolent smear me with lies, but with my whole heart I keep your precepts; their heart is unfeeling like fat, but I delight in your law. It is good for me that I was afflicted, that I might learn your statutes. The law of your mouth is better to me than thousands of gold and silver pieces.

I know, O LORD, that your rules are righteous, and that in faithfulness you have afflicted me. Let your steadfast love comfort me according to your promise to your servant. Let your mercy come to me, that I may live; for your law is my delight. Let the insolent be put to shame, because they have wronged me with falsehood; as for me, I will meditate on your precepts. Let those who fear you turn to me, that they may know your testimonies. May my heart be blameless in your statutes, that I may not be put to shame!

Forever, O LORD, your word is firmly fixed in the heavens. Lamedh Your faithfulness endures to all generations; you have established the earth, and it stands fast. By your appointment they stand this day, for all things are your servants. If your law had not been my delight, I would have perished in my affliction.

Yes, it is an issue in the law and in God's design, and gay marriage is not endorsed or blessed by God.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Matthew 5:14-20</b> - You are the light of the world. A city set on a hill cannot be hidden. Nor do people light a lamp and put it under a basket, but on a stand, and it gives light to all in the house.

<p>
I currently believe this means that grace may possibly

God is the justifier.

They have to be practicing righteousness, through following Jesus Christ - and obeying Jesus' commandments:

Amen. For this reason God gave them up to dishonorable passions. For their women exchanged natural relations for those that are contrary to nature; and the men likewise gave up natural relations with women and were consumed with passion for one another, men committing shameless acts with men and receiving in themselves the due penalty for their error. And since they did not see fit to acknowledge God, God gave them up to a debased mind to do what ought not to be done. They were filled with all manner of unrighteousness, evil, covetousness, malice. They are full of envy, murder, strife, deceit, maliciousness. They are gossips, slanderers, haters of God, insolent, haughty, boastful, inventors of evil, disobedient to parents, foolish, faithless, heartless, ruthless.

<p>
The Apostles prioritised themselves to focus on prayer and devotion to the ministry of the word over serving at tables, because it was more important for them to focus on the ministry of the word:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Acts 6:2-4</b> - Then the twelve called the multitude of the disciples unto them, and said, It is not reason that we should leave the word of God, and serve tables. Wherefore, brethren, look ye out among you seven men of honest report, full of the Holy Ghost and wisdom, whom we may appoint over this business. But we will give ourselves continually to prayer, and to the ministry of the word.

</blockquote>

<p>
Also Paul says he does indeed have the right to be a burden on others (because, I assume, they have given themselves to prayer and the ministry of the word), but rather he wants to be a good example for others to follow on how a Christian should work.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>2 Thessalonians 3:8-10</b> - nor did we eat anyone's bread without paying for it, but with toil and labor we worked night and day, that we might not be a burden to any of you.

<p>
<b>Mark 4:3-20</b> - Listen! A sower went out to sow.  And as he sowed, some seed fell along the path, and the birds came and devoured it.  Other seed fell on rocky ground, where it did not have much soil, and immediately it sprang up, since it had no depth of soil.  And when the sun rose it was scorched, and since it had no root, it withered away.  Other seed fell among thorns, and the thorns grew up and choked it, and it yielded no grain.  And other seeds fell into good soil and produced grain, growing up and increasing and yielding thirtyfold and sixtyfold and a hundredfold.  And he said, He who has ears to hear, let him hear.  And when he was alone, those around him with the twelve asked him about the parables.  And he said to them, To you has been given the secret of the kingdom of God, but for those outside everything is in parables, so that they may indeed see but not perceive, and may indeed hear but not understand, lest they should turn and be forgiven.  And he said to them, Do you not understand this parable? How then will you understand all the parables?  The sower sows the word.  And these are the ones along the path, where the word is sown: when they hear, Satan immediately comes and takes away the word that is sown in them.  And these are the ones sown on rocky ground: the ones who, when they hear the word, immediately receive it with joy.  And they have no root in themselves, but endure for a while; then, when tribulation or persecution arises on account of the word, immediately they fall away.  And others are the ones sown among thorns. They are those who hear the word, but the cares of the world and the deceitfulness of riches and the desires for other things enter in and choke the word, and it proves unfruitful.  But those that were sown on the <b>good soil</b> are <b>the ones who hear the word and accept it and bear fruit</b>, thirtyfold and sixtyfold and a hundredfold.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Good soil:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Hears the word</li>
<li>Accepts the word</li>
<li>Bears fruit</li>
</ul>

<p>
The word is spoken to us and we must receive it and nurture it and produce fruit:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>John 15:3-4</b> - Already you are clean because of the word that I have spoken to you. Abide in me, and I in you. As the branch cannot bear fruit by itself, unless it abides in the vine, neither can you, unless you abide in me.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
To bear fruit involves sacrificing this life for the advancement of the kingdom:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>John 12:24-25</b> - Truly, truly, I say to you, unless a grain of wheat falls into the earth and dies, it remains alone; but if it dies, it bears much fruit. Whoever loves his life loses it, and whoever hates his life in this world will keep it for eternal life.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
If your fruit abides then whatever you ask the Father in Jesus' name, He may give you:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>John 15:16</b> - You did not choose me, but I chose you and appointed you that you should go and bear fruit and that your fruit should abide, so that whatever you ask the Father in my name, he may give it to you.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
God takes away fruitless branches:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>John 15:2</b> - Every branch of mine that does not bear fruit he takes away, and every branch that does bear fruit he prunes, that it may bear more fruit.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
We must be fruitful branches, abiding in Jesus:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>John 15:5</b> - I am the vine; you are the branches. Whoever abides in me and I in him, he it is that bears much fruit, for apart from me you can do nothing.

</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Jesus helped Thomas believe by giving him a commandment to do. It's implied that Thomas obeyed and arrived at belief.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>John 20:29-31</b> - Jesus said to him, Have you believed because you have seen me? Blessed are those who have not seen and yet have believed.  Now Jesus did many other signs in the presence of the disciples, which are not written in this book; but these are written so that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that by believing you may have life in his name.

<p>
There's abiding in Christ, and then there is ABIDING FOREVER in Christ, and forever in God.

</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
I believe that to abide forever in Christ, one must produce good fruit.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Matthew 3:8-10</b> - Bear fruit in keeping with repentance.  And do not presume to say to yourselves, We have Abraham as our father, for I tell you, God is able from these stones to raise up children for Abraham.  Even now the axe is laid to the root of the trees. Every tree therefore that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
I believe that producing good fruit is necessary for being saved:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>a heart that is turning away from sin</li>
<li>believing the Gospel and obeying Jesus</li>

</p>

<blockquote>

Look, I tell you, lift up your eyes, and see that the fields are white for harvest. Already the one who reaps is receiving wages and gathering fruit for eternal life, so that sower and reaper may rejoice together. For here the saying holds true, One sows and another reaps. I sent you to reap that for which you did not labor. Others have labored, and you have entered into their labor.
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>II John 1:2</b> - because of the truth that abides in us and will be with us forever:

<p>
Jesus' teaching is from Father God. We are supposed to obey Jesus Christ, and that's obeying God:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>II John 1:9</b> - Everyone who goes on ahead and does not abide in the teaching of Christ, does not have God. Whoever abides in the teaching has both the Father and the Son.

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Mark 3:35</b> - Whoever does the will of God, he is my brother and sister and mother.

<p>
The will of God must be discerned through testing with a renewed mind:

<p>
Loving one another is the will of God:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>II Corinthians 8:3-5</b> - For they gave according to their means, as I can testify, and beyond their means, <b>of their own free will</b>, begging us earnestly for the favor of taking part in the relief of the saints— and this, not as we expected, but they <span class="underline">gave themselves first to the Lord</span> and <b>then by the will of God to us.</b> (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Controlling our own body in holiness and honor is the will of God:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>I Thessalonians 4:3-5</b> - For this is the will of God, your sanctification: that you abstain from sexual immorality; that each one of you know how to control his own body in holiness and honor, not in the passion of lust like the Gentiles who do not know God; (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The will of God is that by doing good you should put to silence the ignorance of foolish people:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>I Peter 2:15</b> - For this is the will of God, that by doing good you should put to silence the ignorance of foolish people. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The will of God is that we should not be materialistic or worldly:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>I John 2:15-17</b> - Do not love the world or the things in the world. If anyone loves the world, the love of the Father is not in him. For all that is in the world—the desires of the flesh and the desires of the eyes and pride in possessions—is not from the Father but is from the world. And the world is passing away along with its desires, but whoever does the will of God abides forever. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
After doing the will of God, and not shrinking back, we receive what is promised:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Hebrews 10:36-38</b> - For you have need of endurance, so that when you have done the will of God you may receive what is promised. For, Yet a little while, and the coming one will come and will not delay; but my righteous one shall live by faith, and if he shrinks back, my soul has no pleasure in him. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
We must believe in Jesus Christ and follow Jesus Christ's teaching:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>John 6:28-40</b> - Then they said to him, What must we do, to be doing the works of God? Jesus answered them, This is the work of God, that you believe in him whom he has sent. So they said to him, Then what sign do you do, that we may see and believe you? What work do you perform? Our fathers ate the manna in the wilderness; as it is written, He gave them bread from heaven to eat.

For the bread of God is he who comes down from heaven and gives life to the world.

But I said to you that you have seen me and yet do not believe. All that the Father gives me will come to me, and <span class="underline">whoever comes to me</span> I will never cast out. For I have come down from heaven, not to do my own will but the will of him who sent me. And this is the <span class="underline">will of him who sent me, that I should lose nothing of all that he has given me, but raise it up on the last day.

God's name was <b>in</b> the angel:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Exodus 23:20-22</b> - Behold, I send an angel before you to guard you on the way and to bring you to the place that I have prepared. Pay careful attention to him and obey his voice; do not rebel against him, for he will not pardon your transgression, for my name is in him. But if you <b>carefully obey his voice and do all that I say</b>, then I will be an enemy to your enemies and an adversary to your adversaries.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Believing is just the starting point. This is honestly just the starting point. Obedience is <b>expected</b>. Also, Jesus is forgiving, unlike the angel.
</p>

<p>
Continuing to trust in Jesus as the Messiah, your Saviour, and the Only-begotten Son of God through patient endurance is enough to get saved, I think, but it's not enough to be counted a 'disciple' of Jesus.
</p>

<p>
And it's 'saved' but 'being saved' at the same time.
</p>

<p>
One wants to progress from 'believing that' to having Jesus abide inside them.
</p>

<p>
I think that rejects His commandments but claiming to believe in Jesus Christ as the Son of God is an extremely precarious, and tentative position to be in,
and may indicate that the person doesn't <b>really</b> believe.
</p>

<p>
And if a person doesn't believe in reality, then that person probably isn't saved - so they are only lying to themself that they are saved.
</p>

<p>
<b>However</b>, if a person trusts him who justifies the ungodly, his faith is counted as righteousness.
</p>

<p>
Trusting Him means having faith in Him, obeying. Ungodly here means wicked.

<p>
Following Jesus doesn't mean not providing for family. In fact, following Jesus does mean providing for family.
So when you read Jesus' commandments and someone asks you for help, you give them what they need, without stealing though. If the money is for taking care of family, we must keep that. But our neighbour who we must love are more than just our immediate family. We are commanded by the Apostle Paul to provide for our family:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>I Timothy 5:8</b> - But if anyone does not provide for his relatives, and especially for members of his household, he has denied the faith and is worse than an unbeliever. (ESV)

Whoever loves father or mother more than me is not worthy of me, and whoever loves son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me.

And the manager said to himself, What shall I do, since my master is taking the management away from me? I am not strong enough to dig, and I am ashamed to beg. I have decided what to do, so that when I am removed from management, people may receive me into their houses. So, summoning his master's debtors one by one, he said to the first, How much do you owe my master? He said, A hundred measures of oil. He said to him, Take your bill, and sit down quickly and write fifty. Then he said to another, And how much do you owe? He said, A hundred measures of wheat.

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>John 15:6</b> - If anyone does not abide in me he is thrown away like a branch and withers; and the branches are gathered, thrown into the fire, and burned. (ESV)

Yet they can be grafted back in:

<b>Romans 11:23</b> - And even they, if they do not continue in their unbelief, will be grafted in, for God has the power to graft them in again.

So take stopping sin seriously, and keep Jesus' words and His commandments, and also bearing fruit for Jesus.

These things I have spoken to you, that my joy may be in you, and that your joy may be full. This is my commandment, that you love one another as I have loved you. Greater love has no one than this, that someone lays down his life for his friends. You are my friends if you do what I command you.

<b>Romans 11:15-32</b> - For if their rejection means the reconciliation of the world, what will their acceptance mean but life from the dead? If the dough offered as firstfruits is holy, so is the whole lump, and if the root is holy, so are the branches. But if some of the branches were broken off, and you, although a wild olive shoot, were grafted in among the others and now share in the nourishing root of the olive tree, do not be arrogant toward the branches. If you are, remember it is not you who support the root, but the root that supports you. Then you will say, Branches were broken off so that I might be grafted in. That is true. They were broken off because of their unbelief, but you stand fast through faith. So do not become proud, but stand in awe. For if God did not spare the natural branches, neither will he spare you. Note then the kindness and the severity of God: severity toward those who have fallen, but God's kindness to you, provided you continue in his kindness. Otherwise you too will be cut off. And even they, if they do not continue in their unbelief, will be grafted in, for God has the power to graft them in again. For if you were cut from what is by nature a wild olive tree, and grafted, contrary to nature, into a cultivated olive tree, how much more will these, the natural branches, be grafted back into their own olive tree. Lest you be wise in your own conceits, I want you to understand this mystery, brothers: a partial hardening has come upon Israel, until the fullness of the Gentiles has come in. And in this way all Israel will be saved, as it is written, The Deliverer will come from Zion, he will banish ungodliness from Jacob; and this will be my covenant with them when I take away their sins. As regards the gospel, they are enemies of God for your sake. But as regards election, they are beloved for the sake of their forefathers. For the gifts and the calling of God are irrevocable. Just <span class="underline">as you were at one time disobedient to God</span> but now have received mercy because of their disobedience, so they too have now been disobedient in order that by the mercy shown to you they also may now receive mercy. For <span class="underline">God has consigned all to disobedience, that he may have mercy on all.</span>

Firstly, Paul commends going above and even beyond one's means:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>II Corinthians 8:3-5</b> - For they gave according to their means, as I can testify, and beyond their means, <b>of their own free will</b>, begging us earnestly for the favor of taking part in the relief of the saints— and this, not as we expected, but they <span class="underline">gave themselves first to the Lord</span> and <b>then by the will of God to us.</b> (ESV)

There is an amount of how much a person is following Jesus:
</p>

<p>
<i>"resisted to the point of shedding your blood."</i>
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Hebrews 12:1-11</b> - Therefore, since we are surrounded by so great a cloud of witnesses, let us also lay aside every weight, and sin which clings so closely, and let us run with endurance the race that is set before us, looking to Jesus, the <b>founder</b> and <b>perfecter</b> of our <b>faith</b>, who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross, despising the shame, and is seated at the right hand of the throne of God. Consider him who endured from sinners such hostility against himself, so that you may not grow weary or fainthearted. In your struggle against sin you have <span class="underline">not yet resisted to the point of shedding your blood</span>. And have you forgotten the exhortation that addresses you as sons? My son, do not regard lightly the discipline of the Lord, nor be weary when reproved by him. For the Lord disciplines the one he loves, and chastises every son whom he receives. It is for discipline that you have to endure. God is treating you as sons. For what son is there whom his father does not discipline? <b>If you are left without discipline, in which all have participated, then you are illegitimate children and not sons</b>. Besides this, we have had earthly fathers who disciplined us and we respected them. Shall we not much more be subject to the Father of spirits and live? For they disciplined us for a short time as it seemed best to them, but he disciplines us for our good, that we may <b>share his holiness</b>. For the moment all discipline seems painful rather than pleasant, but later it yields the peaceful <b>fruit of righteousness</b> to those who have been trained by it.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
If a person is obedient and doing the will of God then God can use that person's human will and exertion. Jesus was faithful to God. Jesus was obedient to God.
</p>

<p>
I'm reluctant to use external sources outside of the Bible, but this is also described in the Didache.
</p>

<p>
The Didache's estimated range of dating is 50-120 A.D, according to <a href="https://www.earlychristianwritings.com/text/didache-roberts.html">earlychristianwritings.com</a>.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Didache Chapter 6</b> - See that no one causes you to err from this way of the Teaching, since apart from God it teaches you. For if you are able to bear the entire yoke of the Lord, you will be perfect; but if you are not able to do this, do what you are able.
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Matthew 5:47-48</b> - And if you greet only your brothers, what more are you doing than others? Do not even the Gentiles do the same? You therefore must be perfect, as your heavenly Father is perfect.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Of course, I believe God doesn't send all His servants to be martyred, but probably uses what amount a person is willing to bear for the Lord Jesus.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Matthew 19:21</b> - Jesus said to him, If you would be perfect, go, sell what you possess and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; and come, follow me.
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>

Everyone who names the name of the Lord must depart from iniquity:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>II Timothy 2:19-22</b> - But God's firm foundation stands, bearing this seal: The Lord knows those who are his, and, Let everyone who names the name of the Lord depart from iniquity. Now in a great house there are not only vessels of gold and silver but also of wood and clay, some for honorable use, some for dishonorable. Therefore, if anyone cleanses himself from what is dishonorable, he will be a vessel for honorable use, set apart as holy, useful to the master of the house, ready for every good work. So flee youthful passions and pursue righteousness, faith, love, and peace, along with those who call on the Lord from a pure heart.

<p>
Following Jesus means obeying Jesus:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>John 8:12</b> - Again Jesus spoke to them, saying, I am the light of the world. Whoever follows me will not walk in darkness, but will have the light of life.
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>John 9:5</b> - As long as I am in the world, I am the light of the world.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Jesus instructed his his disciples to be holy:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Matthew 5:14-20</b> - You are the light of the world. A city set on a hill cannot be hidden. Nor do people light a lamp and put it under a basket, but on a stand, and it gives light to all in the house. In the same way, let your light shine before others, so that they may see your good works and give glory to your Father who is in heaven. Do not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them. For truly, I say to you, until heaven and earth pass away, not an iota, not a dot, will pass from the Law until all is accomplished. Therefore whoever relaxes one of the least of these commandments and teaches others to do the same will be called least in the kingdom of heaven, but whoever does them and teaches them will be called great in the kingdom of heaven. For I tell you, <span class="underline">unless your righteousness exceeds that of the scribes and Pharisees, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven</span>.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
I believe following Jesus includes exercising personal righteousness/holiness.
</p>

<p>
I believe that God's grace extends to all who
put their faith in Jesus and have Jesus'
righteousness imputed onto them, the
righteousness of faith in Jesus Christ God's
Son who has paid through his blood the price
for our sin.
</p>

<p>
Imputed righteousness is important, but we need also personal holiness.
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8rmiZRzqfg">Holiness Demanded - Charles Spurgeon Sermon - YouTube</a></li>

<p>
We must live in holiness. This is practical holiness, the opposite of impurity.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Hebrews 12:14</b> - Pursue peace with all men, and the sanctification without which no one will see the Lord.

<p>
In his "Introduction to Romans," Luther stated that saving faith is,
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
"a living, creative, active and powerful thing, this faith. Faith cannot help doing good works constantly. It doesn't stop to ask if good works ought to be done, but before anyone asks, it already has done them and continues to do them without ceasing. Anyone who does not do good works in this manner is an unbeliever… Thus, it is just as impossible to separate faith and works as it is to separate heat and light from fire!"

</p>

<p>
AMEN!!
</p>

<p>
I believe one must know that God's law is right:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Romans 7:9-16</b> - I was once alive apart from the law, but when the commandment came, sin came alive and I died. The very commandment that promised life proved to be death to me. For sin, seizing an opportunity through the commandment, deceived me and through it killed me. So the law is holy, and the commandment is holy and righteous and good. Did that which is good, then, bring death to me? By no means! It was sin, producing death in me through what is good, in order that sin might be shown to be sin, and through the commandment might become sinful beyond measure. For we know that the law is spiritual, but I am of the flesh, sold under sin. I do not understand my own actions. For I do not do what I want, but I do the very thing I hate. Now if I do what I do not want, I agree with the law, that it is good. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
When presented with God's law, we should
recognise that the law is right and recognise
our transgression, and continue towards
sanctification, putting off the old, sinful
self.
</p>

<p>
We are released from the law, and now we <b>serve</b> <span class="underline">in the new life of the Spirit</span>:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Romans 7:6-7</b> - But now we are released from the law, having died to that which held us captive, so that we serve not under the old written code but in the new life of the Spirit. What then shall we say? That the law is sin? By no means! Yet if it had not been for the law, I would not have known sin. I would not have known what it is to covet if the law had not said, You shall not covet. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
We believe in Christ Jesus in order to be justified by faith in Christ:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Galatians 2:16</b> - yet we know that a person is not justified by works of the law but through faith in Jesus Christ, so we also have believed in Christ Jesus, in order to be justified by faith in Christ and not by works of the law, because by works of the law no one will be justified. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
So we're not trying to come under the 613 commandments of the Mosaic law,
but the precepts such as "do not covet", and "do not commit idolatry", easily seen
within the 10 commandments still describe how we should behave.
</p>

<p>
But we also don't teach people that the 613 commandments of the Mosaic law are annulled. They're not annulled. We're just not under them, because we're under the law of Christ instead:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Matthew 5:17-18</b> - Do not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them. For truly, I say to you, until heaven and earth pass away, not an iota, not a dot, will pass from the Law until all is accomplished. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Heaven and earth have not passed away yet and neither has the Law:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Luke 16:17</b> - But it is easier for heaven and earth to pass away than for one dot of the Law to become void. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
<b>If</b> we are led by the spirit (if we're serving Jesus Christ, seeking justification through faith in Jesus Christ) then we are not under the Mosaic law:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Galatians 5:18</b> - But <b>if</b> you are led by the Spirit, you are not under the law. Now the works of the flesh are evident: sexual immorality, impurity, sensuality, idolatry, sorcery, enmity, strife, jealousy, fits of anger, rivalries, dissensions, divisions, envy, drunkenness, orgies, and things like these. I warn you, as I warned you before, that those who do such things will not inherit the kingdom of God.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
So we should still stop sinning as it is described:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>I Timothy 1:9</b> - understanding this, that the law is not laid down for the just but for the lawless and disobedient, for the ungodly and sinners, for the unholy and profane, for those who strike their fathers and mothers, for murderers, (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>I Peter 4:1</b> - Since therefore Christ suffered in the flesh, arm yourselves with the same way of thinking, for whoever has suffered in the flesh has ceased from sin, (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
We're under grace, and we're supposed to not be enslaved to sin, neither are we supposed to be enslaved under the Mosaic law. The Mosaic law isn't a curse to us.
</p>

<p>
Things like pornography probably attracts evil spirits which hinders finding a relationship, and obviously, we still want to obey God's precepts for our own good:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><a href="https://youtu.be/qu8QxxIF4UE?t=520">Prayers Against Evil Attacks During Sleep - Powerful Prayers Against Bad Dreams and Nightmares - YouTube</a></li>
</ul>

<p>
Of course we still need to be sanctified and stop sinning, following Jesus.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Hebrews 12:14,15</b> -  Strive for peace with everyone, and for the holiness without which no one will see the Lord.  See to it that no one fails to obtain the grace of God; that no root of bitterness springs up and causes trouble, and by it many become defiled;  (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
But sin is rather described in such a way:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Galatians 5:19-21</b> - Now the works of the flesh are evident: sexual immorality, impurity, sensuality, idolatry, sorcery, enmity, strife, jealousy, fits of anger, rivalries, dissensions, divisions, envy, drunkenness, orgies, and things like these. I warn you, as I warned you before, that those who do such things will not inherit the kingdom of God. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
We must instead be led by the Spirit:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Galatians 5:22-25</b> - But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, self-control; against such things there is no law. And those who belong to Christ Jesus have crucified the flesh with its passions and desires. If we live by the Spirit, let us also walk by the Spirit. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>I Thessalonians 3:13</b> - so that He may establish your hearts without blame in holiness before our God and Father at the coming of our Lord Jesus with all His saints.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
I consider practicing homosexuality to be erroneous and sinful, and God's original design to be correct.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Matthew 19:4-12</b> - He answered, Have you not read that he who created them <b>from the beginning made them male and female</b>, and said, Therefore a man shall leave his father and his mother and hold fast to his wife, and they shall become one flesh?  So they are no longer two but one flesh. What therefore God has joined together, let not man separate.  They said to him, Why then did Moses command one to give a certificate of divorce and to send her away?  He said to them, Because of your hardness of heart Moses allowed you to divorce your wives, but <b>from the beginning it was not so</b>.  And I say to you: whoever divorces his wife, except for sexual immorality, and marries another, commits adultery.  The disciples said to him, If such is the case of a man with his wife, it is better not to marry.  But he said to them, Not everyone can receive this saying, but only those to whom it is given.  For there are eunuchs who have been so from birth, and there are eunuchs who have been made eunuchs by men, and there are eunuchs who have made themselves eunuchs for the sake of the kingdom of heaven. Let the one who is able to receive this receive it.
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Romans 1:26-27</b> - For this reason God gave them up to dishonorable passions. For their women exchanged natural relations for those that are contrary to nature; and the men likewise gave up natural relations with women and were consumed with passion for one another, men committing shameless acts with men and receiving in themselves the <b>due penalty for their error</b>.

This is following the law by faith, I think; Truly loving God and one's neighbour.
</p>

<p>
There are a lot of 'do nots' in the law but the most important thing is the 2 'do' commandments.
The 'do nots' are to stop people from doing bad things, but the 2 Greatest commandments command us to love God and our neighbour.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Matthew 22:37-40</b> - And he said to him, You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind. This is the great and first commandment. And a second is like it: You shall love your neighbor as yourself. On these two commandments depend all the Law and the Prophets.

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Colossians 3:4-9</b> - When Christ who is your life appears, then you also will appear with him in glory. Put to death therefore what is earthly in you: sexual immorality, impurity, passion, evil desire, and covetousness, which is idolatry. On account of these the wrath of God is coming. In these you too once walked, when you were living in them. But now you must put them all away: anger, wrath, malice, slander, and obscene talk from your mouth. Do not lie to one another, seeing that you have put off the old self with its practices

If a newly born-again Christian is spending all their time with sinners though and endorsing continually instead of being discipled, then they can

<p>
Not the best example, but, for example, when someone says you owe them money, and you can see they are blind, it's paying them because you're the one submitting to God.
It's humbling yourself even to others and following God's commandments in truth and reality, with a real faith relationship with God.
It's serving others as Jesus has served us.
It's keeping accountable to God and maintaining faithfulness to God, not keeping others accountable to you.

There is only the one gospel message: the same gospel that Paul, Jesus, Peter and John preached.
</p>

<p>
Paul preached the same gospel as Jesus before
His crucifixion, and the same gospel that
Peter and John preached, but some people think
Paul's gospel is different - but that is
because they have been deceived by the two-gospel heresy:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><a href="https://antonbosch.org/the-two-gospel-heresy">The Two Gospel Heresy - Anton Bosch</a></li>
</ul>

<p>
Even before His crucifixion, it's clear Jesus taught the New Covenant:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Luke 22:20</b> - And likewise the cup after they had eaten, saying, This cup that is poured out for you is the new covenant in my blood. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
And according to Paul, Jesus' commands are still binding:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Acts 20:35</b> - In all things I have shown you that by working hard in this way we must help the weak and remember the words of the Lord Jesus, how he himself said, It is more blessed to give than to receive. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>I Corinthians 11:24-25</b> - and when he had given thanks, he broke it, and said, This is my body which is for you. Do this in remembrance of me. In the same way also he took the cup, after supper, saying, This cup is the new covenant in my blood. Do this, as often as you drink it, in remembrance of me. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Jesus' words do not pass away, and the truths He spoke before being crucified remain true:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Matthew 24:35</b> - Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will not pass away.  (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Jesus' words are the words of eternal life:

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>John 6:68</b> -  Simon Peter answered him, Lord, to whom shall we go?  You have the words of eternal life,  (ESV)
</p>

<p>
To be raised up as a child of Abraham, bear fruit in keeping with repentance:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Luke 3:8</b> - <span class="underline">Bear fruits in keeping with repentance.</span> And do not begin to say to yourselves, We have Abraham as our father. For I tell you, <span class="underline">God is able from these stones to raise up children for Abraham.</span>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
To be justified, a person must <span class="underline">walk in the footsteps of the faith that our father Abraham had before he was circumcised</span>, I believe with having faith in Jesus Christ:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Romans 4:9-12</b> - Is this blessing then only for the circumcised, or also for the uncircumcised? We say that faith was counted to Abraham as righteousness. How then was it counted to him? Was it before or after he had been circumcised? It was not after, but before he was circumcised. He received the sign of circumcision as a seal of the righteousness that he had by faith while he was still uncircumcised. The purpose was to make him the father of all who believe without being circumcised, so that righteousness would be counted to them as well, and to make him the father of the circumcised who are <span class="underline">not merely circumcised but who also walk in the footsteps of the faith that our father Abraham had before he was circumcised</span>.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
How do we become sons of Abraham:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2xzr8ZJpn8">How Do Gentiles Become Sons of Abraham? Galatians 3:6a??9, Part 3 - YouTube</a></li>
</ul>

<p>
I do believe that trusting inevitably bears fruit. Also Abraham obeyed God's commandments - that's all tied up inside the faith which Abraham had towards God.
We must have faith in God, too, but with respect to having faith in Jesus Christ, following Jesus Christ.
</p>

<p>
It is because of what Jesus Christ has accomplished through His obedience to God, His death and resurrection, that having faith in Him is effective.
Everyone <b>in Christ</b> has Him as their High Priest.
</p>

<p>
We must be a <b>child of Abraham.</b> The blessing comes through being counted as sons of Abraham.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Romans 9:7-8</b> - and not all are children of Abraham because they are his offspring, but Through Isaac shall your offspring be named. This means that it is not the children of the flesh who are the children of God, but <span class="underline">the children of the promise are counted as offspring.</span> (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Genesis 17:4</b> - Behold, my covenant is with you, and you shall be the father of a multitude of nations. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The sign of circumcision was a seal of righteousness that he had by faith while he was still uncircumcised
This righteousness by faith was not based on lawkeeping.
The purpose was to make him the father of all who believe without being circumcised so righteousness can be counted to them as well.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Romans 4:11-12</b> - He received the sign of circumcision as a seal of the righteousness that he had by faith while he was still uncircumcised. The purpose was to make him the father of all who believe without being circumcised, so that righteousness would be counted to them as well, and to make him the father of the circumcised who are not merely circumcised but who also walk in the footsteps of the faith that our father Abraham had before he was circumcised. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The promises go to Christ:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Galatians 3:16</b> - Now the promises were made to Abraham and to his offspring. It does not say, And to offsprings, referring to many, but referring to one, And to your offspring, who is Christ. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
If you belong to Christ by faith then you are one in spirit with Christ and Abraham's offspring, and heirs according to the promise.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Galatians 3:29</b> - And if you are Christ's, then you are Abraham's offspring, heirs according to promise. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Jesus Christ's blood is the atonement for our sin.
</p>

<p>
We should also become obedient to Him - we must have faith in Jesus.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>John 8:39</b> - They answered him, Abraham is our father. Jesus said to them, If you were Abraham's children, you <span class="underline">would be doing what Abraham did</span>,
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
One of the blessings is that we are counted as righteous before God, because we have faith in Jesus, loving Jesus.
</p>

<p>
Another promise is that we would be an heir of the world. We belong to the Messiah. In the Messiah, God can make promises such as this to His chosen people:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Romans 4:13</b> - For the promise to Abraham and his offspring that he would be heir of the world did not come through the law but through the righteousness of faith. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Another promise is that in Christ (in union with Christ), the blessing of Abraham might come to the Gentiles so that we together Jew, and Gentile, might receive the promised Spirit (God's Spirit) through faith:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Galatians 3:13-14</b> - Christ redeemed us from the curse of the law by becoming a curse for us—for it is written, Cursed is everyone who is hanged on a tree— so that in Christ Jesus the blessing of Abraham might come to the Gentiles, so that we might receive the promised Spirit through faith. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
God can raise up children from anyone who has repentance and may grant being a child of Abraham to anyone who walks in the footsteps of the faith that Abraham had before he was circumcised.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Luke 3:3-8</b> - And he went into all the region around the Jordan, proclaiming a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins.

Every valley shall be filled, and every mountain and hill shall be made low, and the crooked shall become straight, and the rough places shall become level ways, and all flesh shall see the salvation of God. He said therefore to the crowds that came out to be baptized by him, You brood of vipers! Who warned you to flee from the wrath to come? <span class="underline">Bear fruits in keeping with repentance</span>. And do not begin to say to yourselves, We have Abraham as our father. For I tell you, <span class="underline">God is able from these stones to raise up children for Abraham.</span>

<b>Galatians 3:13-14</b> - Christ redeemed us from the curse of the law by becoming a curse for us—for it is written, Cursed is everyone who is hanged on a tree— so that in Christ Jesus the blessing of Abraham might come to the Gentiles, so that we might receive the promised Spirit through faith.

<p>
John the Baptist even taught people to love one another:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Luke 3:11-15</b> - And he answered them, Whoever has two tunics is to share with him who has none, and whoever has food is to do likewise. Tax collectors also came to be baptized and said to him, Teacher, what shall we do? And he said to them, Collect no more than you are authorized to do. Soldiers also asked him, And we, what shall we do? And he said to them, Do not extort money from anyone by threats or by false accusation, and be content with your wages. As the people were in expectation, and all were questioning in their hearts concerning John, whether he might be the Christ,
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
And I assume that repentance and loving one's neighbour are good precursors to being baptised by Jesus with <b>the Holy Spirit</b> and fire:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Luke 3:16</b> - John answered them all, saying, I baptize you with water, but he who is mightier than I is coming, the strap of whose sandals I am not worthy to untie. He will baptize you with <b>the Holy Spirit</b> and with fire.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Justification by faith is the correct teaching but the promise is for the gentiles AND the adherent of the law but they all must have faith, and pursuing the law as if by works is the problem, but pursuing the law by faith is ok.
</p>

<p>
I believe in-between is OK, so long as it is by faith.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Romans 7:22</b> - For I delight in the law of God, in my inner being, (ESV)

<p>
It's possible for Gentiles to keep Jewish commandments if they want (I think it's honorable) - but we are justified by faith in Jesus, not by being under the law:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Romans 2:25-29</b> - For circumcision indeed is of value if you obey the law, but if you break the law, your circumcision becomes uncircumcision. So, if a man who is uncircumcised keeps <span class="underline">the precepts of the law</span>, will not his uncircumcision be regarded as circumcision? Then he who is physically uncircumcised but keeps the law will condemn you who have the written code and circumcision but break the law. For no one is a Jew who is merely one outwardly, nor is circumcision outward and physical. But <span class="underline">a Jew is one inwardly, and circumcision is a matter of the heart, by the Spirit, not by the letter.</span> His praise is not from man but from God.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
It's possible to keep commandments by faith:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Romans 9:30-32</b> - What shall we say, then? That Gentiles who did not pursue righteousness have attained it, that is, a righteousness that is by faith; but that Israel who pursued a law that would lead to righteousness did not succeed in reaching that law. Why? Because they did not pursue it by faith, but as if it were based on works. They have stumbled over the stumbling stone, (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Romans 4:15-16</b> - For the law brings wrath, but where there is no law there is no transgression. That is why it depends on faith, in order that the promise may rest on grace and be guaranteed to all his offspring-not only to the adherent of the law but also to the one who shares the faith of Abraham, who is the father of us all, (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Matthew 5:17-25</b> - Do not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them. For truly, I say to you, until heaven and earth pass away, not an iota, not a dot, will pass from the Law until all is accomplished. Therefore whoever relaxes one of the least of these commandments and teaches others to do the same will be called least in the kingdom of heaven, but whoever does them and teaches them will be called great in the kingdom of heaven. For I tell you, unless your righteousness exceeds that of the scribes and Pharisees, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven. You have heard that it was said to those of old, You shall not murder; and whoever murders will be liable to judgment. But I say to you that everyone who is angry with his brother will be liable to judgment; whoever insults his brother will be liable to the council; and whoever says, You fool! will be liable to the hell of fire. So if you are offering your gift at the altar and there remember that your brother has something against you, leave your gift there before the altar and go. First be reconciled to your brother, and then come and offer your gift. Come to terms quickly with your accuser while you are going with him to court, lest your accuser hand you over to the judge, and the judge to the guard, and you be put in prison. (ESV)

I was born-again on 2 April 2022. On 1 April 2022 (one day before) I was wearing a pendant which on one side I had written 1023 which is decimal for the binary 1111111111 - which are ten ones. I was trying hard to follow the ten commandments <b>from the heart</b>, like Jesus teaches. I was doing this to seek Jesus. Then I was born-again. What a mystery.
</p>

<p>
Since then I've been trying to follow Jesus' commandments to get to know Him out of love for God, and because He has commanded His disciples to be fruitful for Him, and to abide in Him.

I had my belief in Jesus Christ and I had taken small steps of faith in remaining loyal to Jesus.

When a person is born-again of the Spirit, they receive the Spirit which helps them to stop sinning and it's really important to do so.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>1 Peter 1:23</b> - since you have been born again, not of perishable seed but of imperishable, through the living and abiding word of God; (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>1 John 5:18</b> - We know that everyone who has been born of God does not keep on sinning, but he who was born of God protects him, and the evil one does not touch him. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Ezekiel 11:19-20</b> - And I will give them one heart, and a new spirit I will put within them. I will remove the heart of stone from their flesh and give them a heart of flesh, that they may walk in my statutes and keep my rules and obey them. And they shall be my people, and I will be their God. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Jeremiah 32:40</b> - I will make with them an everlasting covenant, that I will not turn away from doing good to them. And I will put the fear of me in their hearts, that they may not turn from me. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>I John 3:9</b> - No one born of God makes a practice of sinning, for God's seed abides in him, and he cannot keep on sinning because he has been born of God.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
But I would much like my dream life to be like the following:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>John 5:19</b> - So Jesus said to them, Truly, truly, I say to you, the Son can do nothing of his own accord, but only what he sees the Father doing. For whatever the Father does, that the Son does likewise.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Whoever loves in the way Jesus loved us and the way Jesus commanded us has been born of God and knows God.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>I John 4:7</b> - Beloved, let us love one another, for love is from God, and whoever loves has been born of God and knows God.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Anyone who <b>truly believes</b>.
</p>

<p>
We must receive Jesus' words, walk in them and come to <b>know in truth</b> (we must truly know) that Jesus came from God.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>John 17:8</b> - For I have given them the words that you gave me, and they have received them and have <b>come to know in truth that I came from you</b>; and they have believed that you sent me.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Therefore, we should obey Jesus and arrive at the truth. Obedience is a part of faith. Like Abraham obeying God, or like Israel crossing through the Red Sea, it's obedience which leads to sure belief.
And the obedience doesn't end.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>John 8:31-32</b> - So Jesus was saying to those Jews who had believed Him, “If you <b>continue in My word</b>, then you are truly disciples of Mine; and <b>you will know the truth</b>, and the truth will make you free.” (NASB)
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>I John 5:1</b> - Everyone who believes that Jesus is the Christ has been born of God, and everyone who loves the Father loves whoever has been born of him.
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>I John 5:4</b> - For everyone who has been born of God overcomes the world. And this is the victory that has overcome the world-our faith.
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>I John 5:18</b> - We know that everyone who has been born of God does not keep on sinning, but he who was born of God protects him, and the evil one does not touch him.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
I feel like stopping sin is very important after being born again.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>John 5:14</b> - Afterward Jesus found him in the temple and said to him, See, you are well! Sin no more, that nothing worse may happen to you.

Justification by faith is the correct teaching but the promise is for the gentiles AND the adherent of the law but they all must have faith, and pursuing the law as if by works is the problem, but pursuing the law by faith is ok.
</p>

<p>

That Gentiles who did not pursue righteousness have attained it, that is, a righteousness that is by faith; but that Israel who pursued a law that would lead to righteousness did not succeed in reaching that law. Why? Because they did not pursue it by faith, but as if it were based on works. They have stumbled over the stumbling stone, (ESV)

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Romans 4:15-16</b> - For the law brings wrath, but where there is no law there is no transgression.

<h4 id="org01f7453"><span class="section-number-4">50.8.1.</span> God is the one who justifies</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-50-8-1">

<p>
<b>Romans 8:33</b> - Who shall bring any charge against God's elect? It is God who justifies.

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Romans 8:30</b> - And those whom he predestined he also called, and those whom he called he also justified, and those whom he justified he also glorified. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
But repentance is a work of the heart which is an act of faith.
I believe repentance is inseparable from faith because intrinsic to faith is belief and intrinsic to belief is metanoia (changing one's mind).
</p>

<p>
At it's most basic form repentance means a
person believes in Jesus as the Son of God and the Messiah who, being innocent, paid the
price for their sin through His broken body
and shed blood on the cross - a perfect and
eternal offering; that He died there but God
resurrected Him, and He is Lord of Heaven and
Earth, and has a <span class="underline">heart of obedience</span> to the will of God,
<span class="underline">wanting</span> to do the will of God, which involves their sanctification.
We must honour Jesus.
</p>

<p>
But I believe we are forgiven to forgive others. That must be part of the act of faith and the change of heart, I think.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Matthew 6:15</b> - but if you do not forgive others their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses. (ESV)

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-50-8-2">
<blockquote>
<p>
<b>James 2:10</b> - For whoever keeps the whole law but fails in one point has become accountable for all of it. For he who said, Do not commit adultery, also said, Do not murder. If you do not commit adultery but do murder, you have become a transgressor of the law. So speak and so act as those who are to be judged under the law of liberty. For judgment is without mercy to one who has shown no mercy. Mercy triumphs over judgment. What good is it, my brothers, if someone says he has faith but does not have works? Can that faith save him? If a brother or sister is poorly clothed and lacking in daily food, and one of you says to them, Go in peace, be warmed and filled, without giving them the things needed for the body, what good is that? So also faith by itself, if it does not have works, is dead. But someone will say, You have faith and I have works. Show me your faith apart from your works, and I will show you my faith by my works. You believe that God is one; you do well. Even the demons believe-and shudder! Do you want to be shown, you foolish person, that faith apart from works is useless? Was not Abraham our father justified by works when he offered up his son Isaac on the altar? You see that faith was active along with his works, and faith was completed by his works; and the Scripture was fulfilled that says, Abraham believed God, and it was counted to him as righteousness-and he was called a friend of God. You see that a person is justified by works and not by faith alone.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
I tend to agree with James on this.
Eliminating works from faith is not good.
</p>

<p>
Works:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>obedience</li>
<li>faithfulness
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>keeping God's commandments</li>
</ul></li>
<li>trust</li>
<li>fear of God</li>
<li>response of love
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>thankfulness</li>
<li>praise</li>
<li>forgiving others</li>
</ul></li>
<li>humility
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>keeping God's commandments</li>
</ul></li>
<li>patient endurance (time)</li>
</ul>

<p>
If a person believes that Jesus Christ is the Son of the Living God then they abide in Christ.
But do they <b>really</b> believe? Because if they don't <b>really</b> believe it deep down then but are lying to themself they may not abide in Christ at all.
How can a person believe without having a relationship with God? A relationship involves more than belief.
</p>

<p>
If a person does not have obedience, trust and
repentance from sin, but their faith has belief, then they only
abide in Jesus extremely precariously, and also that person's 'faith' probably wont receive much at all from God.

<p>
Justified through (G1223 dia) faith (G4102 <b>pistis</b>) in Christ (G5547 Christos) Jesus (G2424 Iesous).
Pistis is a strong word for faith that doesn't merely encapsulate belief, but it includes trust.
</p>

<p>
The greeks can turn the noun faith into the verb believing faith (G4100 pisteuo).
It's not the noun 'believe' as the root of the verb faith
</p>

<p>
<i><b>we have believed (G4100 pisteuo) in Christ</b></i> means we have <i><b>'faithed'</b></i> in Christ.
</p>

<p>
The 'believing faith' verb pisteuo has a root of faith (pistis).
</p>

<p>
Faith is a relationship with God.
Before Abraham believed God, he obeyed God.
Faith requires belief but it's more than belief.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>I Timothy 4:1</b>: But the Spirit (G4151 pneuma) explicitly says that in later times some will fall away from the faith (G4102 pistis), paying attention to deceitful spirits (G4151 pneuma) and doctrines of demons (G1140 daimonion), (NASB)
</p>

<p>
Faith is ongoing. Ongoing faith is patience endurance. Jesus says patience endurance is a work.
</p>

<blockquote>

<b>Revelation of John 2:19</b> - I know your works, your love and faith and service and patient endurance, and that your latter works exceed the first.

His divine power has granted to us all things that pertain to life and godliness, through the knowledge of him who called us to his own glory and excellence, by which he has granted to us his precious and very great promises, so that through them you may become partakers of the divine nature, having escaped from the corruption that is in the world because of sinful desire.

</blockquote>

<p>
It's totally worth following Jesus, doing good and proclaiming the gospel after getting born-again - following Jesus, even faithfully stopping sin, is the correct response,
for if being born-again is dying with Christ, and being given life by the life giving Spirit of Jesus,
we are partaking in the death and resurrection of Jesus, where Jesus had actually suffered for sins, the righteous for the unrighteous, so we too should continue living in a way that is turning away from sin.

<p>
Things make a bit more sense now:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Matthew 19:16-26</b> - And behold, a man came up to him, saying, Teacher, what good deed must I do to have eternal life? And he said to him, Why do you ask me about what is good? There is only one who is good. If you would enter life, keep the commandments. He said to him, Which ones? And Jesus said, You shall not murder, You shall not commit adultery, You shall not steal, You shall not bear false witness, Honor your father and mother, and, You shall love your neighbor as yourself. The young man said to him, All these I have kept. What do I still lack? Jesus said to him, If you would be perfect, go, sell what you possess and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; and come, follow me. When the young man heard this he went away sorrowful, for he had great possessions. And Jesus said to his disciples, Truly, I say to you, only with difficulty will a rich person enter the kingdom of heaven. Again I tell you, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich person to enter the kingdom of God. When the disciples heard this, they were greatly astonished, saying, Who then can be saved? But Jesus looked at them and said, With man this is impossible, but with God all things are possible.

Be accountable to God. Do not seek reward from others but from God. Focus on spiritual disciplines for the right reasons.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Matthew 6:1-18</b> - Beware of practicing your righteousness before other people in order to be seen by them, for then you will have no reward from your Father who is in heaven. Thus, when you give to the needy, sound no trumpet before you, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets, that they may be praised by others. Truly, I say to you, they have received their reward. But when you give to the needy, do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing, so that your giving may be in secret. And your Father who sees in secret will reward you. And when you pray, you must not be like the hypocrites. For they love to stand and pray in the synagogues and at the street corners, that they may be seen by others. Truly, I say to you, they have received their reward. But when you pray, go into your room and shut the door and pray to your Father who is in secret. And your Father who sees in secret will reward you. And when you pray, do not heap up empty phrases as the Gentiles do, for they think that they will be heard for their many words. Do not be like them, for your Father knows what you need before you ask him. Pray then like this: Our Father in heaven, hallowed be your name. Your kingdom come, your will be done, on earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread, and forgive us our debts, as we also have forgiven our debtors. And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. For if you forgive others their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you, but if you do not forgive others their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses. And when you fast, do not look gloomy like the hypocrites, for they disfigure their faces that their fasting may be seen by others. Truly, I say to you, they have received their reward. But when you fast, anoint your head and wash your face, that your fasting may not be seen by others but by your Father who is in secret. And your Father who sees in secret will reward you. (ESV)
</p>

<p>
Have a relationship with God:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Hebrews 11:6</b> - And without faith it is impossible to please him, for whoever would draw near to God must believe that he exists and that he rewards those who seek him. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Seek heavenly reward, not earthly reward. Have a heart seeking reward from God and not from man. Have your heart in heaven, not in earth:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Matthew 6:19-21</b> - Do not lay up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moth and rust destroy and where thieves break in and steal, but lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust destroys and where thieves do not break in and steal. For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Seek God's kingdom and His righteousness first of all:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Matthew 6:33</b> - But seek first the kingdom of God and his righteousness, and all these things will be added to you. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Do not worry about tomorrow:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Matthew 6:34</b> - Therefore do not be anxious about tomorrow, for tomorrow will be anxious for itself. Sufficient for the day is its own trouble. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Use right judgment. We should be examining, judging, cleaning ourselves up, taking a look in the mirror first (by God's standards) before judging others:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Matthew 7:1-5</b> - Judge not, that you be not judged. For with the judgment you pronounce you will be judged, and with the measure you use it will be measured to you. Why do you see the speck that is in your brother's eye, but do not notice the log that is in your own eye? Or how can you say to your brother, Let me take the speck out of your eye, when there is the log in your own eye? You hypocrite, first take the log out of your own eye, and then you will see clearly to take the speck out of your brother's eye. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Practice discretion:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Matthew 7:6</b> - Do not give dogs what is holy, and do not throw your pearls before pigs, lest they trample them underfoot and turn to attack you. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Ask, seek, and knock:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Matthew 7:7-8</b> - Ask, and it will be given to you; seek, and you will find; knock, and it will be opened to you. For everyone who asks receives, and the one who seeks finds, and to the one who knocks it will be opened. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Ask God for your needs, which includes asking God for <b>the Holy Spirit</b>:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Luke 11:1-11</b> - Now Jesus was praying in a certain place, and when he finished, one of his disciples said to him, Lord, teach us to pray, as John taught his disciples. And he said to them, When you pray, say: Father, hallowed be your name. Your kingdom come. Give us each day our daily bread, and forgive us our sins, for we ourselves forgive everyone who is indebted to us. And lead us not into temptation. And he said to them, Which of you who has a friend will go to him at midnight and say to him, Friend, lend me three loaves, for a friend of mine has arrived on a journey, and I have nothing to set before him; and he will answer from within, Do not bother me; the door is now shut, and my children are with me in bed. I cannot get up and give you anything? I tell you, though he will not get up and give him anything because he is his friend, yet because of his impudence he will rise and give him whatever he needs. And I tell you, ask, and it will be given to you; <b>seek, and you will find</b>; knock, and it will be opened to you. For <b>everyone who asks receives</b>, and <b>the one who seeks finds</b>, and to <b>the one who knocks it will be opened</b>. What father among you, if his son asks for a fish, will instead of a fish give him a serpent; (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Treat others as you would like to be treated:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Matthew 7:12</b> - So whatever you wish that others would do to you, do also to them, for this is the Law and the Prophets. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Choose the narrow path to life:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Matthew 7:13-14</b> - Enter by the narrow gate. For the gate is wide and the way is easy that leads to destruction, and those who enter by it are many. For the gate is narrow and the way is hard that leads to life, and those who find it are few. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Look out for false prophets:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Matthew 7:15-20</b> - Beware of false prophets, who come to you in sheep's clothing but inwardly are ravenous wolves. You will recognize them by their fruits. Are grapes gathered from thornbushes, or figs from thistles? So, every healthy tree bears good fruit, but the diseased tree bears bad fruit. A healthy tree cannot bear bad fruit, nor can a diseased tree bear good fruit. Every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire. Thus you will recognize them by their fruits. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Pray for kingdom laborers. Pray that God sends out kingdom laborers:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Matthew 9:37-38</b> - Then he said to his disciples, The harvest is plentiful, but the laborers are few; therefore pray earnestly to the Lord of the harvest to send out laborers into his harvest. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Be on your guard. Jesus sends us out to be like scapegoats. Be wise and remain blameless:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Matthew 10:16-17</b> - Behold, I am sending you out as <b>sheep in the midst of wolves</b>, so be wise as serpents and <b>innocent as doves</b>. Beware of men, for they will deliver you over to courts and flog you in their synagogues, (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Do not fear persecutors. Fear God. But put your trust in God because He takes care of those who fear Him. Speak the truth:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Matthew 10:26-31</b> - So have no fear of them, for nothing is covered that will not be revealed, or hidden that will not be known. What I tell you in the dark, say in the light, and what you hear whispered, proclaim on the housetops. And do not fear those who kill the body but cannot kill the soul. Rather fear him who can destroy both soul and body in hell. Are not two sparrows sold for a penny? And not one of them will fall to the ground apart from your Father. But even the hairs of your head are all numbered. Fear not, therefore; you are of more value than many sparrows. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Take Jesus' yoke upon yourself:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Matthew 11:28-30</b> - Come to me, all who labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you, and learn from me, for I am gentle and lowly in heart, and you will find rest for your souls. For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Do not despise the little ones:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Matthew 18:10</b> - See that you do not despise one of these little ones. For I tell you that in heaven their angels always see the face of my Father who is in heaven. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
How to deal with offenders:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Matthew 18:15-17</b> - If your brother sins against you, go and tell him his fault, between you and him alone. If he listens to you, you have gained your brother. But if he does not listen, take one or two others along with you, that every charge may be established by the evidence of two or three witnesses. If he refuses to listen to them, tell it to the church. And if he refuses to listen even to the church, let him be to you as a Gentile and a tax collector. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Forgive extremely generously / almost without limits:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Matthew 18:21-22</b> - Then Peter came up and said to him, Lord, how often will my brother sin against me, and I forgive him? As many as seven times? Jesus said to him, I do not say to you seven times, but seventy times seven. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Lead through service:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Matthew 20:25-28</b> - But Jesus called them to him and said, You know that the rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them, and their great ones exercise authority over them. It shall not be so among you. But whoever would be great among you must be your servant, and whoever would be first among you must be your slave, even as the Son of Man came not to be served but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Love God with all your heart, mind, and soul:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Matthew 22:37-38</b> - And he said to him, You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind. This is the great and first commandment. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Love your neighbor as yourself - fulfill the requirement of the law:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Matthew 22:39</b> - And a second is like it: You shall love your neighbor as yourself. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Stay alert and keep watch:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Matthew 24:42-44</b> - Therefore, stay awake, for you do not know on what day your Lord is coming. But know this, that if the master of the house had known in what part of the night the thief was coming, he would have stayed awake and would not have let his house be broken into. Therefore you also must be ready, for the Son of Man is coming at an hour you do not expect. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Make disciples of all the nations, teaching them to obey Jesus:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Matthew 28:18-20</b> - And Jesus came and said to them, All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me. Go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of <b>the Holy Spirit</b>, teaching them to observe all that I have commanded you. And behold, I am with you always, to the end of the age. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Deny yourself daily, and follow Jesus:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Luke 9:23-24</b> - And he said to all, If anyone would come after me, let him deny himself and take up his cross daily and follow me. For whoever would save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for my sake will save it. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Do not covet your possessions:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Luke 12:15</b> - And he said to them, Take care, and be on your guard against all covetousness, for one's life does not consist in the abundance of his possessions. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Give to those who can't reciprocate:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Luke 14:12-14</b> - He said also to the man who had invited him, When you give a dinner or a banquet, do not invite your friends or your brothers or your relatives or rich neighbors, lest they also invite you in return and you be repaid. But when you give a feast, invite the poor, the crippled, the lame, the blind, and you will be blessed, because they cannot repay you. You will be repaid at the resurrection of the just. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
You must be born again:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>John 3:7</b> - Do not marvel that I said to you, You must be born again. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
If you love Jesus, keep His commandments. The one who keeps Jesus' commandments is the one who loves Jesus:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>John 14:15</b> - If you love me, you will keep my commandments.
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>John 14:21</b> - Whoever has my commandments and keeps them, he it is who loves me. And he who loves me will be loved by my Father, and I will love him and manifest myself to him.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Those who have testimony of Jesus should preach testify that he is the one appointed by God to be judge of the living and the dead:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Acts 10:41-44</b> - not to all the people but to us who had been chosen by God as witnesses, who ate and drank with him after he rose from the dead. And he commanded us to preach to the people and to testify that he is the one appointed by God to be judge of the living and the dead. To him all the prophets bear witness that everyone who believes in him receives forgiveness of sins through his name. While Peter was still saying these things, <b>the Holy Spirit</b> fell on all who heard the word. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Acts 13:47</b> - For so the Lord has commanded us, saying, I have made you a light for the Gentiles, that you may bring salvation to the ends of the earth.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Those who proclaim the gospel should get their living by the gospel:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>I Corinthians 9:14</b> - In the same way, the Lord commanded that those who proclaim the gospel should get their living by the gospel.
</p>

I believe that here on earth, God wants us to choose Jesus. But from God's perspective, who knows how it works.
</p>

<p>
God can raise up children from anyone who has repentance and may grant being a child of Abraham to anyone who walks in the footsteps of the faith that Abraham had before he was circumcised.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Luke 3:8</b> - <span class="underline">Bear fruits in keeping with repentance.</span> And do not begin to say to yourselves, We have Abraham as our father. For I tell you, <span class="underline">God is able from these stones to raise up children for Abraham.</span>
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Romans 4:9-12</b> - Is this blessing then only for the circumcised, or also for the uncircumcised? We say that faith was counted to Abraham as righteousness. How then was it counted to him? Was it before or after he had been circumcised? It was not after, but before he was circumcised. He received the sign of circumcision as a seal of the righteousness that he had by faith while he was still uncircumcised. The purpose was to make him the father of all who believe without being circumcised, so that righteousness would be counted to them as well, and to make him the father of the circumcised who are <span class="underline">not merely circumcised but who also walk in the footsteps of the faith that our father Abraham had before he was circumcised</span>.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
We do have the ability to make choices:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Isaiah 66:3</b> - He who slaughters an ox is like one who kills a man; he who sacrifices a lamb, like one who breaks a dog's neck; he who presents a grain offering, like one who offers pig's blood; he who makes a memorial offering of frankincense, like one who blesses an idol. These have chosen their own ways, and their soul delights in their abominations; (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
A gift can be accepted or rejected - and this is a choice we <span class="underline">can</span> make:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Romans 5:17</b> - If, because of one man's trespass, death reigned through that one man, much more will those who receive the abundance of grace and the free gift of righteousness reign in life through the one man Jesus Christ. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Even the elect need help to obtain the salvation that is in Christ Jesus with eternal glory:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>II Timothy 2:10</b> - Therefore I endure everything for the sake of the elect, that they also may obtain the salvation that is in Christ Jesus with eternal glory. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
We should not lean on our own understanding:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Isaiah 55:9</b> - For as the heavens are higher than the earth, so are my ways higher than your ways and my thoughts than your thoughts.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
What we should do now is acknowledge the LORD, keep our eyes on Jesus, and live godly lives:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Proverbs 3:5-6</b> - Trust in the LORD with all your heart, and do not lean on your own understanding. In all your ways acknowledge him, and he will make straight your paths. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Focusing on predestination, election etc. without obeying what Jesus said to do, is not really obeying the will of God and <b>may</b> put a person in this category:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>2 Thessalonians 2:11-13</b> - Therefore God sends them a strong delusion, so that they may believe what is false, in order that all may be condemned who did not believe the truth but had pleasure in unrighteousness.  But we ought always to give thanks to God for you, brothers beloved by the Lord, because God chose you as the firstfruits to be saved, through sanctification by the Spirit and belief in the truth.  (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Although God chooses who He has mercy on, we should still have a godly and humble response to God's mercy:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Romans 9:10-16</b> - And not only so, but also when Rebecca had conceived children by one man, our forefather Isaac, though they were not yet born and had done nothing either good or bad—in order that God's purpose of election might continue, not because of works but because of his call— she was told, The older will serve the younger. As it is written, Jacob I loved, but Esau I hated. What shall we say then? Is there injustice on God's part? By no means! For he says to Moses, I will have mercy on whom I have mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I have compassion. So then it depends not on human will or exertion, but on God, who has mercy.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
We should be confident that God will continue to take care of us:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Romans 8:29-39</b>- For those whom he foreknew he also predestined to be conformed to the image of his Son, in order that he might be the firstborn among many brothers. And those whom he predestined he also called, and those whom he called he also justified, and those whom he justified he also glorified. What then shall we say to these things? If God is for us, who can be against us? He who did not spare his own Son but gave him up for us all, how will he not also with him graciously give us all things? Who shall bring any charge against God's elect? It is God who justifies. Who is to condemn? Christ Jesus is the one who died—more than that, who was raised—who is at the right hand of God, who indeed is interceding for us. Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? Shall tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or danger, or sword? As it is written, For your sake we are being killed all the day long; we are regarded as sheep to be slaughtered. No, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him who loved us. For I am sure that neither death nor life, nor angels nor rulers, nor things present nor things to come, nor powers, nor height nor depth, nor anything else in all creation, will be able to separate us from the love of God in Christ Jesus our Lord.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
God has good plans for us and we should submit to His wisdom, and obey Him:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Isaiah 64:8</b> - But now, O Lord, you are our Father; we are the clay, and you are our potter; we are all the work of your hand.
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Romans 8:28</b> - And we know that <span class="underline">for those who love God</span> <span class="underline">all things work together for good</span>, <span class="underline">for those who are called according to his purpose</span>.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Who chooses who? I believe Jesus chose me and I also choose Jesus every day but <span class="underline">Jesus chose me first</span>:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>John 15:16</b> - You did not choose me, but I chose you and appointed you that you should go and bear fruit and that your fruit should abide, so that whatever you ask the Father in my name, he may give it to you. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Romans 8:29</b> - For those whom he foreknew he also predestined to be conformed to the image of his Son, in order that he might be the firstborn among many brothers.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
God is the Creator, our Maker.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>For those who love God
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>obedient to God</li>
</ul></li>
<li>For those who are called according to His purpose</li>
<li>All things work together for good</li>
</ul>

<p>
God's ultimately the one in control of us but from our perspective we must submit to His righteousness and His will and be obedient.
</p>

<p>
To <span class="underline">make election sure</span>, and <b>to not fail</b>, one must practice personal righteousness and put a stop to sin.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>II Peter 1:10-11</b> - Therefore, brothers, be all the more diligent to make your calling and election sure, for if you practice these qualities you will never fall. For in this way there will be richly provided for you an entrance into the eternal kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Acts 13:14-16</b> - but they went on from Perga and came to Antioch in Pisidia.  And on the Sabbath day they went into the synagogue and sat down.  After the reading from the Law and the Prophets, the rulers of the synagogue sent a message to them, saying, Brothers, if you have any word of exhortation for the people, say it.  So Paul stood up, and motioning with his hand said: Men of Israel and <b>you who fear God</b>, listen.  (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The elect fear God
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>They had soft hearts
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>able to believe and obey</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>The non-elect <b>judge themselves</b> unworthy of eternal life
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>They had hard hearts
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>unable to believe and obey</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>
One thing is for sure. The elect do not have hard hearts.
So I'd say if a person's heart is not totally hard, then soften it.
</p>

<p>
A heart not easy to be moved with virtuous affections:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><b>Deuteronomy 15:7</b> - If among you, one of your brothers should become poor, in any of your towns within your land that the Lord your God is giving you, you shall not harden your heart or shut your hand against your poor brother, (ESV)</li>
<li><b>Mark 3:4-5</b> - And He said to them, “Is it lawful to do good or to do harm on the Sabbath, to save a life or to kill?” But they kept silent. After looking around at them with anger, grieved at their hardness of heart, He said to the man, “Stretch out your hand.” And he stretched it out, and his hand was restored. (ESV)</li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaMVzW9yiBc">Do I Have a Hard Heart? - YouTube</a></li>
<li><b>Mark 8:17</b> - And Jesus, aware of this, said to them, Why are you discussing the fact that you have no bread? Do you not yet perceive or understand? Are your hearts hardened? (ESV)</li>
<li><b>II Chronicles 36:12-13</b> - He did what was evil in the sight of the Lord his God. He did not humble himself before Jeremiah the prophet, who spoke from the mouth of the Lord. He also rebelled against King Nebuchadnezzar, who had made him swear by God. He stiffened his neck and hardened his heart against turning to the Lord, the God of Israel. (ESV)</li>
<li><b>Romans 2:4</b> - Or do you presume on the riches of his kindness and forbearance and patience, not knowing that God's kindness is meant to lead you to repentance? (ESV)</li>
<li><b>Zechariah 7:12</b> - They made their hearts diamond-hard lest they should hear the law and the words that the Lord of hosts had sent by his Spirit through the former prophets. Therefore great anger came from the Lord of hosts. (ESV)</li>
</ul>

<p>
If we have a hard heart, we should ask for a new one:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><b>Ezekiel 36:26</b> - And I will give you a new heart, and a new spirit I will put within you. And I will remove the heart of stone from your flesh and give you a heart of flesh.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Don't let your heart go hard - find a community of encouraging believers:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><b>Hebrews 3:13</b> - But exhort one another every day, as long as it is called today, that none of you may be hardened by the deceitfulness of sin.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Acts 13:46-48</b> - And Paul and Barnabas spoke out boldly, saying, It was necessary that the word of God be spoken first to you.  Since you thrust it aside and <b>judge yourselves unworthy</b> of eternal life, behold, we are turning to the Gentiles.  For so the Lord has commanded us, saying, I have made you a light for the Gentiles, that you may bring salvation to the ends of the earth.  And when the Gentiles heard this, they began rejoicing and glorifying the word of the Lord, and as many as were appointed to eternal life believed. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
I do believe, however, that <b>cooperation</b> is generally required on the part of the believer:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Before regeneration, and</li>
<li>After regeneration</li>
</ul>

<p>
Before regeneration, I was trying hard to repent of my sin by trying to obey the 10 commandments <b>from the heart</b>.
And I would say I was also making progress.
After regeneration, I had to learn to walk in Jesus' commandments, and to submit to His righteousness.
</p>

<p>
To be sanctified by faith in Jesus is an applied process, I think:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Acts 26:18</b> - to open their eyes, so that they may turn from darkness to light and from the power of Satan to God, that they may receive forgiveness of sins and a place among those who are <b>sanctified by faith in me</b>. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
In similar fashion to Jesus continually obeying Father God as he endured suffering, I think we should learn to submit and follow Jesus' commandments
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Hebrews 5:7-10</b> - In the days of his flesh, Jesus offered up prayers and supplications, with loud cries and tears, to him who was able to save him from death, and he was heard because of his reverence. <span class="underline">Although he was a son, he learned obedience through what he suffered.</span> And being made perfect, he became the source of eternal salvation to all who obey him, being designated by God a high priest after the order of Melchizedek.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
I believe that after being <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220402091720/https://mullikine.github.io/posts/astral-projection/">born-again of the spirit</a>, I had (with very little knowledge of Jesus' commandments) had to learn Jesus' commandments and apply them, and I believe <b>the Holy Spirit</b> taught me to obey Jesus as I read Jesus' sayings and was subsequently tested on those sayings. For example, if I read that we must give to all who ask, and then the Lord sets up a situation where someone asks for money, then I have a choice to obey Jesus, which means resisting those who try to deter me from obeying Jesus. Upon being tested, someone would offer worldly wisdom in an attempt to deter me from following Jesus, and as I obey God I am led by <b>the Holy Spirit</b>, and taught by <b>the Holy Spirit</b>. And this is an ongoing process. I say this for others' sake to explain how I have come to know how faith in Jesus, following Jesus, works practically, that it is more than mere intellectual belief to be led by the Spirit, but it is also obedience, and a process of sanctification, and walking in the light.
</p>

<p>
So I was born-again of the Spirit and when that happened I was given some very strong faith/knowledge that God exists, but I still had to seek Jesus because the Bible says that anyone who
claims to know Jesus but doesn't walk in His commandments is not telling the truth, and I want to come to know Jesus.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>I John 2:4</b> - Whoever says I know him but does not keep his commandments is a liar, and the truth is not in him,
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
John the Baptist taught repentance and love for one's neighbour before receiving the baptisim of <b>the Holy Spirit</b>:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Luke 3:3-8</b> - And he went into all the region around the Jordan, proclaiming a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins. As it is written in the book of the words of Isaiah the prophet, The voice of one crying in the wilderness: Prepare the way of the Lord, make his paths straight. Every valley shall be filled, and every mountain and hill shall be made low, and the crooked shall become straight, and the rough places shall become level ways, and all flesh shall see the salvation of God. He said therefore to the crowds that came out to be baptized by him, You brood of vipers! Who warned you to flee from the wrath to come? <span class="underline">Bear fruits in keeping with repentance</span>. And do not begin to say to yourselves, We have Abraham as our father. For I tell you, <span class="underline">God is able from these stones to raise up children for Abraham.</span>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Regeneration is the sovereign work of <b>the Holy Spirit</b>, though. AMEN!! Nevertheless, I believe in allowing Jesus Christ to be my Lord.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>John 3:5-8</b> - Jesus answered, Truly, truly, I say to you, unless one is born of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter the kingdom of God. That which is born of the flesh is flesh, and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit. Do not marvel that I said to you, You must be born again. The wind blows where it wishes, and you hear its sound, but you do not know where it comes from or where it goes. So it is with everyone who is born of the Spirit.
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>John 6:45-47</b> - It is written in the Prophets, And they will all be taught by God. <span class="underline">Everyone who has heard and learned from the Father comes to me</span> — not that anyone has seen the Father except he who is from God; he has seen the Father. Truly, truly, I say to you, whoever believes (G4100 <b>pisteuo</b>) has eternal life.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Also, I believe that this is what God actually wants from us - to seek Him and worship Him of our own volition.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Romans 11:7-10</b> - What then? Israel failed to obtain what it was seeking. The <b>elect</b> obtained it, but <b>the rest were hardened</b>, as it is written, God gave them a spirit of stupor, eyes that would not see and ears that would not hear, down to this very day.  And David says, Let their table become a snare and a trap, a stumbling block and a retribution for them; let their eyes be darkened so that they cannot see, and bend their backs forever.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The Gentiles should not harden their own hearts. Neither should the Jews.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Psalms 95:8</b> - do not harden your hearts, as at Meribah, as on the day at Massah in the wilderness,
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Hebrews 3:8</b> - do not harden your hearts as in the rebellion, on the day of testing in the wilderness,
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Hebrews 3:15</b> - As it is said, Today, if you hear his voice, do not harden your hearts as in the rebellion.
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Hebrews 4:7</b> - again he appoints a certain day, Today, saying through David so long afterward, in the words already quoted, <b>Today, if you hear his voice, do not harden your hearts</b>.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
God puts the fear of Him into the elect's heart.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Jeremiah 32:40</b> - I will make with them an everlasting covenant, that I will not turn away from doing good to them. And I will put the fear of me in their hearts, that they may not turn from me. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
I still think there is co-operation by the believer before and after spiritual regeneration.
</p>

<p>
Having heard the truth, the Spirit sanctifies us through our obedience to the Spirit, and are we are conformed to holiness, not to impurity:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>I Peter 1:14-16</b> - As obedient children, do not be conformed to the passions of your former ignorance, but as he who called you is holy, you also be holy in all your conduct, since it is written, You shall be holy, for I am holy.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
We purify ourselves as we have faith in Jesus:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>I John 3:3</b> - And everyone who thus hopes in him purifies himself as he is pure.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Having purified ourselves by obedience to the truth:
</p>

<p>
This here says we must obey for the sake of purification of our souls even after being born-again:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>I Peter 1:22-23</b> - Having purified your souls by your obedience to the truth for a sincere brotherly love, love one another earnestly from a pure heart, since you have been born again, not of perishable seed but of imperishable, through the living and abiding word of God;
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
And Jesus instructs us to have an obedient heart if we want to know that Jesus' teaching is from God:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>John 7:17</b> - If anyone's will is to do God's will, he will know whether the teaching is from God or whether I am speaking on my own authority.  (ESV)

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Genesis 15:1-6</b> - After these things the word of the Lord came to Abram in a vision: Fear not, Abram, I am your shield; your reward shall be very great. But Abram said, O Lord God, what will you give me, for I continue childless, and the heir of my house is Eliezer of Damascus? And Abram said, Behold, you have given me no offspring, and a member of my household will be my heir. And behold, the word of the Lord came to him: This man shall not be your heir; your very own son shall be your heir.

In the fullness of time, all things in heaven and earth are united to God:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Ephesians 1:10</b> - as a plan for the fullness of time, to unite all things in him, things in heaven and things on earth.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Given that we have an inheritance, it's evident that God must have predestined us:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Ephesians 1:11-14</b> - In him we have obtained an inheritance, having been predestined according to the purpose of him who works all things according to the counsel of his will, so that we who were the first to hope in Christ might be to the praise of his glory. In him you also, when you heard the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation, and believed in him, were sealed with the promised Holy Spirit, who is the guarantee of our inheritance until we acquire possession of it, to the praise of his glory.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The inheritance is salvation:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Hebrews 1:14</b> - Are they not all ministering spirits sent out to serve for the sake of those who are to inherit salvation? (ESV)

</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The man had faith - faith enters into the truth / receives from God:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Acts 3:5-8</b> - And he began to give them his attention, <span class="underline">expecting to receive something from them</span>. But Peter said, “I do not possess silver and gold, but what I do have I give to you: In the name of Jesus Christ the Nazarene&#x2013; walk!” And seizing him by the right hand, he raised him up; and immediately his feet and his ankles were strengthened. With a leap he stood upright and began to walk; and he entered the temple with them, walking and leaping and praising God.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Jesus made the man walk through Jesus' power and Jesus' holiness:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Acts 3:11-12</b> - While he was clinging to Peter and John, all the people ran together to them at the so-called portico of Solomon, full of amazement. But when Peter saw this, he replied to the people, “Men of Israel, why are you amazed at this, or <span class="underline">why do you gaze at us, as if by our own power or piety we had made him walk</span>?
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The faith which He had in Jesus' name is what healed him:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Acts 3:16</b> - And on the basis of faith in His name, it is <span class="underline">the name of Jesus which has strengthened this man whom you see and know</span>; and <span class="underline">the faith which comes through Him has given him this perfect health</span> in the presence of you all.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
There are other instances of this - it's faith in Jesus which makes a person well and receives forgiveness and salvation from Jesus:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Mark 5:34</b> -  And he said to her, Daughter, your faith has made you well; go in peace, and be healed of your disease.  (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Luke 7:47-50</b> - Therefore I tell you, her sins, which are many, are forgiven-for she loved much. But he who is forgiven little, loves little. And he said to her, Your sins are forgiven. Then those who were at table with him began to say among themselves, Who is this, who even forgives sins? And he said to the woman, Your faith has saved you; go in peace. (ESV)

For his invisible attributes, namely, his eternal power and divine nature, have been clearly perceived, ever since the creation of the world, in the things that have been made.

Claiming to be wise, they became fools, and exchanged the glory of the immortal God for images resembling mortal man and birds and animals and reptiles. Therefore God gave them up in the lusts of their hearts to impurity, to the dishonoring of their bodies among themselves, because they exchanged the truth about God for a lie and worshiped and served the creature rather than the Creator, who is blessed forever!

For the day of judgement, we must seek to:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>abide in His love</li>
<li>be loving as He loves</li>
</ul>

<p>
We should be like Jesus while we are in this world:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>I John 4:16-17</b> - So <span class="underline">we have come to know</span> and to believe <span class="underline">the love that God has for us</span>. God is love, and <span class="underline">whoever abides in love abides in God, and God abides in him.</span> By this is <span class="underline">love perfected with us</span>, so that we may have confidence for the day of judgment, because <span class="underline">as he is so also are we in this world.</span> (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Abide in His love:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>I John 4:10</b> - In this is love, not that we have loved God but <span class="underline">that he loved us and sent his Son to be the propitiation for our sins.</span>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Be loving as He loves:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>II John 1:4-6</b> - I rejoiced greatly to find some of your children walking in the truth, just as we were commanded by the Father. And now I ask you, dear lady—not as though I were writing you a new commandment, but the one we have had from the beginning—that we <span class="underline">love one another</span>. And <b>this is love</b>, <span class="underline">that we walk according to his commandments</span>; this is the commandment, just as you have heard from the beginning, so that you should walk in it.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
There are those who have faith, and those who betray. Betrayal is counter to having faith. Faith includes belief, obedience and faithfulness:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>John 6:63-65</b> - It is <span class="underline">the Spirit who gives life</span>; the flesh is of no avail. <span class="underline">The words that I have spoken to you are spirit and life.</span> But there are some of you who do not believe. (For Jesus knew from the beginning who those were who did not believe, and who it was who would betray him. ) And He was saying, “For this reason I have said to you, that no one can come to Me unless it has been granted him from the Father.”

I came from the Father and have come into the world, and now I am leaving the world and going to the Father. His disciples said, Ah, now you are speaking plainly and not using figurative speech! Now we know that you know all things and do not need anyone to question you; this is why we believe that you came from God. Jesus answered them, Do you now believe? Behold, the hour is coming, indeed it has come, when you will be scattered, each to his own home, and will leave me alone. Yet I am not alone, for the Father is with me.

So put into practice Jesus Christ's commandments, and line up your will line up with God's will:
</p>

<p>
<b>I John 5:14-15</b> - And this is the confidence that we have toward him, that if we ask anything according to his will he hears us. And if we know that he hears us in whatever we ask, we know that we have the requests that we have asked of him.

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>III John 1:11</b> - Beloved, do not imitate evil but imitate good. Whoever does good is from God; whoever does evil has not seen God.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
We must be imitators of Christ Jesus. See what Paul is doing as an example of imitating Christ:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Philippians 3:12-21</b> - Not that I have already obtained this or am already perfect, but I press on to make it my own, because Christ Jesus has made me his own. Brothers, I do not consider that I have made it my own. But one thing I do: forgetting what lies behind and straining forward to what lies ahead, I press on toward the goal for the prize of the upward call of God in Christ Jesus. Let those of us who are mature think this way, and if in anything you think otherwise, God will reveal that also to you. Only let us hold true to what we have attained. Brothers, join in imitating me, and keep your eyes on those who walk according to the example you have in us. For many, of whom I have often told you and now tell you even with tears, walk as enemies of the cross of Christ. Their end is destruction, their god is their belly, and they glory in their shame, with minds set on earthly things. But our citizenship is in heaven, and from it we await a Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ, who will transform our lowly body to be like his glorious body, by the power that enables him even to subject all things to himself. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
If we love one another [as He loved us]:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>I John 4:12</b> - No one has ever seen God; if we love one another, God abides in us and his love is perfected in us.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
We must be drawn to Jesus Christ, who is the bread of life. We do the will of God and Jesus Christ will raise us on the last day:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>John 6:44-48</b> - No one can come to me unless the Father who sent me draws him. And I will raise him up on the last day. It is written in the Prophets, And they will all be taught by God. Everyone who has heard and learned from the Father comes to me— not that anyone has seen the Father except he who is from God; he has seen the Father. Truly, truly, I say to you, whoever believes has eternal life. I am the bread of life.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
We must have faith in Jesus Christ and the words He has spoken:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>John 6:57-58</b> - As the living Father sent me, and I live because of the Father, so whoever feeds on me, he also will live because of me. This is the bread that came down from heaven, not as the fathers ate and died. Whoever feeds on this bread will live forever.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Don't betray Jesus. Continue walking with Jesus:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>John 6:63-69</b> - It is the Spirit who gives life; the flesh is of no avail. The words that I have spoken to you are spirit and life. But there are some of you who do not believe. (For Jesus knew from the beginning who those were who did not believe, and who it was who would betray him. ) And He was saying, “For this reason I have said to you, that no one can come to Me unless it has been granted him from the Father.” After this many of his disciples turned back and no longer walked with him. So Jesus said to the Twelve, Do you want to go away as well? Simon Peter answered him, Lord, to whom shall we go? You have the words of eternal life, and we have believed, and have come to know, that you are the Holy One of God.

</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
In the following case, I think that obedience would have come before belief as if the disciples had loved Him then they would have rejoiced, but that Jesus explains things in advance so that we will believe when we see. Jesus tells us in advance that He goes to the Father, and will come to us, so that we will believe:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>John 14:27-29</b> - Peace I leave with you; my peace I give to you. Not as the world gives do I give to you. Let not your hearts be troubled, neither let them be afraid. You heard me say to you, I am going away, and I will come to you. If you loved me, you would have rejoiced, because I am going to the Father, for the Father is greater than I. And now I have told you before it takes place, so that when it does take place you may believe.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Faith is a lifestyle. It's walking in the truth:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>II John 1:4-6</b> - I was very glad to find some of your children walking in truth, just as we have received commandment to do from the Father. And now I ask you, dear lady—not as though I were writing you a new commandment, but the one we have had from the beginning—that we love one another.

<p>
This quite clearly shows that Jesus Christ is Almighty God:

<p>
Jesus abides in the Father (and is in the bosom of the Father):

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>John 1:18</b> - No one has seen God at any time; the only begotten God who is in the bosom of the Father, He has explained Him. (NASB)

Jesus Christ is at the Father's side (and has made Father God known):
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>John 1:18</b> - No one has ever seen God; the only God, who is at the Father's side, he has made him known. (ESV)

</blockquote>

<p>
This says the Word was God. We can be sure that in the beginning there was the Word and the Word was with God and the Word was God, and that Jesus Christ is the Word:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>John 1:1</b> - In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. (ESV, NASB, KJV, BSB)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
In Christ the Godhead is present: simply, it means that in human nature/form of Jesus, that entails the human flesh/body, there dwells the entirety of divine perfection:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Colossians 2:9-15</b> - For <b>in him the whole fullness of deity dwells bodily</b>, and you have been filled in him, who is the head of all rule and authority. In him also you were circumcised with a circumcision made without hands, by putting off the body of the flesh, by the circumcision of Christ, having been buried with him in baptism, in which you were also raised with him through faith in the powerful working of God, who raised him from the dead. And you, who were dead in your trespasses and the uncircumcision of your flesh, God made alive together with him, having forgiven us all our trespasses, by canceling the record of debt that stood against us with its legal demands. This he set aside, nailing it to the cross. He disarmed the rulers and authorities and put them to open shame, by triumphing over them in him.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The Word actually <b>became</b> flesh:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>John 1:14</b> - And <b>the Word became flesh and dwelt among us</b>, and we have seen his glory, glory as of the only Son from the Father, full of grace and truth. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Luke 24:39</b> - See my hands and my feet, that it is I myself. Touch me, and see. For a spirit does not have flesh and bones as you see that I have. (ESV)

</blockquote>

<p>
Thomas saw God in Jesus Christ, or Jesus Christ as God:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>John 20:28</b> - Thomas answered him, My Lord and my God! (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
It's very clear that there is some distinction between Father and Son:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>John 20:17</b> - Jesus said to her, Do not cling to me, for I have not yet ascended to the Father; but go to my brothers and say to them, I am ascending to my Father and your Father, to my God and your God. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
But Jesus Christ is our Mediator:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>I Timothy 2:5</b> - For there is one God, and there is one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus, (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Jesus still refers to Father God as His God:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Revelation of John 3:12</b> - The one who conquers, I will make him a pillar in the temple of my God. Never shall he go out of it, and I will write on him the name of my God, and the name of the city of my God, the new Jerusalem, which comes down from my God out of heaven, and my own new name. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
I think this really clears things up a little bit:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Revelation of John 3:21</b> - The one who conquers, I will grant him to sit with me on my throne, as I also conquered and sat down with my Father on his throne. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>John 16:32</b> - Behold, the hour is coming, indeed it has come, when you will be scattered, each to his own home, and will leave me alone. Yet I am not alone, for <span class="underline">the Father is with me.</span> (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Jesus came in Father God's name:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>John 5:43</b> - I have come in my Father's name, and you do not receive me. If another comes in his own name, you will receive him. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>John 10:25</b> - Jesus answered them, I told you, and you do not believe. The works that I do in my Father's name bear witness about me,
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Revelation of John 14:1</b> - Then I looked, and behold, on Mount Zion stood the Lamb, and with him 144, 000 who had his name and his Father's name written on their foreheads.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The Father is with the Son, the Father is in the Son, and the Son in the Father:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>John 10:30</b> - I and the Father are one.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The Father is not specifically the Son (Jesus
Christ), at least in title, but Jesus is the
Word, and the Word is God, and I think Jesus
Christ is still the Father in the sense that
Jesus Christ is in the Father, and the Father

distinction there between persons or titles,
and to be honest, I'm just trying to
rationalise this and understand how this fits
together and don't presume to know everything

<p>
<b>Romans 8:14-23</b> - For <span class="underline">all who are led by the Spirit of God are sons of God.</span> For you did not receive the spirit of slavery to fall back into fear, but you have received the Spirit of adoption as sons, by whom we cry, Abba! Father! The Spirit himself bears witness with our spirit that we are children of God, and if children, then heirs—heirs of God and fellow heirs with Christ, <span class="underline">provided we suffer with him in order that we may also be glorified with him.</span> For I consider that the sufferings of this present time are not worth comparing with the glory that is to be revealed to us. For the creation waits with eager longing for the revealing of the sons of God. For the creation was subjected to futility, not willingly, but because of him who subjected it, in hope that the creation itself will be set free from its bondage to decay and obtain the freedom of the glory of the children of God. For we know that the whole creation has been groaning together in the pains of childbirth until now. And not only the creation, but we ourselves, who have the firstfruits of the Spirit, groan inwardly as <span class="underline">we wait eagerly for adoption as sons, the redemption of our bodies.</span> (ESV)

Receiving is a mixture of believing, obeying, trusting, believing to receive - as Abraham's faith was. The faith to receive Jesus, getting to know Him I think is a span of time (it could be instantaneous to a lengthy period of time), I presume, as a person continues to trust Him:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Romans 4:9-12</b> - Is this blessing then only for the circumcised, or also for the uncircumcised? We say that faith was counted to Abraham as righteousness. How then was it counted to him? Was it before or after he had been circumcised? It was not after, but before he was circumcised. He received the sign of circumcision as a seal of the righteousness that he had by faith while he was still uncircumcised. The purpose was to make him the father of all who believe without being circumcised, so that righteousness would be counted to them as well, and to make him the father of the circumcised who are <span class="underline">not merely circumcised but who also walk in the footsteps of the faith that our father Abraham had before he was circumcised</span>.
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Galatians 3:7</b> - Know then that it is those of faith who are the sons of Abraham.
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Galatians 3:9</b> - So then, those who are of faith are blessed along with Abraham, the man of faith. (ESV)

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Romans 8:19</b> - For the creation waits with eager longing for the revealing of the sons of God. (ESV)

Having begun by the Spirit, are you now being perfected by the flesh? <span class="underline">Did you suffer so many things</span> in vain—if indeed it was in vain? Does he who supplies the Spirit to you and works miracles among you do so by works of the law, or by <span class="underline">hearing with faith—</span> just as Abraham believed God, and it was counted to him as righteousness?

<h3 id="org33201cd"><span class="section-number-3">58.6.</span> Inheriting the promises made to Abraham and to Christ</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-58-6">
<p>
The promises were made to Abraham and to Christ:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Galatians 3:16</b> - Now the promises were made to Abraham and to his offspring. It does not say, And to offsprings, referring to many, but referring to one, And to your offspring, who is Christ.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
But through the faith of Abraham in Jesus Christ, we inherit the promises because we have faith in Jesus Christ:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Galatians 3:22</b> - But the Scripture imprisoned everything under sin, so that the promise by faith in Jesus Christ might be given to those who believe.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Christ is formed in us, after all:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Galatians 4:18-19</b> - It is always good to be made much of for a good purpose, and not only when I am present with you, my little children, for whom I am again in the anguish of childbirth until Christ is formed in you!
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
In Christ Jesus, through faith, we are sons:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Galatians 3:25-26</b> - But now that faith has come, we are no longer under a guardian, for in Christ Jesus you are all sons of God, through faith.
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Acts 4:12</b> - And there is salvation in no one else, for there is no other name under heaven given among men by which we must be saved.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
We put on Christ when we are baptized into Christ:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Galatians 3:27</b> - For as many of you as were baptized into Christ have put on Christ.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
If you are Christ's (in Christ) then you are Abraham's offspring:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Galatians 3:29</b> - And if you are Christ's, then you are Abraham's offspring, heirs according to promise.
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Galatians 4:4-9</b> - But when the fullness of time had come, God sent forth his Son, born of woman, born under the law, to redeem those who were under the law, so that we might receive adoption as sons.  And because you are sons, God has sent the Spirit of his Son into our hearts, crying, Abba! Father!  So you are no longer a slave, but a son, and if a son, then an heir through God.  Formerly, when you did not know God, you were enslaved to those that by nature are not gods.  But now that you have come to know God, or rather to be known by God, how can you turn back again to the weak and worthless elementary principles of the world, whose slaves you want to be once more?
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The ones who love God, even demonstrated by repenting from sin and away from the course of this world, God gives to Jesus:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>John 17:6</b> - I have manifested your name to <span class="underline">the people whom you gave me out of the world.</span> Yours they were, and you gave them to me, and they have kept your word.
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>John 17:9</b> - I am praying for them. I am <span class="underline">not praying for the world but for those whom you have given me, for they are yours.</span>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
With the light of truth, people may go from darkness to light:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>John 12:36</b> - While you have the light, believe in the light, that you may become sons of light. When Jesus had said these things, he departed and hid himself from them.
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Acts 26:18</b> - to open their eyes, so that they may turn from darkness to light and from the power of Satan to God, that they may receive forgiveness of sins and a place among those who are sanctified by faith in me.
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>*Galatians 3:13-14</b> - Christ redeemed us from the curse of the law by becoming a curse for us—for it is written, Cursed is everyone who is hanged on a tree— so that in Christ Jesus the blessing of Abraham might come to the Gentiles, so that we might receive the promised Spirit through faith.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The world (the remaining people, who have not repented) may know that Father God has sent Jesus and loved Jesus' disciples:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>John 17:23</b> - I in them and you in me, that they may become perfectly one, <span class="underline">so that the world may know that you sent me and loved them even as you loved me.</span>

</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Hebrews 9:11-15</b> - But when Christ appeared as a high priest of the good things that have come, then through the greater and more perfect tent (not made with hands, that is, not of this creation) he entered once for all into the holy places, not by means of the blood of goats and calves but by means of his own blood, thus securing an eternal redemption. For if the sprinkling of defiled persons with the blood of goats and bulls and with the ashes of a heifer sanctifies for the purification of the flesh, how much more will the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself without blemish to God, purify our conscience from dead works to serve the living God. Therefore he is the mediator of a new covenant, so that those who are called may receive the promised eternal inheritance, since a death has occurred that redeems them from the transgressions committed under the first covenant.

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Hebrews 10:12-14</b> - But when Christ had offered for all time a single sacrifice for sins, he sat down at the right hand of God, waiting from that time until his enemies should be made a footstool for his feet. For by a single offering he has perfected for all time those who are being sanctified. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

Then he said to them, These are my words that I spoke to you while I was still with you, that everything written about me in the Law of Moses and the Prophets and the Psalms must be fulfilled. Then he opened their minds to understand the Scriptures, and said to them, Thus it is written, that the Christ should suffer and on the third day rise from the dead, and that repentance and forgiveness of sins should be proclaimed in his name to all nations, beginning from Jerusalem.

Gathering them together, He commanded them not to leave Jerusalem, but to wait for what the Father had promised, “Which,” He said, “you heard of from Me; for John baptized with water, but you will be baptized with <b>the Holy Spirit</b> not many days from now.” So when they had come together, they were asking Him, saying, “Lord, is it at this time You are restoring the kingdom to Israel?” He said to them, “It is not for you to know times or epochs which the Father has fixed by His own authority; but you will receive power when <b>the Holy Spirit</b> has come upon you; and you shall be My witnesses both in Jerusalem, and in all Judea and Samaria, and even to the remotest part of the earth.” And after He had said these things, He was lifted up while they were looking on, and a cloud received Him out of their sight.

</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>

God glorifies Jesus:
</p>

<p>

</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>John 8:54</b> - Jesus answered, If I glorify myself, my glory is nothing. It is my Father who glorifies me, of whom you say, He is our God.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
God glorifies Himself through glorifying Jesus through working through Jesus. The power comes from God:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>John 11:4</b> - But when Jesus heard it he said, This illness does not lead to death. It is for the glory of God, so that the Son of God may be glorified through it.
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>John 13:32</b> - If God is glorified in him, God will also glorify him in himself, and glorify him at once.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Jesus glorifies us, provided we suffer for His sake, by working through us to do God's work which also glorifies Jesus and glorifies God:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>John 14:13</b> - Whatever you ask in my name, this I will do, that the Father may be glorified in the Son.
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>

</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Romans 8:17</b> - and if children, then heirs—heirs of God and fellow heirs with Christ, provided we suffer with him in order that we may also be glorified with him. (ESV)
</p>

<p>
The Spirit whom those who have faith in Jesus receive works through us:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>John 7:39</b> - Now this he said about the Spirit, whom those who believed in him were to receive, for as yet the Spirit had not been given, because Jesus was not yet glorified.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Jesus glorified God by accomplishing the work that God gave Him - Jesus obeyed God.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>John 17:4</b> - I glorified you on earth, having accomplished the work that you gave me to do.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Likewise, we must obey God, and obey God by obeying Jesus, and being sanctified in the Truth. By having faith in Jesus and trusting in the Truth, and obeying, we are cleaned, transformed and made to glorify God:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>John 17:8-26</b> - For I have given them the words that you gave me, and they have received them and have come to know in truth that I came from you; and they have believed that you sent me.  I am praying for them. I am not praying for the world but for those whom you have given me, for they are yours.  All mine are yours, and yours are mine, and <span class="underline">I am glorified in them</span>.  And I am no longer in the world, but they are in the world, and I am coming to you. Holy Father, keep them in your name, which you have given me, that they may be one, even as we are one.  While I was with them, I kept them in your name, which you have given me. I have guarded them, and not one of them has been lost except the son of destruction, that the Scripture might be fulfilled.  But now I am coming to you, and these things I speak in the world, that they may have my joy fulfilled in themselves.  I have given them your word, and the world has hated them because they are not of the world, just as I am not of the world.  I do not ask that you take them out of the world, but that you keep them from the evil one.  They are not of the world, just as I am not of the world.  Sanctify them in the truth; your word is truth.  As you sent me into the world, so I have sent them into the world.  And for their sake I consecrate myself, that they also may be sanctified in truth.  I do not ask for these only, but also for those who will believe in me through their word, that they may all be one, just as you, Father, are in me, and I in you, that they also may be in us, so that the world may believe that you have sent me.  The glory that you have given me I have given to them, that they may be one even as we are one, I in them and you in me, that they may become perfectly one, so that the world may know that you sent me and loved them even as you loved me.  Father, I desire that they also, whom you have given me, may be with me where I am, to see my glory that you have given me because you loved me before the foundation of the world.  O righteous Father, even though the world does not know you, I know you, and these know that you have sent me.  I made known to them your name, and I will continue to make it known, that the love with which you have loved me may be in them, and I in them.

<p>
Glorification is the visible works of following Jesus including forgiving others, relieving others' burdens, etc. suffering for the sake of righteousness and obedience to God.
</p>

<p>
Imitating Jesus, forgiving others, walking righteously, and doing good works (bearing one-another's burdens) glorifies Jesus and glorifies God.
The motivation is to glorify Jesus, and to honour Jesus.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>I Corinthians 6:20</b> - for you were bought with a price. So glorify God in your body. (ESV)

<p>
This should never replace Jesus, but glorifies Jesus because it's being a disciple of Jesus.
</p>

</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
If someone's lord is money and not Jesus and then they try to do good works such as setting up businesses, I feel like this glorifies money, not Jesus.
</p>

<p>
Here, Zacchaeus, renounces money and makes Jesus his Lord. This must happen first.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Luke 19:8</b> - And Zacchaeus stood and said to the Lord, Behold, Lord, the half of my goods I give to the poor. And if I have defrauded anyone of anything, I restore it fourfold. (ESV)

<p>
Abram did this too. It's a necessary act of faith.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Genesis 14:20-24</b> - and blessed be God Most High, who has delivered your enemies into your hand! And Abram gave him a tenth of everything. And the king of Sodom said to Abram, Give me the persons, but take the goods for yourself. But Abram said to the king of Sodom, I have lifted my hand to the Lord, God Most High, Possessor of heaven and earth, that I would not take a thread or a sandal strap or anything that is yours, lest you should say, I have made Abram rich. I will take nothing but what the young men have eaten, and the share of the men who went with me. Let Aner, Eshcol, and Mamre take their share.

We are called to do the same, lightening the burdens of others.
We are forgiven and given grace, then we can choose to forgive others and lighten their burdens - grace propagates.

<b>Hebrews 12:4-6</b> - In your struggle against sin you have not yet resisted to the point of shedding your blood. And have you forgotten the exhortation that addresses you as sons?

<p>
You are required to:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>forgive others for your sake</li>
<li>forgive others for their sake</li>
<li>forgive others as a response of love to Jesus for your sins being forgiven</li>
<li>to be able to forgive others is a gift to you and part of glorification</li>
</ul>

<p>
This is simultaneously required and is part of glorification/holiness.
</p>

<p>
I think there's something very important about forgiving others especially for things which happen after being born-again of the Spirit and receiving <b>the Holy Spirit</b>.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Colossians 3:13</b> - bearing with one another and, if one has a complaint against another, forgiving each other; as the Lord has forgiven you, so you also must forgive.
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>John 20:21-23</b> - Jesus said to them again, Peace be with you. As the Father has sent me, even so I am sending you. And when he had said this, he breathed on them and said to them, Receive <b>the Holy Spirit</b>. If you forgive the sins of anyone, they are forgiven; if you withhold forgiveness from anyone, it is withheld.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Especially immediately after receiving <b>the Holy Spirit</b>, Jesus forgives those who you forgive - this is partaking in the process of forgiveness.
</p>

<p>
Jesus is the one who forgives sin, but we actually participate in propagating that forgiveness.
</p>

<p>
<i><b>Forgiving others entirely is also required</b></i>
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Matthew 6:12</b> - and forgive us our debts, as we also have forgiven our debtors.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
It's Christlike to forgive others' offences against us:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Proverbs 19:11</b> - Good sense makes one slow to anger, and it is his glory to overlook an offense. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
We'll be chastised if we do not forgive our brother from our heart:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Matthew 18:35</b> - So also my heavenly Father will do to every one of you, if you do not forgive your brother from your heart.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Our unforgiveness is an impediment to receiving forgiveness:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Mark 11:25</b> - And whenever you stand praying, forgive, if you have anything against anyone, so that your Father also who is in heaven may forgive you your trespasses.
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Matthew 6:14-15</b> - For if you forgive others their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you, but if you do not forgive others their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses. (ESV)

We should have the right response to the grace of God, and forgive our neighbour:

All the times a person has acted in Christlike obedience:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>forgiving others in knowledge they have been forgiven themselves</li>
<li>giving mercy to others in knowledge they have themselves received mercy</li>
<li>encouraging one-another</li>
<li>serve others</li>
<li>suffering as a Christian</li>
<li>etc.</li>

<p>
God glorifies Jesus (His Son) so Jesus may glorify Him (God).
Jesus glorifies us (His disciples) so we may glorify Him (Jesus) and glorify God by glorifying Jesus.
</p>

<p>
This is obedience.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>John 17:1</b> - When Jesus had spoken these words, he lifted up his eyes to heaven, and said, Father, the hour has come; glorify your Son that the Son may glorify you,
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>John 17:4</b> - I glorified you on earth, having accomplished the work that you gave me to do.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
God glorifies Jesus.
Jesus obeyed God and accomplished the work God gave Him.
Jesus showed God's truthfulness through His obedience. Jesus showed God to be true and glorified God:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Romans 15:8-9</b> - For I tell you that Christ became a servant to the circumcised to show God's truthfulness, in order to confirm the promises given to the patriarchs, and <b>in order that the Gentiles might glorify God for his mercy</b>. As it is written, Therefore I will praise you among the Gentiles, and sing to your name.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Jesus glorifies us:
We must obey Jesus and accomplish the work God gives us.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>John 8:54</b> - Jesus answered, If I glorify myself, my glory is nothing. It is my Father who glorifies me, of whom you say, He is our God.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Jesus is glorified in us - our glory is His glory because we obey Him and show Jesus's truthfulness as Jesus has shown God's truthfulness:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>John 17:22-23</b> - The glory that you have given me I have given to them, that they may be one even as we are one, I in them and you in me, that they may become perfectly one, so that the world may know that you sent me and loved them even as you loved me.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Jesus is glorified in us.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>John 17:10</b> - All mine are yours, and yours are mine, and <span class="underline">I am glorified in them</span>. (ESV)
</p>

<p>
Jesus accomplished His work.
we must accomplish our work.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>John 17:4</b> - I glorified you on earth, having accomplished the work that you gave me to do.

</blockquote>

<p>
Christlikeness:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>I Peter 2:12</b> - Keep your conduct among the Gentiles honorable, so that when they speak against you as evildoers, they may see your good deeds and glorify God on the day of visitation.
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Romans 12:1</b> - I appeal to you therefore, brothers, by the mercies of God, to present your bodies as a living sacrifice, holy and acceptable to God, which is your spiritual worship.
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Revelation of John 19:8</b> - it was granted her to clothe herself with fine linen, bright and pure— for the fine linen is the righteous deeds of the saints.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Suffering for Christian obedience, as Christ suffered for His obedience:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>John 21:18-19</b> - Truly, truly, I say to you, when you were young, you used to dress yourself and walk wherever you wanted, but when you are old, you will stretch out your hands, and another will dress you and carry you where you do not want to go. (This he said to show by what kind of death he was to glorify God. ) And after saying this he said to him, Follow me.
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>I Peter 4:16</b> - Yet if anyone suffers as a Christian, let him not be ashamed, but let him glorify God in that name.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Please your neighbour for their good:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Romans 15:2-3</b> - Let each of us please his neighbor for his good, to build him up. For Christ did not please himself, but as it is written, The reproaches of those who reproached you fell on me.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Welcome one another as Christ has welcomed you. Live in harmony with one-another, encouraging and serving one another [as Christ did]:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Romans 15:5-7</b> May the God of endurance and encouragement grant you to live in such harmony with one another, in accord with Christ Jesus, that together you may with one voice glorify the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ. Therefore welcome one another as Christ has welcomed you, for the glory of God.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Be merciful and serving to others, show God's truthfulness. glorify God by your conduct. Others then praise God:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Romans 15:8-9</b> - For I tell you that Christ became a servant to the circumcised to show God's truthfulness, in order to confirm the promises given to the patriarchs, and <b>in order that the Gentiles might glorify God for his mercy</b>. As it is written, Therefore I will praise you among the Gentiles, and sing to your name.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Supply the needs of the saints:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>II Corinthians 9:12</b> - For the ministry of this service is not only supplying the needs of the saints, but is also overflowing in many thanksgivings to God.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Be thankful to God:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>II Corinthians 9:13</b> - By their approval of this service, they will glorify God because of your submission flowing from your confession of the gospel of Christ, and the generosity of your contribution for them and for all others,
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Glorification can only come through being found in Jesus Christ:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Isaiah 42:8</b> - I am the LORD; that is my name; my glory I give to no other, nor my praise to carved idols. (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
And in Jesus Christ there is no sin:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>I John 3:5-6</b> - You know that he appeared to take away sins, and in him there is no sin. No one who abides in him keeps on sinning; no one who keeps on sinning has either seen him or known him.

For we did not follow cleverly devised myths when we made known to you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, but we were eyewitnesses of his majesty.  For when he received honor and glory from God the Father, and the voice was borne to him by the Majestic Glory, This is my beloved Son, with whom I am well pleased, we ourselves heard this very voice borne from heaven, for we were with him on the holy mountain.
