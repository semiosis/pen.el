Food for thought:

ASI (Artificial Super Intelligence) I see as abomination. Generative AI stuff (language models, etc.) I think definitely should be decentralised and broken up like the tower of babel. I like the idea, though, of =human-to-human prompting= where people prompt other real people.

The overall *goal* I think big tech has had towards bringing about ASI is clearly an abomination in my view. Centralisation of the technology incorporates theft, slavery, and idolatry. It is not good.

Consider William Wilberforce opposing on the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_India_Company][East India Company]] which was taking slaves.
By the early 19th century, the Company's army was 250,000-strong, larger than that of many nations.
Some people would have called Wilberforce a luddite. Some self-professing Christians might have even criticised Wilberforce saying there was nothing wrong with what the East India Company were doing. But some people, with Wilberforce would call it out for what it is - fundamentally wrong, evil.

Like Daniel with the king's wine, I refuse to imbibe on this generative AI stuff.

But *Daniel resolved that he would not defile himself with the king's food, or with the wine that he drank.* Therefore he asked the chief of the eunuchs to allow him not to defile himself. (ESV)

I was saying in 2021 on Reddit that this LLM stuff should not be used to rule like gods over other people. In judgement I'm against anyone who pressures me into using this LLM technology (which is founded on theft) for fear of me not being able to find work. This is a matter of me not wanting to live in Sodom/Babylon and practice the same unclean practices as the people living there, and also a matter of not wanting to participate in theft. I really hate lying and misrepresentation, and I think people who unrepentantly practice lying will be judged the way unrepentant liars are judged:

When I think of these large organisations building ASI with their gargantuan piggybanks with a goal of making supervisory AI, I just see it as trying to 'play God' and suck the creative blood out of more people - like the Matrix and people provide the entropy to fuel the system.

=ASI= (Artificial Super Intelligence) I rebuke in Jesus Christ's name. This ASI/AGI stuff is pure abomination in my view.
The real problem is that it's comparable to:
- Tower of Babel
  - [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eGzprqZfw3U][youtube.com: Deuteronomy 32 World View - There are Principalities That Rule over Nations]]
- A false god, trying to make some kind of substitute for God
- People making it the first port of call to solve problems - more than trusting Jesus' words
  - The way it's generally used and the way it's generally presented and 
- It just props up greed

I pray that God will smack it down.

And as people migrated from the east, they found a plain in the land of Shinar and settled there. And they said to one another, Come, let us make bricks, and burn them thoroughly. And they had brick for stone, and bitumen for mortar. Then they said, Come, let us build ourselves a city and a tower with its top in the heavens, and let us make a name for ourselves, lest we be dispersed over the face of the whole earth. And the LORD came down to see the city and the tower, which the children of man had built. And the LORD said, Behold, they are one people, and they have all one language, and this is only the beginning of what they will do. And nothing that they propose to do will now be impossible for them. Come, let us go down and there confuse their language, so that they may not understand one another's speech. So the LORD dispersed them from there over the face of all the earth, and they left off building the city. Therefore its name was called Babel, because there the LORD confused the language of all the earth. And from there the LORD dispersed them over the face of all the earth. (ESV)

Even if this AI stuff spits out things which are considered "factual", if people use it like some kind of oracle to "speak for God" then it is abomination:

She followed Paul and us, crying out, These men are servants of the Most High God, who proclaim to you the way of salvation. And this she kept doing for many days. Paul, having become greatly annoyed, turned and said to the spirit, I command you in the name of Jesus Christ to come out of her. And it came out that very hour. (ESV)

I do not think we should be distributing media where AI has been used to paraphrase or "interpret" the Scripture. I consider such media to be unclean.

For example, a "Jesus" chatbot I consider to be pure abomination. God hates to be misrepresented. We do not want to imbibe on AI-generated media. Jesus prayed for His disciples to be sanctified in the Truth which is the Word of God. This is important.

I'm going to do my best to avoid AI-generated media like the plague:

Also, I don't consider putting chips into people's brains either to be a solution.

+ [[https://www.youtube.com/post/UgkxY53TLUexojeYIPbM5Adjuov-buqRRvv8][Paul Washer]] :: That's why we don't entertain here. This is not a game. There is a serpent out there, and those of you that are children of God, he wants to wrap his filth around you and soil you. And he wants to stick his fangs in you. And if we are men of God, we love the children of God. And it breaks our hearts so we don't have time for silly dramas, and smoke, and dry ice, and parties, and laughter. We want to tell you there's a war going on, and your life depends on you following truth. Some of you will leave here and grow older and destroy your lives. Some of you will stand before God one day and be thrown in hell.  This is the burden of a man of God, not to make sure that you have self-esteem, that your checkbook's balanced or that you have your best life now. The great thing is this: Will you not only survive but will you triumph in Christ? And to do that you must give great concern for yourself, for your heart.  Now, remember that I said purity of heart deals with a heart that is not mixed or alloyed. Let me put it this way – It has no competing loyalties. It has one king and that is Jesus Christ and one law and that is the Word of God.
