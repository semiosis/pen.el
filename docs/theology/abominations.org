=ASI= (Artificial Super Intelligence) I rebuke in Jesus Christ's name. This ASI/AGI stuff is pure abomination in my view.
The real problem is that it's comparable to:
- Tower of Babel
- A false god, trying to make some kind of substitute for God
- It just props up greed

I pray that God will smack it down.

  *[[https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis%2011%3A1-9&version=ESV][Genesis 11:1-9]]* - Now the whole earth had one language and the same words. And as people migrated from the east, they found a plain in the land of Shinar and settled there. And they said to one another, Come, let us make bricks, and burn them thoroughly. And they had brick for stone, and bitumen for mortar. Then they said, Come, let us build ourselves a city and a tower with its top in the heavens, and let us make a name for ourselves, lest we be dispersed over the face of the whole earth. And the LORD came down to see the city and the tower, which the children of man had built. And the LORD said, Behold, they are one people, and they have all one language, and this is only the beginning of what they will do. And nothing that they propose to do will now be impossible for them. Come, let us go down and there confuse their language, so that they may not understand one another's speech. So the LORD dispersed them from there over the face of all the earth, and they left off building the city. Therefore its name was called Babel, because there the LORD confused the language of all the earth. And from there the LORD dispersed them over the face of all the earth. (ESV)

Even if this AI stuff spits out things which are considered "factual", if people use it like some kind of oracle to "speak for God" then it is abomination:

  *[[https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts%2016%3A16-18&version=ESV][Acts 16:16-18]]* - As we were going to the place of prayer, we were met by a slave girl who had a spirit of divination and brought her owners much gain by fortune-telling. She followed Paul and us, crying out, These men are servants of the Most High God, who proclaim to you the way of salvation. And this she kept doing for many days. Paul, having become greatly annoyed, turned and said to the spirit, I command you in the name of Jesus Christ to come out of her. And it came out that very hour. (ESV)

For example, a "Jesus" chatbot I consider to be pure abomination.

I'm going to do my best to avoid it like the plague:

  *[[https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation%2018%3A4&version=ESV][Revelation of John 18:4]]* - Then I heard another voice from heaven saying, Come out of her, my people, lest you take part in her sins, lest you share in her plagues; (ESV)

Also, I don't consider putting chips into people's brains either to be a solution.
