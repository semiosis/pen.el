ASI (Artificial Super Intelligence) I see as abomination. Generative AI stuff (language models, etc.) I think definitely should be decentralised and broken up like the tower of babel. I like the idea, though, of =human-to-human prompting= where people prompt other real people.

When we consider that the 2 Great Commandments are to love God out of all our heart, with all our soul, with all our mind, with all our strength and our neighbour as ourself and that
on these 2 Great Commandments depend all the Law and Prophets, how then is
is it any way lawful to make something using stolen assets in order to (intenting with it to) build something that serves as a false god, as in so-called "artificial super intelligence"?

The overall *goal* I think big tech has had towards bringing about ASI is clearly an abomination in my view. Centralisation of the technology incorporates theft, slavery, and idolatry. It is not good.

Consider William Wilberforce opposing on the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_India_Company][East India Company]] which was taking slaves.
By the early 19th century, the Company's army was 250,000-strong, larger than that of many nations.
Some people would have called Wilberforce a luddite. Some self-professing Christians might have even criticised Wilberforce saying there was nothing wrong with what the East India Company were doing. But some people, with Wilberforce would call it out for what it is - fundamentally wrong, evil.

Like Daniel with the king's wine, I refuse to imbibe on this generative AI stuff.

I was saying in 2021 on Reddit that this LLM stuff should not be used to rule like gods over other people. In judgement I'm against anyone who pressures me into using this LLM technology (which is founded on theft) for fear of me not being able to find work. This is a matter of me not wanting to live in Sodom/Babylon and practice the same unclean practices as the people living there, and also a matter of not wanting to participate in theft. I really hate lying and misrepresentation, and I think people who unrepentantly practice lying will be judged the way unrepentant liars are judged:

When I think of these large organisations building ASI with their gargantuan piggybanks with a goal of making supervisory AI, I just see it as trying to 'play God' and suck the creative blood out of more people - like the Matrix and people provide the entropy to fuel the system.

=ASI= (Artificial Super Intelligence) I rebuke in Jesus Christ's name. This ASI/AGI stuff is pure abomination in my view.
The real problem is that it's comparable to:
- Tower of Babel
  - [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eGzprqZfw3U][youtube.com: Deuteronomy 32 World View - There are Principalities That Rule over Nations]]
- A false god, trying to make some kind of substitute for God
- People making it the first port of call to solve problems - more than trusting Jesus' words
  - The way it's generally used and the way it's generally presented and 
- It just props up greed

I pray that God will smack it down.

And as people migrated from the east, they found a plain in the land of Shinar and settled there. And they said to one another, Come, let us make bricks, and burn them thoroughly. And they had brick for stone, and bitumen for mortar. Then they said, Come, let us build ourselves a city and a tower with its top in the heavens, and let us make a name for ourselves, lest we be dispersed over the face of the whole earth. And the LORD came down to see the city and the tower, which the children of man had built. And the LORD said, Behold, they are one people, and they have all one language, and this is only the beginning of what they will do. And nothing that they propose to do will now be impossible for them. Come, let us go down and there confuse their language, so that they may not understand one another's speech. So the LORD dispersed them from there over the face of all the earth, and they left off building the city. Therefore its name was called Babel, because there the LORD confused the language of all the earth. And from there the LORD dispersed them over the face of all the earth. (ESV)

I do not think we should be distributing media where AI has been used to paraphrase or "interpret" the Scripture. I consider such media to be unclean.

For example, a "Jesus" chatbot I consider to be pure abomination. God hates to be misrepresented. We do not want to imbibe on AI-generated media. Jesus prayed for His disciples to be sanctified in the Truth which is the Word of God. This is important.

I'm going to do my best to avoid AI-generated media like the plague:

There is a serpent out there, and those of you that are children of God, he wants to wrap his filth around you and soil you. And he wants to stick his fangs in you. And if we are men of God, we love the children of God. And it breaks our hearts so we don't have time for silly dramas, and smoke, and dry ice, and parties, and laughter. We want to tell you there's a war going on, and your life depends on you following truth. Some of you will leave here and grow older and destroy your lives. Some of you will stand before God one day and be thrown in hell.  This is the burden of a man of God, not to make sure that you have self-esteem, that your checkbook's balanced or that you have your best life now. The great thing is this: Will you not only survive but will you triumph in Christ? And to do that you must give great concern for yourself, for your heart.  Now, remember that I said purity of heart deals with a heart that is not mixed or alloyed. Let me put it this way – It has no competing loyalties. It has one king and that is Jesus Christ and one law and that is the Word of God.

The gospel is to get delivered from the present evil age. I consider that AI stuff to be (potentially) a man-in-the-middle attack against relationship with God through Jesus Christ, keeping Jesus Christ's commandments. It's so convenient that it's dangerous. The way to understand the scriptures is to do the will of God as you are digesting the word. Put it into practice. Keep Jesus' commandments. Maintain a good conscience with God. Do what pleases Him. To be doing maintaining holiness is CRUCIAL for pastors. Generative AI is a massive problem - searching for sermons however is less problematic. But AI-generated sermons is darkness. It's not good. I abominate it.

The AGI stuff is very detached from reality.
It's very unlawful.
People are pursuing it to get rich from exploiting other people and
people are using it to write for them and misrepresent themselves and others.

and I stand in judgement against those who have put such pressure on others to practice lies and deceit through the AI systems
in order to survive.

  *Matthew 24:1-51* - Jesus left the temple and was going away, when his disciples came to point out to him the buildings of the temple. But he answered them, You see all these, do you not? Truly, I say to you, there will not be left here one stone upon another that will not be thrown down. As he sat on the Mount of Olives, the disciples came to him privately, saying, Tell us, when will these things be, and what will be the sign of your coming and of the close of the age? And Jesus answered them, See that no one leads you astray. For many will come in my name, saying, I am the Christ, and they will lead many astray. And you will hear of wars and rumors of wars. See that you are not alarmed, for this must take place, but the end is not yet. For nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom, and there will be famines and earthquakes in various places. All these are but the beginning of the birth pains. Then they will deliver you up to tribulation and put you to death, and you will be hated by all nations for my name's sake. And then many will fall away and betray one another and hate one another. And many false prophets will arise and lead many astray. And because lawlessness will be increased, the love of many will grow cold. But the one who endures to the end will be saved. And this gospel of the kingdom will be proclaimed throughout the whole world as a testimony to all nations, and then the end will come. So when you see the abomination of desolation spoken of by the prophet Daniel, standing in the holy place (let the reader understand), then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains. Let the one who is on the housetop not go down to take what is in his house, and let the one who is in the field not turn back to take his cloak. And alas for women who are pregnant and for those who are nursing infants in those days! Pray that your flight may not be in winter or on a Sabbath. For then there will be great tribulation, such as has not been from the beginning of the world until now, no, and never will be. And if those days had not been cut short, no human being would be saved. But for the sake of the elect those days will be cut short. Then if anyone says to you, Look, here is the Christ! or There he is! do not believe it. For false christs and false prophets will arise and perform great signs and wonders, so as to lead astray, if possible, even the elect. See, I have told you beforehand. So, if they say to you, Look, he is in the wilderness, do not go out. If they say, Look, he is in the inner rooms, do not believe it. For as the lightning comes from the east and shines as far as the west, so will be the coming of the Son of Man. Wherever the corpse is, there the vultures will gather. Immediately after the tribulation of those days the sun will be darkened, and the moon will not give its light, and the stars will fall from heaven, and the powers of the heavens will be shaken. Then will appear in heaven the sign of the Son of Man, and then all the tribes of the earth will mourn, and they will see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of heaven with power and great glory. And he will send out his angels with a loud trumpet call, and they will gather his elect from the four winds, from one end of heaven to the other. From the fig tree learn its lesson: as soon as its branch becomes tender and puts out its leaves, you know that summer is near. So also, when you see all these things, you know that he is near, at the very gates. Truly, I say to you, this generation will not pass away until all these things take place. Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will not pass away. But concerning that day and hour no one knows, not even the angels of heaven, nor the Son, but the Father only. As were the days of Noah, so will be the coming of the Son of Man. For as in those days before the flood they were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, until the day when Noah entered the ark, and they were unaware until the flood came and swept them all away, so will be the coming of the Son of Man. Then two men will be in the field; one will be taken and one left. Two women will be grinding at the mill; one will be taken and one left. Therefore, stay awake, for you do not know on what day your Lord is coming. But know this, that if the master of the house had known in what part of the night the thief was coming, he would have stayed awake and would not have let his house be broken into. Therefore you also must be ready, for the Son of Man is coming at an hour you do not expect. Who then is the faithful and wise servant, whom his master has set over his household, to give them their food at the proper time? Blessed is that servant whom his master will find so doing when he comes. Truly, I say to you, he will set him over all his possessions. But if that wicked servant says to himself, My master is delayed, and begins to beat his fellow servants and eats and drinks with drunkards, the master of that servant will come on a day when he does not expect him and at an hour he does not know and will cut him in pieces and put him with the hypocrites. In that place there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth. (ESV)
