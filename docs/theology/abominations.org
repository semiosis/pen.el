=ASI= (Artificial Super Intelligence) I rebuke in Jesus Christ's name. This ASI/AGI stuff is pure abomination in my view.
The real problem is that it's comparable to:
- Tower of Babel
  - [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eGzprqZfw3U][youtube.com: Deuteronomy 32 World View - There are Principalities That Rule over Nations]]
- A false god, trying to make some kind of substitute for God
- It just props up greed

I pray that God will smack it down.

  *[[https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis%2011%3A1-9&version=ESV][Genesis 11:1-9]]* - Now the whole earth had one language and the same words. And as people migrated from the east, they found a plain in the land of Shinar and settled there. And they said to one another, Come, let us make bricks, and burn them thoroughly. And they had brick for stone, and bitumen for mortar. Then they said, Come, let us build ourselves a city and a tower with its top in the heavens, and let us make a name for ourselves, lest we be dispersed over the face of the whole earth. And the LORD came down to see the city and the tower, which the children of man had built. And the LORD said, Behold, they are one people, and they have all one language, and this is only the beginning of what they will do. And nothing that they propose to do will now be impossible for them. Come, let us go down and there confuse their language, so that they may not understand one another's speech. So the LORD dispersed them from there over the face of all the earth, and they left off building the city. Therefore its name was called Babel, because there the LORD confused the language of all the earth. And from there the LORD dispersed them over the face of all the earth. (ESV)

Even if this AI stuff spits out things which are considered "factual", if people use it like some kind of oracle to "speak for God" then it is abomination:

  *[[https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts%2016%3A16-18&version=ESV][Acts 16:16-18]]* - As we were going to the place of prayer, we were met by a slave girl who had a spirit of divination and brought her owners much gain by fortune-telling. She followed Paul and us, crying out, These men are servants of the Most High God, who proclaim to you the way of salvation. And this she kept doing for many days. Paul, having become greatly annoyed, turned and said to the spirit, I command you in the name of Jesus Christ to come out of her. And it came out that very hour. (ESV)

I do not think we should be distributing media where AI has been used to paraphrase or "interpret" the Scripture. I consider such media to be unclean.

For example, a "Jesus" chatbot I consider to be pure abomination. God hates to be misrepresented. We do not want to imbibe on AI-generated media. Jesus prayed for His disciples to be sanctified in the Truth which is the Word of God. This is important.

I'm going to do my best to avoid AI-generated media like the plague:

Rather, we should be listening to the Holy Spirit, and being doers of the Word, willing to do the will of God and escaping the defilement of the world:

  *[[https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%2016%3A13-14&version=ESV][John 16:13-14]]* - When the Spirit of truth comes, he will guide you into all the truth, for he will not speak on his own authority, but whatever he hears he will speak, and he will declare to you the things that are to come. He will glorify me, for he will take what is mine and declare it to you. (ESV)

  *[[https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%207%3A16-18&version=ESV][John 7:16-18]]* - So Jesus answered them, My teaching is not mine, but his who sent me. If anyone's will is to do God's will, he will know whether the teaching is from God or whether I am speaking on my own authority. The one who speaks on his own authority seeks his own glory, but the one who seeks the glory of him who sent him is true, and in him there is no falsehood. (ESV)

Also, I don't consider putting chips into people's brains either to be a solution.

The only solution is the [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9L-ZM0g6yf0][Kingdom of God]] - (Watch: [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9L-ZM0g6yf0][youtube.com: Thy Kingdom Come | Sermon]]. Read: [[./resources/Derek-Prince-Thy-Kingdom-Come.org]]).
