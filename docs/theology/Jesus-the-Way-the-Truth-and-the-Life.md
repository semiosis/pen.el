# The Way the Truth and the Life

-   **[youtube.com: 2013 05 26 A I Am The Way  Truth and Life   Dr  Steven J  Lawson   526131753512 @time: 9 min 33 sec](https://youtube.com/watch?v=-33jh183A1s&t=573):** Jesus Himself is personally the way to the
    Father. Religion is not the way to the
    Father. Ritual is not the way to the
    Father. Neither is good works or church
    or a church attendance or baptism. But
    Jesus Christ Himself is the way to the
    Father. And when he says **THE** way he is
    making an exclusive claim to be the one
    and only true way of salvation that
    leads from this world into the very
    presence of God.
    
    Jesus came to actually be the way to provide the
    way by his life and by his death.

    does not believe has been judged already
    because he has not believed in the name
    of the only begotten Son of God. What is
    it to believe in Jesus Christ? It is to
    believe that you're lost, that you cannot
    save yourself. It is to believe that
    Jesus Christ has come into the world to
    save sinners. It is to come to a place
    where you recognize this, you confess
    your sin, and you commit your life
    entirely to Jesus Christ. It is to come
    to the end of yourself. It is to
    surrender your life to Christ. It is to
    say I can no longer direct my life. I can
    no longer be the one who presides over
    my life. It is to surrender and to submit
    to the lordship of Jesus Christ. It is to
    deny yourself, take up a cross and begin
    to follow after Jesus Christ. This is the
    truth concerning how to enter the way.
    
    He who believes in the son
    has eternal life but he who does not
    obey the son will not see life but the
    wrath of God abides on him.
    
    Please note how believe in obey are used
    synonymously in parallel fashion. To
    believe is to obey Jesus Christ.
    
    Saving faith is always an act of
    obedience to God who says you must
    submit your life to my son Jesus Christ.
    
    Unbelief is disobedience true faith is a
    step of obedience and this requirement
    of faith.

    in which Jesus says I am the way, **and** the
    truth **and** the life. This is not a
    multiple-choice. It's not, "Who here today
    would like to have one of these three.
    Who here today we'd like to have two of
    these three? The word 'and' joins them
    all together that they are inseparably
    bound, and what Jesus is saying as He **is**
    the Life, that the one who believes the
    Truth will enter the Way and all who are
    on the Way will have the Life, will know
    the Life, will have the Life of God
    within them. They're not just on a path,
    they *are* on a path, which is Christ, but
    they also have Christ inside of them as
    they are on the way they will never
    travel the way solo. They will never
    travel the way by themselves. They will
    always have Jesus Christ Himself with
    them and more than just with them they
    will have Him in them. They will have the
    Life within them.
    
    Jesus says, "I am the way
    and the truth and the life. This third
    heading is Jesus is the **only** life in God,
    or from God. Those who receive the truth,
    receive the life. Those who *refuse* the
    truth *refuse* the life.

> **[Acts 4:12](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts%204%3A12&version=ESV)** - And there is salvation in no one else, for there is no other name under heaven given among men by which we must be saved. (ESV)

> **[I John 5:11-13](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20John%205%3A11-13&version=ESV)** - And this is the testimony, that God gave us eternal life, and this life is in his Son. Whoever has the Son has life; whoever does not have the Son of God does not have life. I write these things to you who believe in the name of the Son of God that you may know that you have eternal life. (ESV)

> **[John 17:3](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%2017%3A3&version=ESV)** - And this is eternal life, that they know you the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom you have sent. (ESV)

    have God within you, within your soul, and
    to commune with God, and to fellowship with
    God, and to work to walk with God. Without
    this life, we are spiritually dead.
    Without this life, we are spiritually
    empty and hollow and have nothing.
    But all who believe in Christ are made
    spiritually alive. They know God.
    They love God, they adore God, they respond to
    God. This is the life that Jesus has come
    to give.


# We are called to follow Jesus

> **[I Corinthians 1:4-8](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Corinthians%201%3A4-8&version=ESV)** - I give thanks to my God always for you because of the grace of God that was given you in Christ Jesus, that in every way you were enriched in him in all speech and all knowledge— even as the testimony about Christ was confirmed among you— so that you are not lacking in any spiritual gift, as you wait for the revealing of our Lord Jesus Christ, who will sustain you to the end, guiltless in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ. (ESV)

> **[I Corinthians 1:9](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Corinthians%201%3A9&version=ESV)** - God is faithful, by whom you were called into the fellowship of his Son, Jesus Christ our Lord. (ESV)

> **[I Corinthians 1:12](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Corinthians%201%3A12&version=ESV)** - What I mean is that each one of you says, I follow Paul, or I follow Apollos, or I follow Cephas, or I follow Christ. (ESV)

> **[I Corinthians 1:21](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Corinthians%201%3A21&version=ESV)** - For since, in the wisdom of God, the world did not know God through wisdom, it pleased God through the folly of what we preach to save those who believe. (ESV)

> **[I Corinthians 1:22-24](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Corinthians%201%3A22-24&version=ESV)** - For Jews demand signs and Greeks seek wisdom, but we preach Christ crucified, a stumbling block to Jews and folly to Gentiles, but to those who are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God and the wisdom of God. (ESV)

# We must come to a place where give our life entirely to Jesus and believe in Jesus

We recognise we need Jesus.
We entrust our soul and our life entirely to Jesus Christ.
We trust in Him. We believe in Him.

> **[John 9:30-41](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%209%3A30-41&version=ESV)** - The man answered, Why, this is an amazing thing! You do not know where he comes from, and yet he opened my eyes. We know that God does not listen to sinners, but if anyone is a worshiper of God and does his will, God listens to him. Never since the world began has it been heard that anyone opened the eyes of a man born blind. If this man were not from God, he could do nothing. They answered him, You were born in utter sin, and would you teach us? And they cast him out. Jesus heard that they had cast him out, and having found him he said, `Do you believe in the Son of Man?` He answered, And who is he, sir, that I may believe in him? Jesus said to him, `You have seen him, and it is he who is speaking to you`. He said, Lord, I believe, and he worshiped him. Jesus said, `For judgment I came into this world, that those who do not see may see, and those who see may become blind`. Some of the Pharisees near him heard these things, and said to him, Are we also blind? Jesus said to them, `If you were blind, you would have no guilt; but now that you say, We see, your guilt remains.` (ESV)

> **[Mark 5:36](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark%205%3A36&version=ESV)** - But overhearing what they said, Jesus said to the ruler of the synagogue, Do not fear, only believe. (ESV)

> **[Luke 14:23](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke%2014%3A23&version=ESV)** - And the master said to the servant, Go out to the highways and hedges and compel people to come in, that my house may be filled. (ESV)

> **[I Thessalonians 2:15-16](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Thessalonians%202%3A15-16&version=ESV)** - who killed both the Lord Jesus and the prophets, and drove us out, and displease God and oppose all mankind by hindering us from speaking to the Gentiles that they might be saved—so as always to fill up the measure of their sins. But God's wrath has come upon them at last! (ESV)

> **[I Corinthians 1:17-18](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Corinthians%201%3A17-18&version=ESV)** - For Christ did not send me to baptize but to preach the gospel, and not with words of eloquent wisdom, lest the cross of Christ be emptied of its power. For the word of the cross is folly to those who are perishing, but to us who are being saved it is the power of God. (ESV)
