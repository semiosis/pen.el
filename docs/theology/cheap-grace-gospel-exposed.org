Jesus, through salvation, makes us born againâ€¦made anew and you become a new creation!! Faith without works is dead, through the heart of Christ that transforms us we want to do as Christ did and does. Glory to God. So your life must change if Christ is living in you, in all the ways the Bible says. Let no one be deceived.

  *II Corinthians 5:14-17* - For the love of Christ controls us, because we have concluded this: that one has died for all, therefore all have died; and he died for all, that those who live might no longer live for themselves but for him who for their sake died and was raised. From now on, therefore, we regard no one according to the flesh. Even though we once regarded Christ according to the flesh, we regard him thus no longer. Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation. The old has passed away; behold, the new has come.

  there are people that believe this
  absolutely insane
  theology that there is a difference
  between simply being a Christian and
  being a disciple of Jesus Christ they
  say that being a Christian is free but
  being a disciple is costly but the Bible
  never makes this
  distinction being a Christian and being
  a disciple are one and the same the
  reason that people believe this and read
  this into the text is because they
  believe in a false Gospel called the
  cheap Grace Gospel as opposed to the
  free Grace Gospel they believe that a
  person can be born again and it's
  possible that no transformation can
  happen because they wrongly believe that
  if transformation is a result of the
  Born Again experience and a person
  becoming a Christian then a person is
  saved by works and what they do and it's
  a Works based gospel but that is just
  simply not the case and then what they
  do is they throw out a whole bunch of
  verses that clearly illustrate that
  there in a general sense is a
  transformation in the life of a Believer
  and there is evidence that follows that
  transformation they try to explain it
  away and they do it very very poorly uh
  they completely twist the verses uh in
  ways that you wouldn't even
  believe uh to try to arrive at that
  place because they are convinced that a
  person can be born again and there can
  be no transformation at the Born Again
  experience that it's possible for that
  to
  happen now what they do with this whole
  Christian and disciple thing is because
  there are other verses that they can't
  get around whatsoever even with the
  craziest explanations that they
  try they have to separate Christian from
  disciple like for example when Jesus
  says if anyone would come after me let
  him deny himself take up his cross and
  follow me they say well this can't be
  talking about a
  Christian it has to be talking about a
  disciple and the two then have to be
  separate because um otherwise it's
  showing that a Christian will live a
  transformed life and and and we can't
  have that if we believe the cheap Grace
  Gospel but let me completely debunk that
  with one
  passage so let's go to Matthew chapter
  disciples if anyone would come after me
  let him deny himself take up his cross
  and follow me and these people will then
  say see this is talking about Disciple
  This isn't talking about just any
  Christian this isn't talking about a
  person who's just given their life to
  Christ this is talking about someone who
  wants to live a costly life who wants to
  walk in Greater levels of obedience and
  sacrifice for Christ so that doesn't
  prove that a Christian lives a
  transformed life let's read on though
  verse 25 for whoever would save his life
  will lose it but whoever loses his life
  for my sake will find it isn't that
  interesting interesting let's read one
  more verse verse
  gains the whole world and forfeits his
  soul or what shall a man give in return
  for his soul that's talking about
  salvation right there talking about
  someone forfeiting their soul being
  separated from
  God so when we see Jesus is saying if
  anyone would come after him and follow
  him he's talking about
  salvation clearly In this passage that a
  person if they don't come after him and
  follow him will forfeit their soul and
  the person who does come after him and
  follow him will lay down their life take
  up their cross and follow
  [Music]
  him this is not a Works based gospel
  works are never the means by which we
  are saved works are not something that
  ever keep us saved this is something
  false that these people project onto
  people that believe the true gospel but
  rather this is the
  result this this denial of self this
  transformation is a result of the
  transformation that takes place in the
  Born Again experience it's not sinless
  Perfection but rather it is a change of
  affection people that deny this they
  deny the power of the Holy Spirit they
  deny the power of the born- again
  experience they deny the spirit's power
  working within the life of a Believer to
  bring about Godly sorrow to bring about
  repentance to bring about conviction of
  sin and they make the false conflation
  that if a person if a transformation has
  to have taken place when a person is
  born again therefore they're relying on
  their Works to be saved or keep them
  saved which I've already said is
  completely
  false now what people need to do is not
  get caught up in looking for works all
  over the place that's true people can so
  readily doubt their salvation which is
  dangerous because we are saved by the
  finished work of Jesus Christ
  and there are people out there who every
  time they stumble they doubt their
  salvation and God doesn't want this for
  us at all it's definitely a danger
  people can fall into but what I would
  say to you is if you're someone who is
  struggling with this one of the greatest
  evidences that you are born again is the
  fact that you are struggling with this
  because there are people out there who
  they don't even care about their sin
  they they they love their sin they
  indulge in their sin they're slaves to
  sin if you're feeling a sorrow for a
  grief in your
  heart for the sin in your life then it's
  a sign that the holy spirit is working
  inside of you and you don't have to look
  to those feelings you don't have to look
  to your works just run to Jesus Christ
  look at the cross get hold of every
  verse that talks about how where sin
  abounds the grace of God abounds all the
  more how uh God showed his love for us
  in that while we were still sinners
  Christ died for us and just medit Med
  itate on that and just rest in the
  finished work of Christ that sorrow that
  conviction for your sin is a sign that
  you've been transformed because the
  people out there in the world they don't
  even experience that so friends don't
  fall for this absolute nonsense that
  there's a difference between being a
  Christian and being a disciple don't
  fall for the lies of the Blasphemous
  cheap Grace Gospel which denies the
  power of God
  and which twists scripture denies
  scripture don't fall for that the early
  church fathers who were taught directly
  by the apostles never believed in that
  all of the prominent people throughout
  church history never believed in that
  and the scriptures most certainly do not
  teach that it is one of the most insane
  doctrines that you will come across I'm
  going to put a video up on the screen
  which goes over some of the verses that
  shows the that there will be a
  transformation in the life of a born-
  again believer I'll put that on the
  screen uh you're really going to be
  blessed by that um if you have any
  comments leave them below and I would
  love to talk to you soon God bless you
  friends
