Jesus, through salvation, makes us born again…made anew and you become a new
creation!! Faith without works is dead, through the heart of Christ that
transforms us we want to do as Christ did and does. Glory to God. So your
life must change if Christ is living in you, in all the ways the Bible says.
Let no one be deceived.

  II Corinthians 5:14-17 - For the love of Christ controls us, because we
  have concluded this: that one has died for all, therefore all have died;
  and he died for all, that those who live might no longer live for
  themselves but for him who for their sake died and was raised. From now
  on, therefore, we regard no one according to the flesh. Even though we
  once regarded Christ according to the flesh, we regard him thus no longer.
  Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation. The old has
  passed away; behold, the new has come.

  Galatians 6:15 - For neither circumcision counts for anything, nor
  uncircumcision, but a new creation. (ESV)

  Galatians 5:6 - For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision nor
  uncircumcision counts for anything, but only faith working through love.
  (ESV)

  I Corinthians 7:19 - For neither circumcision counts for anything nor
  uncircumcision, but keeping the commandments of God. (ESV)

  Ezekiel 11:19-20 - And I will give them one heart, and a new spirit I will
  put within them. I will remove the heart of stone from their flesh and
  give them a heart of flesh, that they may walk in my statutes and keep my
  rules and obey them. And they shall be my people, and I will be their God.
  (ESV)

|  there are people that believe this
|  absolutely insane
|  theology that there is a difference
|  between simply being a Christian and
|  being a disciple of Jesus Christ they
|  say that being a Christian is free but
|  being a disciple is costly but the Bible
|  never makes this
|  distinction being a Christian and being
|   a disciple are one and the same the
|   reason that people believe this and read
|   this into the text is because they
|   believe in a false Gospel called the
|   cheap Grace Gospel as opposed to the
|   free Grace Gospel they believe that a
|   person can be born again and it's
|   possible that no transformation can
|   happen because they wrongly believe that
|   if transformation is a result of the
|   Born Again experience and a person
|   becoming a Christian then a person is
|   saved by works and what they do and it's
|   a Works based gospel but that is just
|   simply not the case and then what they
|   do is they throw out a whole bunch of
|   verses that clearly illustrate that
|   there in a general sense is a
|   transformation in the life of a Believer
|   and there is evidence that follows that
|   transformation they try to explain it
|   away and they do it very very poorly uh
|   they completely twist the verses uh in
|   ways that you wouldn't even
|   believe uh to try to arrive at that
|   place because they are convinced that a
|   person can be born again and there can
|   be no transformation at the Born Again
|   experience that it's possible for that
|   to
|   happen now what they do with this whole
|   Christian and disciple thing is because
|   there are other verses that they can't
|   get around whatsoever even with the
|   craziest explanations that they
|   try they have to separate Christian from
|   disciple like for example when Jesus
|   says if anyone would come after me let
|   him deny himself take up his cross and
|   follow me they say well this can't be
|   talking about a
|   Christian it has to be talking about a
|   disciple and the two then have to be
|   separate because um otherwise it's
|   showing that a Christian will live a
|   transformed life and and and we can't
|   have that if we believe the cheap Grace
|   Gospel but let me completely debunk that
|   with one
|   passage so let's go to Matthew chapter
|   disciples if anyone would come after me
|   let him deny himself take up his cross
|   and follow me and these people will then
|   say see this is talking about Disciple
|   This isn't talking about just any
|   Christian this isn't talking about a
|   person who's just given their life to
|   Christ this is talking about someone who
|   wants to live a costly life who wants to
|   walk in Greater levels of obedience and
|   sacrifice for Christ so that doesn't
|   prove that a Christian lives a
|   transformed life let's read on though
|   verse 25 for whoever would save his life
|   will lose it but whoever loses his life
|   for my sake will find it isn't that
|   interesting interesting let's read one
|   more verse verse
|   gains the whole world and forfeits his
|   soul or what shall a man give in return
|   for his soul that's talking about
|   salvation right there talking about
|   someone forfeiting their soul being
|   separated from
|   God so when we see Jesus is saying if
|   anyone would come after him and follow
|   him he's talking about
|   salvation clearly In this passage that a
|   person if they don't come after him and
|   follow him will forfeit their soul and
|   the person who does come after him and
|   follow him will lay down their life take
|   up their cross and follow
|   [Music]
|   him this is not a Works based gospel
|   works are never the means by which we
|   are saved works are not something that
|   ever keep us saved this is something
|   false that these people project onto
|   people that believe the true gospel but
|    rather this is the
|    result this this denial of self this
|    transformation is a result of the
|    transformation that takes place in the
|    Born Again experience it's not sinless
|    Perfection but rather it is a change of
|    affection people that deny this they
|    deny the power of the Holy Spirit they
|    deny the power of the born- again
|    experience they deny the spirit's power
|    working within the life of a Believer to
|    bring about Godly sorrow to bring about
|    repentance to bring about conviction of
|    sin and they make the false conflation
|    that if a person if a transformation has
|    to have taken place when a person is
|    born again therefore they're relying on
|    their Works to be saved or keep them
|    saved which I've already said is
|    completely
|    false now what people need to do is not
|    get caught up in looking for works all
|    over the place that's true people can so
|    readily doubt their salvation which is
|    dangerous because we are saved by the
|    finished work of Jesus Christ
|    and there are people out there who every
|    time they stumble they doubt their
|    salvation and God doesn't want this for
|    us at all it's definitely a danger
|    people can fall into but what I would
|    say to you is if you're someone who is
|    struggling with this one of the greatest
|    evidences that you are born again is the
|    fact that you are struggling with this
|    because there are people out there who
|    they don't even care about their sin
|    they they they love their sin they
|    indulge in their sin they're slaves to
|    sin if you're feeling a sorrow for a
|    grief in your
|    heart for the sin in your life then it's
|    a sign that the holy spirit is working
|    inside of you and you don't have to look
|    to those feelings you don't have to look
|    to your works just run to Jesus Christ
|    look at the cross get hold of every
|    verse that talks about how where sin
|    abounds the grace of God abounds all the
|    more how uh God showed his love for us
|    in that while we were still sinners
|    Christ died for us and just medit Med
|    itate on that and just rest in the
|    finished work of Christ that sorrow that
|    conviction for your sin is a sign that
|    you've been transformed because the
|    people out there in the world they don't
|    even experience that so friends don't
|    fall for this absolute nonsense that
|    there's a difference between being a
|    Christian and being a disciple don't
|    fall for the lies of the Blasphemous
|    cheap Grace Gospel which denies the
|    power of God
|    and which twists scripture denies
|    scripture don't fall for that the early
|    church fathers who were taught directly
|    by the apostles never believed in that
|    all of the prominent people throughout
|    church history never believed in that
|    and the scriptures most certainly do not
|    teach that it is one of the most insane
|    doctrines that you will come across I'm
|    going to put a video up on the screen
|    which goes over some of the verses that
|    shows the that there will be a
|    transformation in the life of a born-
|    again believer I'll put that on the
|    screen uh you're really going to be
|    blessed by that um if you have any
|    comments leave them below and I would
|    love to talk to you soon God bless you
|    friends
