Firstly, my measuring stick for affirming people to be in Christ is I would affirm anyone who, firstly, openly confesses Jesus Christ is the Son of God to me, secondly I would affirm anyone who is trusting on the Lord Jesus Christ, God's Only-Begotten Son for their salvation, with a will to do God's will, obedient to Jesus Christ's teaching of repentance from sin, repentance from dead work (work not done in faith), turning towards obedience and loving service towards God.

That being said, I don't affirm these opinionated 'thought-for-thought' translations of the Bible as 'Scripture':

- NLT (New Living Translation)
  - I do not consider this Bible as Scripture, because I have found that it rewrites verses entirely to suit an opinionated 'faith-mutually-excluding-obedience' theology. It may be useful as an opinionated thought-for-thought translation, but isn't in the same league as the more literal translations such as NASB, ESV, and KJV.
