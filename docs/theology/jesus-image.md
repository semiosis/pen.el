    bride. As sister said, "I'm not a
    theologian, but I am his
    bride." As I,
    by his mercy, continue to walk with
    him, and read his Holy
    Word, I began to
    discover that He is the suffering
    God. Would you close your eyes for a
    moment? This Jesus
    This, Jesus nearing the end of his
    life spreads the
    table and as the Passover Lamb
    Himself, celebrates Passover.
    In His most painful moment that's
    approaching, He longs to
    sit with his own and commune with
    them, Even with his betrayer at the
    table, Jesus still
    chooses to love his
    own, and He washes the feet of that
    betrayer knowing that in just a few
    moments that betrayer with those freshly
    washed feet will use those
    feet to betray the
    Lord. In just a moment we're going to
    receive the body and blood of Jesus and
    I believe it's going to heal many of you.
    But he takes the bread and the wine - He
    says, "Take, eat, this is my
    body that is broken for you." He takes the
    wine and says, "Take and drink. This is my
    blood that is shed for you for the
    remission of
    sin." He says, "Do this
    often in remembrance of me."
    And then he says, "Every time we do
    it, we declare the Lord's
    death until he returns."

    walks through the Kidron
    Valley. Just close your eyes right there
    and wait on the Lord as I speak to
    you. He walks through the Kidron Valley
    to Gethsemane. It was the place of retreat for
    Him, and he went to
    pray after singing the Hallel
    Psalms. Imagine singing songs that speak
    of your own death. Psalm 116, for instance. The
    scripture teaches that they sang Psalms,
    they would have been the Hallel
    Psalms. Imagine being so yielded that you
    can worship your Father with a
    song that declares your own death.
    And He gets to this
    garden, begins to
    pray, and He says,
    "Father, if it's possible, can you
    choose another way, can you take this
    cup? Nevertheless, not my will but
    thine be done." And He begins to sweat drops of
    blood. His father sends an angel to
    strengthen Him. [He] casts himself upon the
    ground as the yielded Son and
    Judas whose name means praise
    (don't think for a moment that just
    because you praise you can't betray the Lord) his name means praise and
    he shows up and greets the Lord with a
    kiss as he betrays Him.
    Friends, intimacy talk without an intimate life is
    betrayal. You can kiss Him and betray Him.
    And as sister said
    today they bound Him. And here the Lord
    offers His hands, the hands that framed
    the world, the hands that hung the stars in
    the sky, hung the moon, the
    Sun, the hands that formed Adam and Eve,
    not spoke them into existence, but loved
    them enough to form them into his own
    image, the very icon of God, the image of
    God, Jesus. With those same hands he took Adam
    close and breathed into his nostrils the
    breath of life, those same precious hands that
    healed the sick in Galilee, the same precious hands that fed
    the hungry, the same hands that delivered
    Mary Magdalene, the same hands that smeared
    mud on eyes and opened them. Now they're
    bound by his own creation. As sister said, he could have
    stopped it at any minute. But remember friends, this King
    comes to die. The serpent's head must be crushed
    by a bruising, and so He offers those
    hands, bound by His own creation, led
    down the valley that he created, God
    imprisoned by His own,
    willingly. And they led him that night to
    an illegal trial, trials at night were
    illegal, and they
    gathered, and they mocked him,
    they slapped Him, they blindfolded
    Him, they commanded that He answer their
    questions. "Tell us, are you the Son of the
    Highest?" Jesus sat there
    quietly, having his beard plucked out
    from His face. The Scripture says, "I gave
    my beard to those who plucked
    it." The Scripture says He set his chin,
    his face as
    flint. The Scripture
    says in Psalm 88, "My eyes waste away due
    to affliction because of beating and
    tears." The Sanhedrin (the elders, the
    Pharisees) beat Him
    brutally. After all, the Law
    said that the priest had to lay his
    hands on the sacrifice and transfer the
    sin of the nation and that the sacrifice
    had to be led outside the city and while
    those priests were slapping Jesus little
    did they know that He would carry their sin upon
    His own body and a transfer would take
    place - the very Lamb of God.
    And that night after this illegal trial
    eventually Jesus answers to honor the authority of the
    high priest. He said, "I adure you by the
    living God, tell us are you the Son of
    the Highest. Are you the son of David, the
    Messiah?" He said, "You are right and one
    day you will see the Son of Man seated
    at the right hand of the power coming in
    the Clouds Of Heaven." And they tore their clothes and
    said, "Blasphemy." That night they would lower
    him into a dungeon, beneath Caiaphas home. I've
    been in that dungeon. In that dungeon Psalm 88 sits on
    a pulpit and it's open to this verse:
    "Darkness was my only friend." Here the Son of Man is thrown
    into a dungeon - God himself - thrown and lowered in by ropes,
    most likely under his precious arms,
    dropped into a dungeon, spent the night
    alone. But He really wasn't alone, His
    Father there're with
    Him. After that, He's paraded to
    Pilate. Pilate says. "Send "him to Herod."
    Herod says, 'Perform for me, it's what the
    church does today, work a miracle&#x2026;
    Send me some money, make me
    famous, bless my
    business.' If you're God, prove it. Prove
    that you're God. That's the heart of Herod. Herod
    couldn't wait to see Him so He could be
    entertained. Oh why is the meeting so
    dead? That worship team's off today - it's
    the spirit of Herod.
    Jesus doesn't perform for Herod. He
    silently stands in front of him because
    He has nothing to
    prove. Herod sends him back to
    Pilate. Pilate says, "Don't you know I could
    kill you?' Jesus says, "You'd have no
    authority if it weren't given to you
    from above."
    Pilate finds no fault in
    Him. But the religious, you
    see, those who knew scripture without
    seeing Jesus use the scriptures to kill
    Him. Blasphemy, they
    said. They demanded that Pilate kill Him. Prior to that Pilate
    says, "No, no I will have him flogged." And
    so here Jesus, His beard has been plucked,
    His eyes are wasting away, His face is
    swollen. He's bruised and
    blooded, and they strip Him
    and tie Him to a pole, chain Him to a
    pole. There was no need to chain Him, He
    would have held on. After all He's crucified before the
    foundations of the world, the one who
    comes to lay His life down. No need to
    chain Him to that pole. He said to the
    Israelites, "I am the Lord who heals
    you." Nonetheless, he receives the shame of
    being bound to this pole and He's
    stripped down and God offers his back to
    the smiters. Isaiah writes,
    "They plowed my back like long furrows,
    like plowing the land." They plowed his
    back, His Holy
    Blood, His perfect
    Blood, His healing Blood.
    His saving
    Blood. His Blood that speaks a better
    word than that of Abel is pouring out of His body as they
    lashed Him with the cat of nine
    tals. His bones are showing, some of His organs exposed, He's
    offering His very back so that we would
    be healed tonight.
    His mother is watching, John is
    watching the other Mary's watching as the Holy One of
    Israel is being skinned by the cat of nine tales.
    They took a crown of thorns. Friends, this is thethe
    one who wore Heaven's diadem, the one who's
    stripped naked is the one whose robe filled the
    temple with glory, and they took this crown of thorns,
    you see they had to, He had to redeem the
    curse so that you could have the mind of
    Christ tonight. After all, don't don't you
    remember that the fire in
    Exodus is in the midst of a bush and the
    bush isn't consumed? Stephen says in Acts 7 that
    that's a thorn bush don't you see the picture? Now the
    one who is an all consuming fire is
    wearing thorns. Why is he wearing Thorns? Because
    this is a different Kingdom.
    This is a Holy Kingdom. This is the kingdom of
    humility. This is the kingdom of offering
    self. This is the kingdom of
    bleeding. This is the kingdom of
    sacrifice. This is the kingdom of foot
    washing. This is the kingdom of carrying
    our cross. And as though it were not
    enough to place the crown, they beat the
    thorns in with a read.
    
    **Mark 15:17-19** - And they clothed him in a purple cloak, and twisting together a crown of thorns, they put it on him. And they began to salute him, Hail, King of the Jews! And they were striking his head with a reed and spitting on him and kneeling down in homage to him. (ESV)
    
    The one who held Heaven's septer has thorns
    implanted piercing his skull and His
    precious face, the face that 2
    Corinthians 4 says is the very glory of
    God whose face shines upon
    us, whose face shines brighter than the
    Sun. They beat that Crown into His beautiful
    face and they spit on Him. The Bible says
    an entire garrison spit on Him. A Garrison, dozens
    of soldiers spitting on this Holy
    God, and in that moment, friends please
    listen, in that moment upon that Holy
    face, that beautiful
    face, that face that looks at you tonight
    and loves you. In that
    moment, the worst man could
    offer and the best God could offer
    collided on the face of
    Jesus. What do you mean, Michael? The
    spittle of the Gentiles collided with the blood of the
    Passover Lamb. All upon the face of
    Jesus and I'm here to tell you
    tonight by the authority of the Holy
    Word of God that God won, that the Blood
    prevails and the Blood speaks
    today. The worst man can offer bows its
    knee to the Holy Blood of Jesus
    Christ. And this Jesus is led to Pilate, flogged, skinned,
    standing before the Elders of
    Israel and Pilate says
    something, having no idea what he's
    saying. He says this, as they look
    on this beaten bruised
    bloodied, mocked abused, God man,
    Pilate makes a declaration, "Behold, the
    man." Here, Jesus suffering and dying and
    bleeding shows us what it is to be a
    man, shows us what it is to be fully
    alive." It is to be mocked, it is to bleed
    out, it is to lay your life down. It is to
    trade what is glorious for the honor of your
    Father. And sympathy was not flowing from
    His own as the Scripture says in John 1.
    He came to his own Israel and his own
    did not receive Him, but as many as received
    Him, to them He gave the right to become
    children of God, to those who believe in
    His name. And there Jesus is standing
    before His own. They were not filled with compassion,
    they said, "Crucify Him! More, more pain.
    Crucify Him! Crucify the Passover Lamb."
    Even though He broke us out of Egypt's
    bondage. Even though it was His Holy idea
    to mark our homes with blood so the
    death angel would pass over. Kill Him,
    kill the Lord.  And Jesus took this
    cross like all of us
    must.

    those precious shoulders with no
    skin up a mountain to His own death. What
    could be worse than to carry the device
    that it's going to kill
    you? So weak was He that He couldn't go
    on, and Simon of Sirene comes to help
    Him. Listen friends, and as Simon
    identifies with the cross, Simon is now smeared with the Holy
    Blood of Jesus. Let the world mock you,
    you'll be covered in the Blood,
    should you take up your cross.
    And Jesus carries that cross up a
    mountain to the skull, the skull is the symbol of death.
    Remember it's by death that he will
    conquer death. It's through his bruising
    that He'll crush the head of the serpent.
    Death will be destroyed by the man with a capital
    M (Messiah) who's laying his life
    down, and they nail him to that cross.
    Adam failed by eating fruit from a
    living tree and sin came. Life will now
    come through the first fruits
    from the dead (Jesus) who hangs on a dead
    tree. And Jesus breathes his last and says,
    "Father, into your hands I commit my
    Spirit." Remember, He said, "No man takes my
    life, I lay it down." And in that moment
    friends, in that
    moment, in that moment the cosmos had
    never seen a man lay his own life down
    who was perfect. The devil had never seen a man
    breathe His last in perfection. And on that cross it
    said, "Jesus of Nazareth, King of the
    Jews." Why does it say that? Why was it left on the
    cross? Because in this Kingdom, as many great people have said,
    Kings carry crosses. In that
    moment, the Earth shook, the sky grew black because man
    would not mourn Him so the Rocks
    exploded. After all didn't Jesus say if they
    don't praise me the rocks will cry
    out?
    
    **Luke 19:37-40** - As he was drawing near—already on the way down the Mount of Olives—the whole multitude of his disciples began to rejoice and praise God with a loud voice for all the mighty works that they had seen, saying, Blessed is the King who comes in the name of the Lord! Peace in heaven and glory in the highest! And some of the Pharisees in the crowd said to him, Teacher, rebuke your disciples. He answered, I tell you, if these were silent, the very stones would cry out. (ESV)
    
    But they did, and the ground
    shook and the Holy Blood of Jesus flowed
    down that cross and they took
    Him and ran a spear through His side as
    the last Adom. From this Adam's side a bride would come
    just like the first Adam, and the lovers of Jesus after Jesus
    died would take him down from that cross
    and prepare His body as sister taught us
    today, and they would dress His
    body and wash His
    body, pour allows and mirrh upon his body.
    They brought myrrh to Him at his
    birth prophesying one day He will
    die. They took that precious body and
    laid it in a rich man's
    tomb. Here, Jesus our Sabbath is
    lying resting from all of his works.
    And he descends into the underworld and
    plunders death, hell and the
    grave, and takes captivity captive and 3
    days later the ground breaks open and
    the Saints come up with
    Him, and the King of Glory
    emerges. Death could not hold Him, the
    ground could not hold Him. As the
    scripture says, "You will not allow your
    Holy One to see
    corruption." You'll not allow the Holy One
    to see corruption.
    You see it's only for sinners who
    return to dust, but as Isaiah wrote, He's not
    wounded for His
    transgressions, He's wounded for our
    transgressions. No friends, don't mistake
    this death, He didn't die because of His
    sin. He died because of our sin. And this
    Holy One broke forth on the third day. I
    said He broke forth on the third day.
    Don't you remember the creation account where the
    Scripture says that it's on the third
    day that the seed broke the
    ground and began to appear. It's all
    about Jesus, friends, all of it. 40 Days Later
    he ascends to the highest
    height. Today He seated at the right hand
    of the Father, yearning to come
    back and take us
    home where we see Him and shall be like
    Him and to feed us
    of Himself as the Heavenly
    servant at the table of the marriage
    supper of the Lamb.

    please. Without anyone moving.
    Please close your
    eyes. There are no altar calls in the
    Bible. I doesn't matter if you've
    been to one. What matters is are you married and
    in love with the one I just spoke
    about? Have you ever heard the
    Gospel, or did you just get to know Him
    because he has a great plan for your
    life, you figured you'd follow Him
    occasionally? Do not risk your
    eternity. This event does not guarantee
    your eternity. Only a life found in
    Jesus offers us eternal security. If you feel the pull of the
    Holy Spirit, if you're living a life that
    is in and out, if you're living a life of
    sin, you don't have to, that's a
    lie. Of course you'll sin occasionally
    but it shouldn't be your
    lifestyle. It's a
    lie. The blood of Jesus is stronger than
    any demonic force over your
    life, any habit. Jesus said he who sins is a slave
    to sin. He said whom the Son sets free is
    free indeed.

    It's time to
    turn. Don't just turn away from your sin
    tonight, turn away from your sin to the
    Lord Jesus. I want us all to pray out loud. I
    know we've gone a little extra tonight,
    but it's the last night and Jesus is happy right now. He
    feels loved. That's
    wonderful, that's wonderful. What can we
    offer Him but our
    love? Can we all pray this out
    loud, "Heavenly Father, wash me in your blood, cleanse my soul,
    forgive my sin, You Are Holy and I have grieved you.
    I have broken your heart and I'm sorry Lord.
    I really am sorry. Wash me
    tonight with the blood of Jesus. You
    said, though my sins be of
    scarlet they shall be white as snow.
    Tonight I confess my sin and you
    promised that if I would confess my
    sin, You are faithful and
    just to forgive my sin and cleanse
    me from all unrighteousness. Tonight I turn from this
    world, I renounce the devil, I renounce my own will
    will and I give myself to you as you have fully
    given yourself to
    me. Make me your bride 
    I declare and I believe that
    Jesus Christ is the Son of
    the Living God, born of the Virgin,
    lived a perfect and Holy life,
    suffered upon the cross,
    shed his Precious Blood, died and was buried,
    and raised again.
    You are the son of the Living
    God, the King of Kings and the Lord of
    Lords and tonight I give my life to you. Find me
    ready Lord
    when you
    return. In Jesus' precious
    name, AMEN!!
