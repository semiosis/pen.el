Vision: Sacred heart of Jesus, Technology and God's Army

Jul 3, 2022

The Calling

I believe it is my calling to help people to find their identity in Jesus due
to AI technology making it more difficult.

The issue is illusion. There’s a reason, I think, that God’s grace came to me
through Valentinianism. It’s because the Valentinians understood that sin is
falsehood and illusion, and Jesus heals/restores our spirits.

The vision

This year I’ve had 3 astral projections (bridal chamber) and 4 visions, which I
have documented along with dreams, some of them Holy Spirit dreams.

• Dream Resume // Bodacious Blog

It’s been simultaneously my Holy Spirit baptism and the Father giving me my
calling.

This is one of those visions.

Description

A most red swallowtail flag, red on top, blue as the bottom half stripe I
think, rolled around a pole, with white on the flag too I think.

The words "St John 2 June/July 2000 - A very strong force indeed" were written
on the flag.

There was something value I remember also before seeing the flag. I was trying
to build something. However, upon seeing the flag I though ‘This has already
been built for me; The flag, that is’. But this is the year 2000 I thought! Was
it possibly me who built this flag back then?

The most clear message - The Sacred Heart of Jesus

• Angelus, 2 July 2000 | John Paul II

This is the most clear message from my dream. The precise date which it said.

In a society where technology and informatics are developing at a growing rate,
where people are caught up in thousands of often conflicting interests, they
risk losing their centre, the centre of their very selves.

The flag and message I think refer to God’s army

They are expertly trained like no other army on earth.

They are more supernaturally powerful than any other army on earth.

These soldiers are led by the most powerful leadership that ever existed, Jesus
the son of God.

2 Corinthians 10:3
3 For though we live in the world, we do not wage war as the world does. 4 The
weapons we fight with are not the weapons of the world. On the contrary, they
have divine power to demolish strongholds. 5 We demolish arguments and every
pretension that sets itself up against the knowledge of God, and we take
captive every thought to make it obedient to Christ.

Angel radio, I think

As I was watching the dream, I would become sure it was of profound
significance, waves of vibrations would go through my, my eyelids would
flutter.

The two-pointed red, white and blue flag

I do not know what it means, but I will take some interpretations from flags.

I also had a strong sense of the country Chile being important. I know they’re
suffering a drought right now.

Colours

colour                russia meaning                        usa meaning
white  nobility and frankness                       purity and innocence
blue   faithfulness, honesty, impeccability, and    vigilance, perseverance and
chastity                                     justice.
red    for courage, generosity, and love.           hardiness and valor

The white triangle stands for equality and fraternity; the blue field for
peace, truth and justice; and red field for patriotism and valor.

A lot of countries have these colours.

Messages from John Paul II during 2 June to 2 July, 2000

All posts from John Paul II

• Angelus / Regina Caeli 2000 | John Paul II

Solemnity of the Sacred Heart of Jesus

• Angelus, 2 July 2000 | John Paul II

This is the most clear message from my dream. The precise date which it said.

1 The Heart of Jesus contains a message for
2 everyone; it also speaks to today's world.
3
4 In a society where technology and informatics
5 are developing at a growing rate, where people
6 are caught up in thousands of often
7 conflicting interests, they risk losing their
8 centre, the centre of their very selves.
9
10 By showing us his Heart, Jesus reminds us
11 first of all that it is there, deep within
12 himself, that each person's destiny is
13 decided, his death or life in the definitive
14 sense.
15
16 He himself gives us life in abundance, which
17 allows our hearts, sometimes hardened by
18 indifference and selfishness, to be opened to
19 a higher form of life.

Solemnity of the Holy Apostles Peter and Paul

• Angelus, 29 June 2000 | John Paul II
• Struggle against poverty
• Holy Apostles Peter and Paul, considered the pillars of the universal
Church

The Eucharistic Mystery

• Angelus, 25 June 2000 | John Paul II
• In the Eucharistic mystery the Risen One, in fact, has wished to continue
dwelling in our midst, so that every human being can know his true name,
his true face, and experience his boundless mercy.
• Christ is the only Saviour of the world.
• He is the Mediator of the new and eternal Covenant (cf. Heb 9: 15),
which fulfilled the Covenant God made on Sinai with the chosen people.
• It is a Covenant open to all peoples, in view of the great
eschatological banquet foretold by the prophets of Israel.
• In the light of this truth, the Church does not scorn what human
beings do in their various religious expressions to approach God
and to be purified by him; instead she encourages fruitful
interreligious dialogue.
• Interreligious dialogue!
• At the same time, however, she cannot fail to state clearly that
Christ is the only Redeemer, the Son of God, who became incarnate
for us, died and rose again.

Solemnity of Pentecost: Upper room

• Angelus, 18 June 2000, Solemnity of the Holy Trinity | John Paul II

• The first miraculous outpouring of the Holy Spirit on the Apostles.

Solemnity of Pentecost: Upper room. The successors of the Apostles

• Regina Coeli, 11 June 2000, Pentecost | John Paul II

1 One, because the Spirit made the Church a
2 mystery of communion, an icon on earth of the
3 Most Holy Trinity; holy, because the Spirit
4 preserves in her members the holiness of
5 Christ the Head; catholic, because the Spirit
6 spurs her to proclaim the one Gospel of
7 salvation to all peoples; apostolic, because
8 through the ministry of the Apostles and their
9 successors the Spirit guides her on the paths
10 of history.

• Jesus’ Ascension

1 Today the feast of Jesus' Ascension into
2 heaven is being celebrated in many countries,
3 including Italy.
4
5 Forty days after his Resurrection, he was
6 lifted up before his disciples' eyes and a
7 cloud took him from their sight (cf. Acts 1: 9).
8
9 Jesus' public life ended in this way and the
10 Church's missionary expansion began.
11
12 From that day, Christ's disciples started to
13 spread the Word of salvation everywhere,
14 bearing witness to the Death and Resurrection
15 of their divine Master.
16
17 Today the Church continues on this path,
18 proclaiming the Gospel to the people of our
19 time and telling everyone that our true,
20 definitive homeland is not here below but "in
21 the heavens", that is, in God.
22
23 However, this must not deter us from our
24 involvement in the world, instead - as the
25 lives of the saints show - it must strengthen
26 it even more.
27
28 Only by completing our mission on earth will
29 we finally be able to enter into God's glory.
30
31 2.
32
33 To proclaim and bear witness to Christ! This
34 is the mission of every baptized person.
35
36 This mission is referred to directly by the
37 World Day of Social Communications, which is
38 being celebrated today and whose theme is:
39 "Proclaiming Christ in the media at the dawn
40 of the new millennium".
