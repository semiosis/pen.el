** Question

I'd like to understand the Greek behind the phrase _in the teaching of Christ_.
Because I'm interested in whether the phrase _teaching of Christ_ refers to the teachings that Christ
taught including His teachings before His death, burial and resurrection, or
if it the phrase is also talking about the doctrine surrounding what is known about Christ.
My guess is both, but I'd like to understand the Greek a bit better.

  *II John 1:9* - Everyone who goes on ahead and does not abide _in the teaching ([[https://biblehub.com/greek/1321.htm][G1322 didachē]]) of Christ_, does not have God. Whoever abides in the teaching has both the Father and the Son. (ESV)

And behold, I am with you always, to the end of the age. (ESV)

  *II Timothy 4:3* - For the time is coming when people will not endure sound teaching ([[https://biblehub.com/greek/1319.htm][G1319 didaskalias]]), but having itching ears they will accumulate for themselves teachers to suit their own passions, (ESV)

  *I Timothy 6:1* - Let all who are under a yoke as slaves regard their own masters as worthy of all honor, so that the name of God and the teaching ([[https://biblehub.com/greek/1319.htm][G1319 didaskalia]]) may not be reviled. (ESV)

  *I Timothy 6:3* - If anyone teaches a different doctrine and does not agree with the sound words of our Lord Jesus Christ and the teaching ([[https://biblehub.com/greek/1319.htm][G1319 didaskalia]]) that accords with godliness, (ESV)

  *John 7:16-17* - So Jesus answered them, My teaching ([[https://biblehub.com/greek/1321.htm][G1322 didachē]]) is not mine, but his who sent me. If anyone's will is to do God's will, he will know whether the teaching is from God or whether I am speaking on my own authority. (ESV)

Christ's teaching is life and peace.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *Malachi 2:4-9* - So shall you know that I have sent this command to you, that my covenant with Levi may stand, says the LORD of hosts. My covenant with him was one of life and peace, and I gave them to him. It was a covenant of fear, and he feared me. He stood in awe of my name. True instruction was in his mouth, and no wrong was found on his lips. He walked with me in peace and uprightness, and he turned many from iniquity. For the lips of a priest should guard knowledge, and people should seek instruction from his mouth, for he is the messenger of the LORD of hosts. But you have turned aside from the way. You have caused many to stumble by your instruction. You have corrupted the covenant of Levi, says the LORD of hosts, and so I make you despised and abased before all the people, inasmuch as you do not keep my ways but show partiality in your instruction. (ESV)

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *John 6:63* - It is the Spirit who gives life; the flesh is of no avail. The words that I have spoken to you are spirit and life. (ESV)
#+END_QUOTE

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *Romans 8:1-15* - There is therefore now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus. For the law of the Spirit of life has set you free in Christ Jesus from the law of sin and death. For God has done what the law, weakened by the flesh, could not do. By sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh and for sin, he condemned sin in the flesh, in order that the righteous requirement of the law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not according to the flesh but according to the Spirit. For those who live according to the flesh set their minds on the things of the flesh, but those who live according to the Spirit set their minds on the things of the Spirit. To set the mind on the flesh is death, but to set the mind on the Spirit is life and peace. For the mind that is set on the flesh is hostile to God, for it does not submit to God's law; indeed, it cannot. Those who are in the flesh cannot please God. You, however, are not in the flesh but in the Spirit, if in fact the Spirit of God dwells in you. Anyone who does not have the Spirit of Christ does not belong to him. But if Christ is in you, although the body is dead because of sin, the Spirit is life because of righteousness. If the Spirit of him who raised Jesus from the dead dwells in you, he who raised Christ Jesus from the dead will also give life to your mortal bodies through his Spirit who dwells in you. So then, brothers, we are debtors, not to the flesh, to live according to the flesh. For if you live according to the flesh you will die, but if by the Spirit you put to death the deeds of the body, you will live. For all who are led by the Spirit of God are sons of God. For you did not receive the spirit of slavery to fall back into fear, but you have received the Spirit of adoption as sons, by whom we cry, Abba! Father! (ESV)

** Grammatical Case

#+BEGIN_SRC text -n :async :results verbatim code :lang text
  interrogative
      /ˌɪntəˈrɒɡətɪv/
      adjective
      having the force of a question.
      "a hard, interrogative stare"

  transitive verb
      A verb that entails one or more transitive
      objects, for example, 'enjoys' in Amadeus

      This contrasts with intransitive verbs,
      which do not entail transitive objects,
      for example, 'arose' in Beatrice arose.
