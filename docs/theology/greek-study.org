** Question

I'd like to understand the Greek behind the phrase _in the teaching of Christ_.
Because I'm interested in whether the phrase _teaching of Christ_ refers to the teachings that Christ
taught including His teachings before His death, burial and resurrection, or
if it the phrase is also talking about the doctrine surrounding what is known about Christ.
My guess is both, but I'd like to understand the Greek a bit better.

  *II John 1:9* - Everyone who goes on ahead and does not abide _in the teaching ([[https://biblehub.com/greek/1321.htm][G1322 didachē]]) of Christ_, does not have God. Whoever abides in the teaching has both the Father and the Son. (ESV)

And behold, I am with you always, to the end of the age. (ESV)

  *II Timothy 4:3* - For the time is coming when people will not endure sound teaching ([[https://biblehub.com/greek/1319.htm][G1319 didaskalias]]), but having itching ears they will accumulate for themselves teachers to suit their own passions, (ESV)

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *I Timothy 6:1* - Let all who are under a yoke as slaves regard their own masters as worthy of all honor, so that the name of God and the teaching ([[https://biblehub.com/greek/1319.htm][G1319 didaskalia]]) may not be reviled. (ESV)

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *I Timothy 6:3* - If anyone teaches a different doctrine and does not agree with the sound words of our Lord Jesus Christ and the teaching ([[https://biblehub.com/greek/1319.htm][G1319 didaskalia]]) that accords with godliness, (ESV)

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *Romans 6:17-18* - But thanks be to God, that you who were once slaves of sin have become obedient from the heart to the standard of teaching ([[https://biblehub.com/greek/1322.htm][G1322 didachēs]]) to which you were committed, and, having been set free from sin, have become slaves of righteousness. (ESV)

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *John 7:16-17* - So Jesus answered them, My teaching ([[https://biblehub.com/greek/1321.htm][G1322 didachē]]) is not mine, but his who sent me. If anyone's will is to do God's will, he will know whether the teaching is from God or whether I am speaking on my own authority. (ESV)

** Logon - listened to His _word/s_ is a better translation here

** Grammatical Case

#+BEGIN_SRC text -n :async :results verbatim code :lang text
  interrogative
      /ˌɪntəˈrɒɡətɪv/
      adjective
      having the force of a question.
      "a hard, interrogative stare"

  transitive verb
      A verb that entails one or more transitive
      objects, for example, 'enjoys' in Amadeus
      enjoys music.

      This contrasts with intransitive verbs,
      which do not entail transitive objects,
      for example, 'arose' in Beatrice arose.
