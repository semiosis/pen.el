This makes Jesus the guarantor of a better
covenant.

The former priests were many in number,
because they were prevented by death from
continuing in office, but he holds his
priesthood permanently, because he continues
forever.

Consequently, he is able to save to the
uttermost those who draw near to God through
him, since he always lives to make
intercession for them.

For it was indeed fitting that we should have
such a high priest, holy, innocent, unstained,
separated from sinners, and exalted above the
heavens.

He has no need, like those high priests, to
offer sacrifices daily, first for his own sins
and then for those of the people, since he did
this once for all when he offered up himself.

For the law appoints men in their weakness as
high priests, but the word of the oath, which
came later than the law, appoints a Son who
has been made perfect forever.

And I tell you, you are Peter, and on this
rock I will build my church, and the gates of
hell shall not prevail against it.

I will give you the keys of the kingdom of
heaven, and whatever you bind on earth shall
be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on
earth shall be loosed in heaven.

For you have rejected your people, the house
of Jacob, because they are full of things from
the east and of fortune-tellers like the
Philistines, and they strike hands with the
children of foreigners.

Their land is filled with silver and gold, and
there is no end to their treasures; their land
is filled with horses, and there is no end to
their chariots.

Their land is filled with idols; they bow down
to the work of their hands, to what their own
fingers have made.
