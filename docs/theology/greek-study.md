# NT Greek study


## Question

I'd like to understand the Greek behind the phrase <span class="underline">in the teaching of Christ</span>.
Because I'm interested in whether the phrase <span class="underline">teaching of Christ</span> refers to the teachings that Christ
taught including His teachings before His death, burial and resurrection, or
if it the phrase is also talking about the doctrine surrounding what is known about Christ.
My guess is both, but I'd like to understand the Greek a bit better.

> **II John 1:9** - Everyone who goes on ahead and does not abide <span class="underline">in the teaching ([G1322 didachē](https://biblehub.com/greek/1321.htm)) of Christ</span>, does not have God. Whoever abides in the teaching has both the Father and the Son. (ESV)


## Didache

> **Matthew 28:19-20** - Go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, teaching ([G1321 didaskontes](https://biblehub.com/greek/1321.htm)) them to observe all that I have commanded you. And behold, I am with you always, to the end of the age. (ESV)

> **II Timothy 4:3** - For the time is coming when people will not endure sound teaching ([G1319 didaskalias](https://biblehub.com/greek/1319.htm)), but having itching ears they will accumulate for themselves teachers to suit their own passions, (ESV)

> **I Timothy 6:1** - Let all who are under a yoke as slaves regard their own masters as worthy of all honor, so that the name of God and the teaching ([G1319 didaskalia](https://biblehub.com/greek/1319.htm)) may not be reviled. (ESV)

> **I Timothy 6:3** - If anyone teaches a different doctrine and does not agree with the sound words of our Lord Jesus Christ and the teaching ([G1319 didaskalia](https://biblehub.com/greek/1319.htm)) that accords with godliness, (ESV)

> **Romans 6:17-18** - But thanks be to God, that you who were once slaves of sin have become obedient from the heart to the standard of teaching ([G1322 didachēs](https://biblehub.com/greek/1322.htm)) to which you were committed, and, having been set free from sin, have become slaves of righteousness. (ESV)

> **John 7:16-17** - So Jesus answered them, My teaching ([G1322 didachē](https://biblehub.com/greek/1321.htm)) is not mine, but his who sent me. If anyone's will is to do God's will, he will know whether the teaching is from God or whether I am speaking on my own authority. (ESV)


## Logon - listened to His <span class="underline">word/s</span> is a better translation here

> **Luke 10:39** - And she had a sister called Mary, who sat at the Lord's feet and listened to his teaching ([G3056 logon](https://biblehub.com/greek/3056.htm)). (ESV)


## Grammatical Case

     1  interrogative
     2      /ˌɪntəˈrɒɡətɪv/
     3      adjective
     4      having the force of a question.
     5      "a hard, interrogative stare"
     6  
     7  transitive verb
     8      A verb that entails one or more transitive
     9      objects, for example, 'enjoys' in Amadeus
    10      enjoys music.
    11  
    12      This contrasts with intransitive verbs,
    13      which do not entail transitive objects,
    14      for example, 'arose' in Beatrice arose.
