This document has been a work in progress. I have been born-again and have done my own Bible study, and I'm happy with what I have written here.
I'm trying to speak the truth in mercy. This document shows my current understanding at the time of writing.

I agree whole heartedly with Keith Green here:

I agree whole heartedly also with MP Nick Fletcher:

I agree whole heartedly with John Piper here:

* My thoughts and bible references regarding theology
I've been thinking about belief, faith, works, law and receiving *the Holy Spirit*!
Please let me know what you think if you have the time.

I'm trying to get clearer on this.
Please feel free to discuss it with me.

** Bible versions used in this document

Almost all of verses are taken from the ESV
(English Standard Version) bible with the odd NASB
(New American Standard Bible), KJV (King
James Version), and BSB (Berean Study Bible) used here and there.

By default I will use the ESV and where it is
not from the ESV, I have almost certainly marked it with the alternative version used.

* Being born-again
I believe we are set free from being condemned by / under the Mosaic Law to become a slave to Christ Jesus under grace.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *Romans 8:1-2* - There is therefore now no condemnation for those _who are in Christ Jesus._ For the law of the Spirit of life has set you free in Christ Jesus from the law of sin and death. (ESV)
#+END_QUOTE

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *Romans 15:17-18* - In Christ Jesus, then, I have reason to be proud of my work for God. For I will not venture to speak of anything except what Christ has accomplished through me to bring the Gentiles to *obedience—by word and deed,*
#+END_QUOTE

In Christ Jesus there is freedom from things which were bad for us, including selfishness, sin and death:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *II Corinthians 3:17* - Now the Lord is the Spirit, and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom. (ESV)
#+END_QUOTE

I believe this. If anyone is trusting that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, then they have life in His name. That doesn't mean they have come to know Him yet.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *John 20:31* - but these are written so that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that by believing you may have life in his name. (ESV)
#+END_QUOTE

Belief in Jesus Christ turns to obedience, and imitating Christ:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *John 14:12* - Truly, truly, I say to you, whoever believes in me will also do the works that I do; and greater works than these will he do, because I am going to the Father. (ESV)
#+END_QUOTE

To know Jesus, we must obey His commandments.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *I John 2:4* - Whoever says I know him but does not keep his commandments is a liar, and the truth is not in him,
#+END_QUOTE

We have to put sin away after we come to believe in Him:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *Colossians 3:5-10* - Put to death therefore what is earthly in you: sexual immorality, impurity, passion, evil desire, and covetousness, which is idolatry. On account of these the wrath of God is coming. In these you too once walked, when you were living in them. But now you must put them all away: anger, wrath, malice, slander, and obscene talk from your mouth. Do not lie to one another, seeing that you have put off the old self with its practices and have put on the new self, which is being renewed in knowledge after the image of its creator.
#+END_QUOTE

A new creation lives for Christ:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *II Corinthians 5:14-17* - For the love of Christ controls us, because we have concluded this: that one has died for all, therefore all have died; and _he died for all, that those who live might no longer live for themselves but for him_ who for their sake died and was raised. From now on, therefore, we regard no one according to the flesh. Even though we once regarded Christ according to the flesh, we regard him thus no longer. Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation. The old has passed away; behold, the new has come.
#+END_QUOTE

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *Matthew 20:27-28* - and whoever would be first among you must be your slave, even as the Son of Man came not to be served but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many. (ESV)
#+END_QUOTE

We must be in Christ Jesus. Those who have been born-again have become obedient to Jesus Christ. We must be born-again. This is Scripture and trumps my own thoughts. I affirm these verses wholeheartedly:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *II Corinthians 5:17* - Therefore, *if* anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation. The old has passed away; behold, the new has come.
#+END_QUOTE

A *new creation* has _faith working through love_ and _keeps Jesus Christ's commandments_:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *Galatians 6:15* - For neither _circumcision counts for anything, nor uncircumcision,_ but *a new creation.* (ESV)
#+END_QUOTE

- [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuQ_IhzVl1A][Steve Apirana - Born Again - YouTube]]

Out with the old selfish self and in with the new selflessly loving self:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *Galatians 5:6* - For in Christ Jesus _neither circumcision nor uncircumcision counts for anything,_ but only *faith working through love.* (ESV)
#+END_QUOTE

Out with the old selfish self and in with the new selflessly loving self:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *I Corinthians 7:19* - For _neither circumcision counts for anything nor uncircumcision,_ but *keeping the commandments of God.* (ESV)
#+END_QUOTE

That's because God gives us a new spirit to obey Him:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *Ezekiel 11:19-20* - And I will give them one heart, and a new spirit I will put within them. I will remove the heart of stone from their flesh and give them a heart of flesh, that they may walk in my statutes and keep my rules and obey them. And they shall be my people, and I will be their God. (ESV)
#+END_QUOTE

We can repent from sin as an act of obedient faith to God:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *Jeremiah 4:4* - Circumcise yourselves to the LORD; remove the foreskin of your hearts, O men of Judah and inhabitants of Jerusalem; lest my wrath go forth like fire, and burn with none to quench it, because of the evil of your deeds. (ESV)
#+END_QUOTE

What God does by way of initiative and what we do as a response is inextricably woven together [to the point where our obedience and God's work may be indistinguishable]. God turns our enmity to love and our disbelief to faith:

[[https://youtu.be/D70xSncZBDI?t=2052][Born Again - Alistair Begg, Parkside Church - YouTube]]

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *Philippians 2:13* - for it is *God who works in you, both to will and to work* for his good pleasure. (ESV)
#+END_QUOTE

*Paul toils*, _struggling with all God's energy_ that *God works* powerfully within him:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *Colossians 1:29* - For this *I toil, struggling* _with all_ *his energy that he powerfully works within me.* (ESV)
#+END_QUOTE

Father God in Jesus was also doing His work through Jesus:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *John 14:10* - Do you not believe that I am in the Father, and the Father is in Me? The words that I say to you I do not speak on My own initiative, but the Father abiding in Me does His works. (NASB)
#+END_QUOTE

Here it is further echoed by Paul that though these people were acting of their own free will, they were doing God's will:

Paul commends _giving oneself to others by the will of God_ (their will was doing God's will):

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *II Corinthians 8:3-5* - For they gave /according to their means/, as I can testify, and /beyond their means/, *of their own free will*, begging us earnestly for the favor of taking part in the relief of the saints— and this, not as we expected, but they _gave themselves first to the Lord_ and *then by the will of God to us.* (ESV)
#+END_QUOTE

Paul commends both desiring to do the will of God, and then encourages to complete the work they desire to do, but says that *if the will (obedience of heart) is there, it is acceptable* according to what a person has:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *II Corinthians 8:10-12* - And in this matter I give my judgment: this benefits you, who a year ago started _not only to do this work_ but *also to desire to do it*. So now _finish doing it as well_, so that your *readiness in desiring it may be matched by your completing it* out of what you have. For if the readiness is there, it is acceptable according to what a person has, not according to what he does not have. (ESV)
#+END_QUOTE

In "[[https://youtu.be/La7TpqSmuJk][The Blazing Center: Part 3 - YouTube]]" John Piper says, "Maybe my will could correspond to God's will so I could do His will and it would be my will?!" I agree with him.

And through our obedience to Jesus we are saved. The Bible is clear - a works-based gospel based on God working through us saves:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *Hebrews 5:8-9* - Although he was a son, he learned obedience through what he suffered. And being made perfect, he became the source of eternal salvation to all who obey him, (ESV)
#+END_QUOTE

It's actually a faith-based gospel, and the works are a gift. So believing, obedient faith comes first and God works in us to change our heart to be transformed to love in the likeness of Jesus:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *Ephesians 2:8-10* - For by grace you have been saved through faith. And this is not your own doing; it is the gift of God, not a result of works, so that no one may boast. For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God prepared beforehand, that we should walk in them. (ESV)
#+END_QUOTE

Therefore, we teach people to both believe and to obey the Gospel. Both are required, but the success of our work doesn't count for our righteousness.

We get Jesus' words into us, believe them and obey them, feed on them, get Jesus' spirit and life into us.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *John 6:63* - It is the Spirit who gives life; the flesh is of no avail. The words that I have spoken to you are spirit and life. (ESV)
#+END_QUOTE

We rest in believing what Jesus has accomplished on our behalf, but our heart should have become obedient to Jesus.

Work flowing from obedience is still totally by grace because we needed Jesus to obey God perfectly first! We must still obey Jesus.

Believing in Jesus should result in continued loving obedience to Jesus (following Jesus), and doing the work which is similar to the work that Jesus did:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *John 14:12* - Truly, truly, I say to you, whoever believes in me will also do the works that I do; and greater works than these will he do, because I am going to the Father. (ESV)
#+END_QUOTE

I think works that we can expect to come from believers in Jesus are:
- helping to bring about the obedience of faith
- loving selflessly while not breaking faith with God

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *John 13:34-35* - A new commandment I give to you, that you love one another: just as I have loved you, you also are to love one another. By this all people will know that you are my disciples, if you have love for one another. (ESV)
#+END_QUOTE

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *John 14:10-15* - Do you not believe that I am in the Father and the Father is in me? The words that I say to you I do not speak on my own authority, but _the Father who dwells in me does his works._ Believe me that I am in the Father and the Father is in me, or else believe on account of the works themselves. Truly, truly, I say to you, *whoever believes in me will also do the works that I do;* and greater works than these will he do, because I am going to the Father. Whatever you ask in my name, this I will do, that the Father may be glorified in the Son. If you ask me anything in my name, I will do it. _If you love me, you will keep my commandments._ (ESV)
#+END_QUOTE

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *John 15:13* - Greater love has no one than this, that someone lays down his life for his friends. (ESV)
#+END_QUOTE

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *John 4:32-34* - But he said to them, I have food to eat that you do not know about. So the disciples said to one another, Has anyone brought him something to eat? Jesus said to them, My food is to do the will of him who sent me and to accomplish his work. (ESV)
#+END_QUOTE

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *Romans 16:26* - but has now been disclosed and through the prophetic writings has been made known to all nations, according to _the command of the eternal God_, to bring about the *obedience of faith* — (ESV)
#+END_QUOTE

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *Romans 15:17-18* - In Christ Jesus, then, I have reason to be proud of my work for God. For I will not venture to speak of anything except what Christ has accomplished through me to bring the Gentiles to *obedience—by word and deed,*
#+END_QUOTE

** In God's mercy, we come to obedient faith and come into Christ Jesus
"At one time disobedient, but now disobedient" means we are brought to obedience.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *Romans 11:30-32* - Just as you were _at one time disobedient_ to God but now have received mercy because of their disobedience, so they too have now been disobedient in order that by the mercy shown to you they also may now receive mercy. For *God has consigned all to disobedience, that he may have mercy on all.* (ESV)
#+END_QUOTE

** Obedience is absolutely within our ability
God's commandments are not too difficult to follow:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *Deuteronomy 30:10-11* - when you obey the voice of the LORD your God, to keep his commandments and his statutes that are written in this Book of the Law, when you turn to the LORD your God with all your heart and with all your soul. For this commandment that I command you today is not too hard for you, neither is it far off. (ESV)
#+END_QUOTE

It's _perfect_ obedience which only Jesus Christ managed to reach:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *Philippians 2:8* - And being found in human form, he humbled himself by becoming obedient to the point of death, even death on a cross. (ESV)
#+END_QUOTE

We come to having obedient faith in God through obedient faith in Jesus Christ.

Jesus Christ obeyed Father God perfectly, and sinners put Him to death, and He became the source of eternal salvation to all those who obey Him:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *Hebrews 5:8-9* - Although he was a son, he learned obedience through what he suffered. And being made perfect, he became the source of eternal salvation to all who obey him, (ESV)
#+END_QUOTE

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *John 1:29* - The next day he saw Jesus coming toward him, and said, Behold, the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world! (ESV)
#+END_QUOTE

*** We are saved through Jesus Christ
We believe on Jesus Christ and receive eternal life, and we are saved through Jesus Christ. We see that Jesus Christ obeyed God perfectly and He is the light. We have our hope on Jesus to save us when we believe on Him.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *John 3:16-19* - For God so loved the world, that he gave his only Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life. For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but in order that the world might be saved through him. Whoever believes in him is not condemned, but whoever does not believe is condemned already, because he has not believed in the name of the only Son of God. And this is the judgment: the light has come into the world, and people loved the darkness rather than the light because their deeds were evil. (ESV)
#+END_QUOTE

We are not condemned if we believe in the name of Jesus Christ, the only Son of God. That's really good news!:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *John 3:18* - Whoever believes in him is not condemned, but whoever does not believe is condemned already, because he has not believed in the name of the only Son of God. (ESV)
#+END_QUOTE

*** We become obedient to Jesus
He paid the price for our sin:
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *Romans 4:25* - who was delivered up for our trespasses and raised for our justification. (ESV)
#+END_QUOTE

And we are justified and have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ, who we are following:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *Romans 5:1* - Therefore, since we have been justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ. (ESV)
#+END_QUOTE

*** Eternal life and salvation is a gift received through faith
We put our hope on Him to be our High Priest and Advocate, we obey Him as He saves us.

These should really go hand in hand:
- Believing in Jesus Christ for His finished work to receive justification and eternal life and remain in relationship with Father God and with Jesus
- Obeying Jesus Christ to be saved from the wrath of God should really go hand-in-hand.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *John 17:3* - And this is eternal life, that they know you the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom you have sent. (ESV)
#+END_QUOTE

Being justified by Jesus' blood, we are saved by Him from the wrath of God:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *Romans 5:9* - Since, therefore, we have now been justified by his blood, much more shall we be _saved by him from the wrath of God._ (ESV)
#+END_QUOTE

- Immediately we are reconciled to God by the death of His Son,
- and then we are saved from the wrath of God by His life.
- Also, we meanwhile rejoice in God through our Lord Jesus Christ

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *Romans 5:8-11* - but God shows his love for us in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us. Since, therefore, we have now been justified by his blood, much more shall we be saved by him from the wrath of God. For if while we were enemies we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son, much more, now that we are reconciled, shall we be saved by his life. More than that, we also rejoice in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom we have now received reconciliation. (ESV)
#+END_QUOTE

Jesus' act of obedience leads to:
- justification
- life
  - I believe that the life of Jesus helps us to stop sinning

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *Romans 5:18* - Therefore, as one trespass led to condemnation for all men, so one act of righteousness leads to justification and life for all men. (ESV)
#+END_QUOTE

We are saved from the wrath of God by the life of Jesus Christ. I think that's in part saying that the life of Jesus helps us to repent from sin:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *Ephesians 5:5-7* - For you may be sure of this, that everyone who is sexually immoral or impure, or who is covetous (that is, an idolater), has no inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and God. Let no one deceive you with empty words, for because of these things the wrath of God comes upon the sons of disobedience. Therefore do not associate with them;
#+END_QUOTE

We need to obey Jesus to have the life:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *John 3:36* - Whoever believes in the Son has eternal life; whoever does not obey the Son shall not see life, but the wrath of God remains on him. (ESV)
#+END_QUOTE

Being saved by Him I think involves us becoming obedient, and faithfully obeying Jesus Christ our Lord:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *Ephesians 5:5-10* - For you may be sure of this, that everyone who is sexually immoral or impure, or who is covetous (that is, an idolater), has no inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and God. Let no one deceive you with empty words, for because of these things the wrath of God comes upon the sons of disobedience. Therefore do not associate with them; for at one time you were darkness, but now you are light in the Lord. Walk as children of light (for the fruit of light is found in all that is good and right and true), and try to discern what is pleasing to the Lord.
#+END_QUOTE

** Disobedience is sin
[[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqtl-sXeTmA&ab_channel=DesiringGod][God is very happy about obedience, and listening to His word]]. *Disobedience is sin*, and *disobedience is rejecting the word of the LORD*:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *I Samuel 15:22-23* - And Samuel said, Has the LORD as great delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices, as in obeying the voice of the LORD? Behold, _to _obey is better than sacrifice__, and __to listen than the fat of rams__. For rebellion is as the sin of divination, and presumption is as iniquity and idolatry. _Because you have rejected the word of the LORD, he has also rejected you from being king._ (ESV)
#+END_QUOTE

** God makes us born-again, so we can love Him, obediently

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *John 3:7* - Do not marvel that I said to you, You must be born again. (ESV)
#+END_QUOTE

We must love Jesus:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *John 14:21* - Whoever has my commandments and keeps them, he it is who loves me. And he who loves me will be loved by my Father, and I will love him and manifest myself to him.
#+END_QUOTE

In my understanding, I consider all who are repentantly trusting in the Lord Jesus Christ, who is God the Son, for their salvation, if they are willing _turn to and obey Him_, *if Father God puts them in*, obediently trusting Jesus Christ who is their life, to be _in Christ Jesus,_ no matter what else I say in this document.

I have been just trying to figure out my theology. One God, three persons, Father, Son and Holy Spirit. I don't have the say though. God puts a person in. AMEN!!

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *I Corinthians 1:30* - But *by His doing you are in Christ Jesus,* who became to us wisdom from God, and righteousness and sanctification, and redemption, (NASB)
#+END_QUOTE

We must drop the old selfish self and allow Jesus to come in with the new obediently loving self.

Selfish people killed Jesus. Jesus was selfless. Jesus was obedient to God unto death. We identify with Christ with a death like His, to be united with Him in a resurrection like His! This is why obedience to Jesus is so important. How can a person be resurrected if they don't die? We need to die a death to be resurrected:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *Romans 6:1* - What shall we say then? Are we to continue in sin that grace may abound? By no means! How can we who died to sin still live in it? Do you not know that all of us who have been baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into his death? We were buried therefore with him by baptism into death, in order that, just as Christ was raised from the dead by the glory of the Father, we too might walk in newness of life. For *if we have been united with him in a death like his, we shall certainly be united with him in a resurrection like his*. We know that our old self was crucified with him in order that the body of sin might be brought to nothing, so that we would no longer be enslaved to sin. For one who has died has been set free from sin. Now if we have died with Christ, we believe that we will also live with him. We know that Christ being raised from the dead will never die again; death no longer has dominion over him. For the death he died he died to sin, once for all, but *the life he lives he lives to God.* So you also must consider yourselves dead to sin and alive to God in Christ Jesus.
#+END_QUOTE

Nevertheless the one who trusts in Jesus and dies will yet live. AMEN!! And the following verse, I believe actually applies to baptism (identifying with Christ in His death and resurrection)! So a nice way of reading the following is: If someone, while believing in Jesus Christ, dies to their old selfish nature to live as someone who loves selflessly, they will live, and the one who lives abiding in Jesus Christ's love, having died to their old selfish nature, and believes in Him will never die:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *John 11:25-26* - Jesus said to her, I am the resurrection and the life. Whoever believes in me, though he die, yet shall he live, and everyone who lives and believes in me shall never die. Do you believe this?
#+END_QUOTE

I like that way of thinking of it because it encapsulates both belief and obedience to Jesus - both which I think are important.

Jesus' selfless love also faithful to God. *Without breaking faith with God*, Jesus loved back his persecutors:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *Hebrews 5:8-9* - Although he was a son, he learned obedience through what he suffered. And being made perfect, he became the source of eternal salvation to all who obey him, (ESV)
#+END_QUOTE

To put it another way, while needing to fulfill the law and the prophets, he did not sin, and sinners took his life and even his clothes:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *I Peter 2:22* - He committed no sin, neither was deceit found in his mouth. (ESV)
#+END_QUOTE

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *Matthew 27:35* - And when they had crucified him, they divided his garments among them by casting lots. (ESV)
#+END_QUOTE

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *I Peter 3:17-18* - For it is better to suffer for doing good, if that should be God's will, than for doing evil. For Christ also suffered once for sins, the righteous for the unrighteous, that he might bring us to God, being put to death in the flesh but made alive in the spirit, (ESV)
#+END_QUOTE

And Jesus prayed for his persecutors:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *Luke 23:34* - And Jesus said, Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do. And they cast lots to divide his garments. (ESV)
#+END_QUOTE

Likewise, that's the type of selfless love we should have. Selfless love while trying to maintain faithfulness to God:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *I Peter 2:20* - For what credit is it if, when you sin and are beaten for it, you endure? But if when you do good and suffer for it you endure, this is a gracious thing in the sight of God. (ESV)
#+END_QUOTE

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *I Peter 4:19* - Therefore let those who suffer according to God's will entrust their souls to a faithful Creator while doing good. (ESV)
#+END_QUOTE

The purest selfless love loves while not breaking faith with God. Jesus maintained faithfulness to God while maintaining selfless love. We should endeavour to have the same mind.

# #+BEGIN_QUOTE
#   *II Timothy 1:7* - for God gave us a spirit not of fear but of *power and love and self-control.* (ESV)
# #+END_QUOTE

We are commanded to be innocent, and to bear witness of Jesus before men who persecute us:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *Matthew 10:16-18* - Behold, I am sending you out as *sheep in the midst of wolves*, so be wise as serpents and *innocent as doves*. Beware of men, for they will deliver you over to courts and flog you in their synagogues, and you will be dragged before governors and kings for my sake, to bear witness before them and the Gentiles. (ESV)
#+END_QUOTE

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  I conjecture that, effectively, =Obedience = Believing the gospel, and Selfless love= (no longer serving yourself but serving Christ. It's obeying Jesus.).

  Nevertheless, [[https://youtu.be/tqtl-sXeTmA?t=1459][where we fall short of obedience, Jesus has us covered]]. But if we are keeping Jesus' commandments then we're abiding in His love.

  Is it crucial to obey the gospel? Yes. Is that a 'works-based' gospel? If we must put a label on it, I'd describe it more of a *my-willingness-to-work-serving-Christ-based-on-Jesus'-finished-works-and-God-working-in-me-based* gospel.
#+END_QUOTE

God works in us to save us. Since obedience to God is faith, God works in us through faith:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *Philippians 1:6* - And I am sure of this, that he who began a good work in you will bring it to completion at the day of Jesus Christ. (ESV)
#+END_QUOTE

Although, we will arrive at rest:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *Heb 4:1-6* - Therefore, while the promise of entering his rest still stands, let us fear lest any of you should seem to have failed to reach it. For good news came to us just as to them, but the message they heard did not benefit them, because they were not united by faith with those who listened. For we who have believed enter that rest, as he has said, As I swore in my wrath, They shall not enter my rest, although his works were finished from the foundation of the world. For he has somewhere spoken of the seventh day in this way: And God rested on the seventh day from all his works. And again in this passage he said, They shall not enter my rest. Since therefore it remains for some to enter it, and those who formerly received the good news failed to enter because of disobedience,
#+END_QUOTE

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *Heb 4:9-11* - So then, there remains a Sabbath rest for the people of God, for whoever has entered God's rest has also rested from his works as God did from his. Let us therefore strive to enter that rest, so that no one may fall by the same sort of disobedience.
#+END_QUOTE

We work then find rest:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *Revelation of John 14:13* - And I heard a voice from heaven saying, Write this: Blessed are the dead who die in the Lord from now on. Blessed indeed, says the Spirit, that they may rest from their labors, for their deeds follow them! (ESV)
#+END_QUOTE

The natural person does not accept the things of the Spirit of God, for they are folly to him, and he is not able to understand them because they are spiritually discerned.

So I think trusting Jesus, obeying Jesus and believing Jesus' words, and believing in Him should be *true simultaneously*, because people misconstrue Jesus' words to their own destruction.

When we are believing in Jesus Christ's finished work and obeying Jesus, obeying His commandments, it is actually God who is working in us:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *Philippians 2:13* - for it is *God who works in you, both to will and to work* for his good pleasure. (ESV)

If a person serves Christ, this is not a dead works-based gospel, but is simply obeying the gospel. That person has been brought into obedience by the grace of God.

And count the patience of our Lord as salvation, just as our beloved brother Paul also wrote to you according to the wisdom given him, as he does in all his letters when he speaks in them of these matters. There are some things in them that are hard to understand, which the ignorant and unstable twist to their own destruction, as they do the other Scriptures. You therefore, beloved, knowing this beforehand, take care that you are not carried away with the error of lawless people and lose your own stability. But grow in the grace and knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. To him be the glory both now and to the day of eternity. Amen.

God is amazing. Because He made me born-again
so I could come into a relationship with Him

It's only possible through what Jesus Christ
has achieved for us on the cross.

Even having faith in God through faith in Jesus is obedience according to =Romans 16:26=. *If a person is trusting in Him when they die, they will live.*

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *Romans 16:26* - but has now been disclosed and through the prophetic writings has been made known to all nations, according to _the command of the eternal God_, to bring about the *obedience of faith* — (ESV)

Therefore, I assert that there's no *eternal* security for those who are not willing to obey Jesus, or to turn away from their sin.
Our obedience is penitent, not perfect.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *Hebrews 5:9* - And being made perfect, he became the source of eternal salvation to _all who obey him,_

Also I conclude that obeying Jesus Christ is having faith in Him.

Why then do people preach to stop 'working for God'? The problem isn't work, but that work not done in faith is sin.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *I Thessalonians 5:12-14* - We ask you, brothers, to respect those who labor among you and are over you in the Lord and admonish you, and to esteem them very highly in love because of their work. Be at peace among yourselves. And we urge you, brothers, admonish the idle, encourage the fainthearted, help the weak, be patient with them all. (ESV)
#+END_QUOTE

Work being done by God in us to sanctify us and bring us everlasting life *is* work done in faith.
So the problem isn't work (even work relating to salvation) but the problem is work that is not done in faith (i.e. dead work).

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  I believe that anyone who trusts (is trusting) in the Lord Jesus Christ for their salvation, even they have no works, but only a trusting heart, believing what Jesus said, and putting their hope in Jesus for their salvation, _repentant and willing to obey (obedient),_ theoretically are to be in Christ if God does it. I consider that obedience to Jesus and turning away from sin is essential to be found in Him. If someone dies while trusting in Him they will live. If someone trusts in Him while they live they will never die.

** Eternal security for those who follow Jesus

[[https://youtu.be/i27b4cE4xyo?t=1513][Eternal Security - Charles Spurgeon Sermon - YouTube]]

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  At the stage they trust in Jesus, they may have no work but I believe at that stage they are justified, when in their heart is obedient, trusting, believing faith in Christ who is their life. But I'm not the one to justify them, God is.
  And I assume that Jesus knows who those people are - He knows that they are His sheep, and that Father God draws those people to Him.
  And when they go through Jesus Christ, the door, they are saved.
  
  I believe that if a person trusts and believe on God in their heart, believing that they need saving and that Jesus Christ is their Lord and that Jesus Christ died for their transgressions and was raised for their justification - that they have a hearing heart and a _heart that follows Him_ - that they will be saved.
#+END_QUOTE

I simply see no enmity between trusting God for justification through the finished work of the cross by Jesus Christ and trusting God by obeying Jesus Christ. I believe that is a false dichotomy.

** Some indicators to know for SURE you are saved

[[https://youtu.be/0y-hQrI_sTA?t=779][This is how you can know for SURE that you are saved | Assurance of Salvation | Kaci Nicole - YouTube]]

For assurance of salvation, here's three indicators:
- Firstly, a change of heart according to the example from *Matt 27:43-44*.
  - the repentant thief had come to a place of humility and fear of God
  - he had an awareness of his own sin and the reality of judgement
  - he knew that it was only by Jesus, not by his own works that he could be saved
  - he affirmed the Lordship and deity of Christ
- The second thing is a hatred of one's own sin
- Thirdly, that you have kept the faith despite trials and testing

/*1. A change of heart towards humility, fear of God, belief and trust in Jesus to be saved, an awareness of one's own sin and the reality of judgement, and acknowledging Jesus' Lordship and deity:*/

All the thief could do was look to Jesus and cry out for mercy but thankfully that is all he needed. This was all that was required of him for salvation and the same is true for us.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  The thief didn't get to go learn the bible, or get baptised or begin to follow Jesus in the way that he lived, but that is not to say that those things are not important because they are.
  Those are things that God has commanded us to do, and if we love God then we should want to be obedient in doing those things. The distiction is that those things don't earn our salvation but they are the
  fruit of a heart that has truly put faith in Jesus. I think that the thief would have gone on to do those things, he just never had a chance. But you might be thinking: I don't always obey Jesus.
  I still wrestle with sin and the answer is that you won't perfectly obey Jesus. You will still have sin in your life because Jesus will be continuing to work that out in you until the day that you die.
  But if you desire to know the God of the Bible and to love God and to obey God's word, that in itself is evidence that God is at work in your heart because we cannot do those things on our own.
  Even if we aren't yet fully where we know we ought to be with those things, the fact that they're there is an indication and that we are continuing to grow in grace.

And he said to him, Truly, I say to you, today you will be with me in Paradise. (ESV)

/*2. We must have a hatred of one's own sin:*/

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  To be a Christian doesn't mean that we are without sin this side of heaven, but it does mean that we have a hatred for our own sin, that we are wrestling with the flesh that is still inside us even as Jesus is making us new, rather than being complacent over our sin.

Paul presses on to try to achieve a high level of Christlikeness, and his rational is that Jesus made him (Paul) his own (i.e. Jesus loved him),

I'm pretty convinced that what Jesus means by the following is that by giving up worldly treasure in the pursuit

Jesus' perfect example of patience in mercy towards Paul is to:
- reassure us that we can trust Jesus as we hope for the promise of eternal life to be received from Him,

  “belief” or “[[https://biblehub.com/greek/4102.htm][/pistis/]].” The
  word “/pistis/” stems from
  [[https://biblehub.com/greek/3982.htm][/peíthō/]], to persuade or be

  The Greek word /pisteuó/ carries connotations of deep trust and

And I will make of you a great nation,* and I will bless you and make your name great, so that you will be a blessing. I will bless those who bless you, and him who dishonors you I will curse, and in you all the families of the earth shall be blessed. *So Abram went, as the LORD had told him,* and Lot went with him. Abram was seventy-five years old when he departed from Haran. And Abram took Sarai his wife, and Lot his brother's son, and all their possessions that they had gathered, and the people that they had acquired in Haran, and they set out to go to the land of Canaan. *When they came to the land of Canaan,* Abram passed through the land to the place at Shechem, to the oak of Moreh. At that time the Canaanites were in the land. *Then the LORD appeared to Abram and said, To your offspring I will give this land. So he built there an altar to the LORD, who had appeared to him.* From there he moved to the hill country on the east of Bethel and pitched his tent, with Bethel on the west and Ai on the east.

*** Joy requires apostolic work
I agree whole heartedly with John Piper here:
- [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ltvYtwMef4][The Blazing Center by John Piper - YouTube]]

/*Quote from John Piper:*/

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  I'm dealing with the issue of God's
  glory and our gladness. Can they really
  be one? And I'm doing that under the
  bigger banner of "How can I spread a
  passion for the supremacy of God?" because
  I think that phrase "passion for the
  supremacy of God" pulls together the two
  things:

  1. _"passion"_ signifies /"I'm joyful"/ and
  2. _"supremacy of God"_ signifies /"he's being magnified"/.

  So my biggest longing in
  life is to be used by God to help people
  see him for who he really is in his
  magnificence, and then have emotions that
  are appropriate to that magnificence. Why
  do we watch the World Series? Why do we
  watch gymnastics when the Olympics rolls
  around? Why do we go to the Grand Canyon?
  Why do we go to the Alps? Why do we go to
  the ocean and look out over... Why do we
  want to get near bigness and beauty and
  magnificence and excellence? It's because
  that's what we were made for. We were not
  made for mirrors. So I want to be
  absolutely candid, *the Christian Life Is War* and I'm in the business of helping
  people know how to fight in the way that
  they're supposed to, namely for joy.

  There's a text in *2 Corinthians 1:24*:

  Paul says "I'm a worker for your joy" as

  yeah there are times in the ministerial
  life or the Christian Life when we're
  low. It seems like all the joy is gone we
  want to quit give up the ministry give
  up the faith, and at those moments we
  need to fight like heaven to hold on.

For you did not receive the spirit of slavery to fall back into fear, but you have received the Spirit of adoption as sons, by whom we cry, Abba! Father! The Spirit himself bears witness with our spirit that we are children of God, and if children, then heirs—heirs of God and fellow heirs with Christ, provided we suffer with him in order that we may also be glorified with him. For I consider that the sufferings of this present time are not worth comparing with the glory that is to be revealed to us. For the creation waits with eager longing for the revealing of the sons of God. For the creation was subjected to futility, not willingly, but because of him who subjected it, in hope that the creation itself will be set free from its bondage to decay and obtain the freedom of the glory of the children of God. For we know that the whole creation has been groaning together in the pains of childbirth until now. And not only the creation, but we ourselves, who have the firstfruits of the Spirit, groan inwardly as we wait eagerly for adoption as sons, the redemption of our bodies. For in this hope we were saved. Now hope that is seen is not hope. For who hopes for what he sees? But if we hope for what we do not see, we wait for it with patience.

- Turning away from sin

#+END_QUOTE

I believe =John 5:24= is a true statement and that it should not be read outside of the words Jesus said directly before it (=Whoever does not honor the Son does not honor the Father who sent him=).

We do not nullify the rest of what Jesus has commanded of and asked of us. If Jesus is your judge, then I think it's wise to take on board the rest of what Jesus has said:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *Philippians 1:15-22* - Some indeed preach Christ from envy and rivalry, but others from good will. The latter do it out of love, knowing that I am put here for the defense of the gospel. The former proclaim Christ out of rivalry, not sincerely but thinking to afflict me in my imprisonment. What then? Only that in every way, whether in pretense or in truth, Christ is proclaimed, and in that I rejoice. Yes, and I will rejoice, for I know that through your prayers and the help of the Spirit of Jesus Christ this will turn out for my deliverance, as _it is my eager expectation and hope that I will not be at all ashamed, but that with full courage now as always Christ will be honored in my body, whether by life or by death_. For to me to live is Christ, and to die is gain. _If I am to live in the flesh, that means fruitful labor for me._ Yet which I shall choose I cannot tell.

Paul and the other faithful Apostles were exhibited as last of all, like men sentenced to death for following Jesus:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *I Corinthians 4:9-13* - For I think that God has exhibited us apostles as last of all, like men sentenced to death, because we have become a spectacle to the world, to angels, and to men. We are fools for Christ's sake, but you are wise in Christ. We are weak, but you are strong. You are held in honor, but we in disrepute. To the present hour we hunger and thirst, we are poorly dressed and buffeted and homeless, and we labor, working with our own hands. When reviled, we bless; when persecuted, we endure; when slandered, we entreat. We have become, and are still, like the scum of the world, the refuse of all things. (ESV)
#+END_QUOTE

God still makes apostles and prophetic people:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *Ephesians 4:11-16* - And he gave the apostles, the prophets, the evangelists, the pastors and teachers, to equip the saints for the work of ministry, for building up the body of Christ, until we all attain to the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God, to mature manhood, to the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ, so that we may no longer be children, tossed to and fro by the waves and carried about by every wind of doctrine, by human cunning, by craftiness in deceitful schemes. Rather, speaking the truth in love, we are to grow up in every way into him who is the head, into Christ, from whom the whole body, joined and held together by every joint with which it is equipped, when each part is working properly, makes the body grow so that it builds itself up in love.

God is loving and altogether gracious:

The Lord passed before him and proclaimed, The Lord, the Lord, a God merciful and gracious, slow to anger, and abounding in steadfast love and faithfulness, keeping steadfast love for thousands, forgiving iniquity and transgression and sin, but who will by no means clear the guilty, visiting the iniquity of the fathers on the children and the children's children, to the third and the fourth generation.

  *Hebrews 10:32-39* - But recall the former days when, _after you were enlightened, you endured a hard struggle with sufferings, sometimes being publicly exposed to reproach and affliction_, and sometimes being partners with those so treated. For you had compassion on those in prison, and you joyfully accepted the plundering of your property, since you knew that you yourselves had a better possession and an abiding one. Therefore do not throw away your confidence, which has a great reward. For you have need of endurance, so that _when you have done the will of God you may receive what is promised_. For, Yet a little while, and the coming one will come and will not delay; but my righteous one shall live by faith, and if he shrinks back, my soul has no pleasure in him. But _we are not of those who shrink back and are destroyed, but of those who have faith and preserve their souls_.

I agree whole heartedly with this guy:

I believe that generally-speaking, there is no difference between being a disciple of Jesus and a Christian.

There is a transformation in the heart of a born-again Christian that involves changing allegiance towards Jesus Christ, resulting in the will to obey Jesus, and God gives us the spirit to help us to obey Him.

  *Ezekiel 11:19-20* - And I will give them one heart, and a new spirit I will put within them.

And they shall be my people, and I will be their God. (ESV)

If someone obeys Jesus they should arrive at belief in Jesus and who He is and what He has accomplished; they should accept Him:

  *John 8:42* - Jesus said to them, If God were your Father, you would love me, for I came from God and I am here. I came not of my own accord, but he sent me.

If a person believes on Jesus and what He has accomplished they should arrive at obedience, and if they want to be counted as a friend of Jesus, they certainly they *must* obey Jesus' commandments:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *John 15:10-14* - _If you keep my commandments, you will abide in my love,_ just as I have kept my Father's commandments and abide in his love. These things I have spoken to you, that my joy may be in you, and that your joy may be full. This is my commandment, that you love one another as I have loved you. Greater love has no one than this, that someone lays down his life for his friends. You are my friends _if you do what I command you._
#+END_QUOTE

I think faith in Jesus grows as both of these qualities increase.

- Those who believe in part yet do not obey the gospel, I think fall into condemnation.
- Those who obey in part yet do not believe the gospel, I think also fall into condemnation

Nevertheless, if someone believes on Him they have begun to obey Him, and so I believe they are in the Lord while they *trust in His name, Jesus Christ (Messiah) the Son of God, to be saved*, as the following applies:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *John 3:18* - Whoever believes in him is not condemned, but whoever does not believe is condemned already, because he has not believed in the name of the only Son of God. (ESV)
#+END_QUOTE

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *John 20:31* - but these are written so that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that by believing you may have life in his name. (ESV)

So if a person *is believing* (verb) in Him - I don't think they fall into condemnation, no matter how otherwise disobedient they are.
Actually, at some stage I think we have to just rest in the knowledge that it's all about what He did, as far as being saved goes, not what we've done for Him.

It's possible to follow Jesus' voice even before having come to perfect
knowledge and obedience, but Jesus *knows* His sheep. We must hear Jesus' voice, obey Him, become a slave to righteousness, following His commandments
and at its end, Jesus gives us eternal life:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *John 10:26-29* - but you do not believe because you are not part of my flock. My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me. I give them eternal life, and they will never perish, and no one will snatch them out of my hand. My Father, who has given them to me, is greater than all, and no one is able to snatch them out of the Father's hand. (ESV)
#+END_QUOTE

Jesus' sheep:
- hear Jesus' voice
- follow Him (they're being obedient)
- Jesus knows them

I believe that what this says is that at the point Jesus knows you listen to His voice and obey His voice, He counts you as one of His sheep and He will not let you go.

The righteousness that comes through having faith in Jesus Christ - faith (not mere belief) is required to have the righteousness - to be found in Jesus:

The drink is to believe that Jesus is the Christ (Messiah), the Son of God, who has come into the world:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *John 4:10-56* - Jesus answered her, If you knew the gift of God, and who it is that is saying to you, Give me a drink, you would have asked him, and he would have given you living water.

The water that I will give him will become in him a spring of water welling up to eternal life. So Jesus said to them, Truly, truly, I say to you, unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink his blood, you have no life in you. Whoever feeds on my flesh and drinks my blood has eternal life, and I will raise him up on the last day. For my flesh is true food, and my blood is true drink.

He received the sign of circumcision as a seal of the righteousness that he had by faith while he was still uncircumcised. The purpose was to make him the father of all who believe without being circumcised, so that righteousness would be counted to them as well, and to make him the father of the circumcised who are _not merely circumcised but who also walk in the footsteps of the faith that our father Abraham had before he was circumcised_.

Therefore, we should believe with an obedient heart, and obey to receive God's assurance.

I believe that every one of Jesus' sheep have a believing, obedient heart, and Jesus knows
who they are and no-one will be able to snatch them from Jesus' hand.

I personally believe that it's God's role to justify, not ours, and if we want personal assurance that we are saved, we
must seek and follow Jesus, and arrive at the door.

Abraham was obedient the entire time, even when God counted Abraham's belief as righteousness.
We should, likewise _be obedient when we believe._
Abraham was _justified when He believed with an obedient heart_ but faith was _completed by the works of faith_ and Abraham was given assurance of the blessing:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *James 2:21-23* - Was not Abraham our father justified by works when he offered up his son Isaac on the altar?

And he said to him, Truly, I say to you, today you will be with me in Paradise. (ESV)
#+END_QUOTE

In this way we must have faith in God the Father of Jesus Christ, and believe and obey Jesus because God commanded it.

According to Paul, Abraham trusted God and that trust he had meant he didn't
waver concerning the promise of God, but he grew strong in his faith as he have
glory to God.

That's right, and Abraham's faith included:
- faithfulness
- giving glory to God
- obedience
- works of faith

What I mean to say is, the trust in God that Abraham had concerning the promise
of God is exhibited plainly in Abraham's action, and was faithful, enduring,
unwavering, over an amount of time.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *Romans 4:20-25* - No distrust made him waver concerning the promise of God, but he grew strong in his faith as he gave glory to God, fully convinced that God was able to do what he had promised. That is why his faith was counted to him as righteousness. But the words it was counted to him were not written for his sake alone, but for ours also. It will be counted to us who believe in him who raised from the dead Jesus our Lord, who was delivered up for our trespasses and raised for our justification.
#+END_QUOTE

Therefore, when we trust wholeheartedly in God who has raised from the dead Jesus Christ (who is our Lord, meaning we obey Him),
and because we believe, we then inevitably produce working faith.

Our faith is exhibited plainly in our action. Our own actions and way of expressing that faith paint a unique picture, with a faith towards God
that may be expressed a little bit differently, in different works of faith, or simply keeping Jesus Christ's words and not denying His name - patient endurance.

My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me. I give them eternal life, and they will never perish, and no one will snatch them out of my hand.

If a person has an obedient and believing heart - a heart of faith - towards Jesus, then they _will be_ saved:
- If a person truthfully confesses (admits) with their mouth that Jesus is Lord, they have an obedient heart.
  - This must result in the person obeying Jesus; freely forgiving others, loving others as He loved us, _keeping Jesus' commandments_
- If they believe in their heart that God raised Jesus from the dead, they believe Jesus, and believe God who sent Him.
  - This must result in the person accepting forgiveness for sin

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *Romans 10:9* - because, if you confess with your mouth that Jesus is Lord and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved. (ESV)
#+END_QUOTE

I believe that a person does not have any _security_ of eternal salvation unless they have in their heart _obedient, believing faith_ in Jesus Christ, and even then there is often a race and a journey to receive it.

The knowledge of the truth is for those who abide in Jesus' word and follow Him:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *John 8:31-32* - So Jesus said to the Jews who had believed in him, If you abide in my word, you are truly my disciples, and you will know the truth, and the truth will set you free.
#+END_QUOTE

I believe that obedience is as intrinsic and necessary to faith as belief is.

# In other words, I believe one must make Jesus Christ their Lord *and* their Saviour for any guarantee at being saved; one must have obedient faith in the heart, not just the head.

# The _heart_ must truly believe. And a person with a believing heart is obedient to Jesus, and if they're not obedient to Jesus then they don't have a believing heart, and haven't arrived at His rest.

# That's why there's a receiving of salvation through faith and a 'reaching' of God's rest. Faith requires obedience to Jesus because if someone reaches the rest, they have united the message with faith and been tested:

The good news must be united by obedient faith (putting Jesus' words into action):

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *Hebrews 4:1-2* - Therefore, while the promise of entering his rest still stands, let us fear lest any of you should seem to have failed to reach it. For good news came to us just as to them, but the message they heard did not benefit them, because they were not united by faith with those who listened. (ESV)

  *John 6:37* - All that the Father gives me will come to me, and _whoever comes to me_ I will never cast out. (ESV)
#+END_QUOTE

I believe that anyone who is trusting in Jesus for His finished work is saved. Believing the gospel is obeying the gospel. I just think there's more to it in terms of abiding forever. Because we must bear fruit etc. and follow His commandments to come to know Him. I don't condemn anyone who is believing on Him for life through His name.

Doing the will of God is what it means to be led by the Spirit. So you have to *do* the will of God, being a servant of Christ under the law of Christ, to have the blessing of not being condemned by the law of Moses:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *Psalms 143:10* - _Teach me to do your will,_ for you are my God! *Let your good Spirit lead me* on level ground! (ESV)

Walk according to the will of God. Walk the way Jesus Christ has called us to walk:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *Galatians 5:16-18* - But I say, *walk by the Spirit*, and you will not gratify the desires of the flesh. For the desires of the flesh are against the Spirit, and the desires of the Spirit are against the flesh, for these are opposed to each other, to keep you from doing the things you want to do. But *if* you are led by the Spirit, you are not under the law.
#+END_QUOTE

Those who love Him, obey Him:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *James 1:12* - Blessed is the man who remains steadfast under *trial,* for when he has stood the test he will receive the _crown of life,_ which God has promised to those who love him. (ESV)
#+END_QUOTE

The crown of life is gifted to those who are obedient, and have been tested:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *Revelation 2:10* - Do not fear what you are about to suffer. Behold, the devil is about to throw some of you into prison, that you may be *tested,* and for ten days you will have tribulation. Be faithful unto death, and I will give you the _crown of life._ (ESV)
#+END_QUOTE

And I also think people have free will to sabotage their race.

Clearly 'believe' means also 'to be obedient' to because the ones that _follow Jesus_ (which means obey His commandments) are the ones who are counted as believing (*pisteuo*):

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *John 10:26-38* - but you do not believe (G4100 *pisteuo*) because you are not part of my flock. My sheep _hear my voice,_ and _I know them, and they follow me._ I give them eternal life, and they will never perish, and no one will snatch them out of my hand. My Father, who has given them to me, is greater than all, and no one is able to snatch them out of the Father's hand. I and the Father are one.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *Galatians 4:4-9* - But when the fullness of time had come, God sent forth his Son, born of woman, born under the law, to redeem those who were under the law, so that we might receive adoption as sons. And because you are sons, God has _sent the Spirit of his Son into our hearts, crying, Abba! Father!_ So you are no longer a slave, but a son, and if a son, then an heir through God. Formerly, when you did not know God, you were enslaved to those that by nature are not gods. But now that you have come to know God, or rather to be known by God, how can you turn back again to the weak and worthless elementary principles of the world, whose slaves you want to be once more? (ESV)
#+END_QUOTE

I guess that means we should become slaves of Christ! We should be overcome by Christ:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *Romans 6:22-23*- But now that you have been set free from sin and have become slaves of God, the fruit you get leads to sanctification and its end, eternal life. For the wages of sin is death, but the free gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord. (ESV)

Christ's Spirit is a spirit of adoption as sons, by whom we cry, "Abba! Father!" It's not a spirit of slavery. So with a spirit of adoption we are slaves to God:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *Romans 8:13-17* - For if you live according to the flesh you will die, but if by the Spirit you put to death the deeds of the body, you will live. For all who are led by the Spirit of God are sons of God. For you did not receive the spirit of slavery to fall back into fear, but you have received the Spirit of adoption as sons, by whom we cry, Abba! Father! The Spirit himself bears witness with our spirit that we are children of God, and if children, then heirs—heirs of God and fellow heirs with Christ, provided we suffer with him in order that we may also be glorified with him. (ESV)
#+END_QUOTE

We must be in Christ Jesus as a new creation:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE

From now on, therefore, we regard no one according to the flesh. Even though we once regarded Christ according to the flesh, we regard him thus no longer. Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation. The old has passed away; behold, the new has come.

  *Matthew 25:1-13* - Then the kingdom of heaven will be like ten virgins who took their lamps and went to meet the bridegroom. Five of them were foolish, and five were wise. For when the foolish took their lamps, they took no oil with them, but the wise took flasks of oil with their lamps. As the bridegroom was delayed, they all became drowsy and slept. But at midnight there was a cry, Here is the bridegroom! Come out to meet him. Then all those virgins rose and trimmed their lamps. And the foolish said to the wise, Give us some of your oil, for our lamps are going out. But the wise answered, saying, Since there will not be enough for us and for you, go rather to the dealers and buy for yourselves. And while they were going to buy, the bridegroom came, and those who were ready went in with him to the marriage feast, and the door was shut. Afterward the other virgins came also, saying, Lord, lord, open to us. But he answered, _Truly, I say to you, I do not know you._ Watch therefore, for you know neither the day nor the hour.

And he called his disciples to him and said to them, Truly, I say to you, _this poor widow has put in more than all those who are contributing to the offering box. For they all contributed out of their abundance, but she out of her poverty has put in everything she had, all she had to live on._ (ESV)
#+END_QUOTE

Good work is rewarded. Lazy, disobedient belief is punished, and the worthless servant who was entrusted with some work but was unfaithful with his work (doesn't matter how much work it is) is cast away. Jesus isn't a hard taskmaster but wants our whole heart. Jesus must be our Master:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *Matthew 25:14-30* - For it will be like a man going on a journey, who called his servants and entrusted to them his property. To one he gave five talents, to another two, to another one, to each according to his ability. Then he went away. He who had received the five talents went at once and traded with them, and he made five talents more. So also he who had the two talents made two talents more. But he who had received the one talent went and dug in the ground and hid his master's money. Now after a long time the master of those servants came and settled accounts with them. And he who had received the five talents came forward, bringing five talents more, saying, Master, you delivered to me five talents; here I have made five talents more. _His master said to him, Well done, good and faithful servant._ You have been faithful over a little; I will set you over much. Enter into the joy of your master. And he also who had the two talents came forward, saying, Master, you delivered to me two talents; here I have made two talents more. His master said to him, Well done, good and faithful servant. You have been faithful over a little; I will set you over much. Enter into the joy of your master. He also who had received the one talent came forward, saying, Master, I knew you to be a hard man, reaping where you did not sow, and gathering where you scattered no seed, so I was afraid, and I went and hid your talent in the ground. Here you have what is yours. But his master answered him, You wicked and slothful servant! You knew that I reap where I have not sowed and gather where I scattered no seed? Then you ought to have invested my money with the bankers, and at my coming I should have received what was my own with interest. So take the talent from him and give it to him who has the ten talents. For to everyone who has will more be given, and he will have an abundance. But from the one who has not, even what he has will be taken away. And cast the _worthless servant_ into the outer darkness. In that place there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.

And he will place the sheep on his right, but the goats on the left. Then the King will say to those on his right, Come, you who are blessed by my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world. For I was hungry and you gave me food, I was thirsty and you gave me drink, I was a stranger and you welcomed me, _I was naked and you clothed me, I was sick and you visited me, I was in prison and you came to me._ Then the righteous will answer him, saying, Lord, when did we see you hungry and feed you, or thirsty and give you drink? And when did we see you a stranger and welcome you, or naked and clothe you? And when did we see you sick or in prison and visit you? And the King will answer them, Truly, I say to you, _as you did it to one of the least of these my brothers, you did it to me._

Then they also will answer, saying, Lord, when did we see you hungry or thirsty or a stranger or naked or sick or in prison, and did not minister to you?

Repentance:
- Someone who has _only belief in the gift of grace and no obedience to Jesus_ (which is effectively hating Jesus) _must repent_ and come to have an obedient heart.
- Someone who has _only obedience to Jesus' precepts but unbelieving and unsubmissive_ to the righteousness of God _must repent_ and come to have a believing heart.

If people from either category do not repent, then beware because God has the ability and jurisdiction to _cast that person out - graft them out of Christ._ Also, let's not become proud, but stand in awe.

God draws the person to Jesus:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *John 6:44-46* - No one can come to me unless the Father who sent me draws him. And I will raise him up on the last day. It is written in the Prophets, And they will all be taught by God.

Coming to Jesus is the requirement for not being cast out, and coming to Jesus Christ means obedience and following Jesus:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *Luke 18:16-22* - But Jesus called them to him, saying, Let the children come to me, and do not hinder them, for to such belongs the kingdom of God. Truly, I say to you, whoever does not receive the kingdom of God like a child shall not enter it. And a ruler asked him, Good Teacher, what must I do to inherit eternal life? And Jesus said to him, Why do you call me good? No one is good except God alone. You know the commandments: Do not commit adultery, Do not murder, Do not steal, Do not bear false witness, Honor your father and mother. And he said, All these I have kept from my youth. When Jesus heard this, he said to him, One thing you still lack. Sell all that you have and distribute to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; and come, follow me.

Christ Jesus judged Paul *faithful* - Paul was faithful, and Jesus Christ is Paul's Lord.
Paul received mercy to become obedient.
Paul received mercy because he was *acting ignorantly* - behaving in a way which came from disbelief.
So then, Christ Jesus displays in Paul His perfect patience to those who would trust in Him for eternal life and be brought from ungodliness into godliness - disobedience into obedience.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *I Timothy 1:12-16* - I thank him who has given me strength, Christ Jesus our Lord, because he judged me faithful, appointing me to his service, though formerly I was a blasphemer, persecutor, and insolent opponent. But I received mercy because I had acted ignorantly in unbelief, and the grace of our Lord overflowed for me with the faith and love that are in Christ Jesus. The saying is trustworthy and deserving of full acceptance, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners, of whom I am the foremost. But I received mercy for this reason, that in me, as the foremost, Jesus Christ might display his perfect patience as an example to those who were to believe in him for eternal life. (ESV)
#+END_QUOTE

You *must* believe:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *Romans 11:20-23* - That is true. _They were broken off because of their unbelief, but you stand fast through faith._ So do not become proud, but stand in awe. For if God did not spare the natural branches, neither will he spare you. And even they, if they do not continue in their unbelief, will be grafted in, for God has the power to graft them in again.

You *must* obey:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *John 15:1-6* - I am the true vine, and my Father is the vinedresser.  Every branch of mine that does not bear fruit he takes away, and every branch that does bear fruit he prunes, that it may bear more fruit.  Already you are clean because of the word that I have spoken to you.  Abide in me, and I in you. As the branch cannot bear fruit by itself, unless it abides in the vine, neither can you, unless you abide in me.  I am the vine; you are the branches. Whoever abides in me and I in him, he it is that bears much fruit, for apart from me you can do nothing. _If anyone does not abide in me he is thrown away like a branch and withers; and the branches are gathered, thrown into the fire, and burned._
#+END_QUOTE

We *must* put a stop to sin:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *Ezekiel 18:20-21* - The soul who sins shall die. The son shall not suffer for the iniquity of the father, nor the father suffer for the iniquity of the son. The righteousness of the righteous shall be upon himself, and the wickedness of the wicked shall be upon himself. But if a wicked person turns away from all his sins that he has committed and keeps all my statutes and does what is just and right, he shall surely live; he shall not die. (ESV)

#+END_QUOTE

So I believe that Jesus saves us by giving us of His Spirit and helping us to put sin to death, through obedient faith:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *1 John 3:4-9* - Everyone who makes a practice of sinning also practices lawlessness; sin is lawlessness.  You know that *he appeared to take away sins, and in him there is no sin.  No one who abides in him keeps on sinning; no one who keeps on sinning has either seen him or known him.*  Little children, let no one deceive you.  Whoever practices righteousness is righteous, as he is righteous.  Whoever makes a practice of sinning is of the devil, for the devil has been sinning from the beginning.  The reason the Son of God appeared was to destroy the works of the devil.  No one born of God makes a practice of sinning, for God's seed abides in him, and he cannot keep on sinning because he has been born of God.  (ESV)
#+END_QUOTE

Walking in obedient faith is walking in forgiveness and love towards other people, forgiveness and love that flows out from _having been_ loved and having been forgiven.

The faith working through love towards God and other people flows out of believing in and accepting Jesus and His atoning sacrifice and from being freely forgiven by Jesus.

I think the person who has arrived at this point has repented from dead work and is now living for Jesus.

*** We must have a changed heart, which longs to serve the living God, to be a bondservant of Jesus. AMEN!!
God gives us the new heart when we seek to have that new heart.

To be saved we need to have an obedient heart to God.

_Will to do God's will_ - will to be obedient, and God will give you the heart to obey Him.

When you trust Jesus, you will to do His will.

Living as a new Creation in Christ means God has given you the heart to desire to obey Jesus' commandments. We are under Christ's law.

It means, through the power of *the Holy Spirit*, to no longer practice lying, adultery, idolatry, and covetousness, and to no longer dishonour our parents, and to now honour Jesus Christ in our lives and bodies.

It's going from disobedience to God (as Adam was disobedient) to obedience to God (as Christ is obedient):

Faith works through love; we must be like Jesus - exercising sacrificial, merciful love. The term 'new creature' is used in Galatians 6 after saying we must 'put sin to death and do good', sowing to the spirit and not to the flesh.
Sowing to the Spirit is obediently following Jesus:

If a person doesn't obey Jesus and His commandments then they probably are not saved because they either deny they have the spiritual circumcision which causes us to obey,

If anyone does not abide in me he is thrown away like a branch and withers; and the branches are gathered, thrown into the fire, and burned. If you abide in me, and my words abide in you, ask whatever you wish, and it will be done for you. By this my Father is glorified, that you bear much fruit and so prove to be my disciples.

Truly, truly, I say to you, unless a grain of wheat falls into the earth and dies, it remains alone; but if it dies, it bears much fruit. Whoever loves his life loses it, and whoever hates his life in this world will keep it for eternal life. _If anyone serves me, he must follow me; and where I am, there will my servant be also. If anyone serves me, the Father will honor him._ (ESV)

You know the commandments: Do not murder, Do not commit adultery, Do not steal, Do not bear false witness, Do not defraud, Honor your father and mother. And he said to him, Teacher, all these I have kept from my youth. And Jesus, looking at him, loved him, and said to him, You lack one thing: go, sell all that you have and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; and come, follow me.

Do nothing from rivalry or conceit, but in humility count others more significant than yourselves. Let each of you look not only to his own interests, but also to the interests of others. Have this mind among yourselves, which is yours in Christ Jesus, who, though he was in the form of God, did not count equality with God a thing to be grasped, but made himself nothing, *taking the form of a servant*, being born in the likeness of men. And being found in human form, he humbled himself by becoming obedient to the point of death, even death on a cross. Therefore God has highly exalted him and bestowed on him the name that is above every name, so that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, in heaven and on earth and under the earth, and every tongue confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father. Therefore, my beloved, as you have always obeyed, so now, not only as in my presence but much more in my absence, *work out your own salvation with fear and trembling, for it is God who works in you, both to will and to work* for his good pleasure.

Whoever trusts in Jesus Christ shouldn't perish, but they should have eternal life. We've just got to have faith in Jesus:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *John 3:16-21* - For God so loved the world, that he gave his only Son, that whoever (G3956 pas) believes (G4100 pisteuo) in him should not perish but have eternal life. For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but in order that the world might be saved through him. Whoever believes in him is not condemned, but whoever does not believe is condemned already, because he has not believed in the name of the only Son of God. And this is the judgment: the light has come into the world, and people loved the darkness rather than the light because their deeds were evil. For everyone who does wicked things hates the light and does not come to the light, lest his deeds should be exposed. But _whoever does what is true comes to the light_, so that _it may be clearly seen that his deeds have been carried out in God_. (ESV)
#+END_QUOTE

The gospel /involves/ having _believing_ *and* _obedient_ heart. The entrypoint is believing in Jesus Christ to be saved - that itself is an act of obedience.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *John 6:28-29* - Then they said to him, _What must we do, to be doing the works of God?_ Jesus answered them, This is the work of God, that *you believe (G4100 pisteuo) in him whom he has sent.* (ESV)
#+END_QUOTE

The obedience of heart:
- having of faith in Jesus and Jesus' name.

The obedience produces work:
- carrying out deeds done in God.
- coming to the light.

If belief and obedience can even be separated, I think being saved starts with belief or obedience and arrives at both belief and obedience.
Belief and obedience are both fundamental qualities of faith.

Notice how just after *John 3:16* it says, "whoever _does what is true comes to the light._"

_Whoever has faith in and puts their trust in in Jesus Christ is not condemned and should not perish._

We have *always obeyed* - God works through us:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *Philippians 2:12-13* - Therefore, my beloved, as you have *always obeyed*, so now, not only as in my presence but much more in my absence, work out (katergazomai) your own salvation with fear and trembling, for it is *God who works in you, both to will and to work* for his good pleasure. (ESV)
#+END_QUOTE

We must honour Jesus Christ:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *John 5:21-24* - For as the Father raises the dead and gives them life, so also the Son gives life to whom he will. The Father judges no one, but has given all judgment to the Son, that all may honor the Son, just as they honor the Father. _Whoever does not honor the Son does not honor the Father who sent him_. Truly, truly, I say to you, whoever _hears my word and believes (G4100 *pisteuo*) him who sent me has eternal life_. He does not come into judgment, but has passed from death to life.
#+END_QUOTE

I believe =John 5:24= is a true statement and that it should not be read outside of the words Jesus said directly before it (=Whoever does not honor the Son does not honor the Father who sent him=).

We do not nullify the rest of what Jesus has commanded of and asked of us. If Jesus is your judge, then I think it's wise to take on board the rest of what Jesus has said:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *Philippians 1:15-22* - Some indeed preach Christ from envy and rivalry, but others from good will. The latter do it out of love, knowing that I am put here for the defense of the gospel. The former proclaim Christ out of rivalry, not sincerely but thinking to afflict me in my imprisonment. What then? Only that in every way, whether in pretense or in truth, Christ is proclaimed, and in that I rejoice. Yes, and I will rejoice, for I know that through your prayers and the help of the Spirit of Jesus Christ this will turn out for my deliverance, as _it is my eager expectation and hope that I will not be at all ashamed, but that with full courage now as always Christ will be honored in my body, whether by life or by death_. For to me to live is Christ, and to die is gain. _If I am to live in the flesh, that means fruitful labor for me._ Yet which I shall choose I cannot tell.
#+END_QUOTE

We're not justified through the works of the law but through faith, and faith involves obedience to Jesus Christ:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *Galatians 2:15-16* - “We are Jews by nature and not sinners from among the Gentiles; nevertheless knowing that a man is not justified by the works of the Law but through faith in Christ Jesus, even we have believed in Christ Jesus, so that we may be *justified by faith in Christ* and not by the works of the Law; since by the works of the Law no flesh will be justified.

** The free gift of salvation is to be set free from sin to be a slave of righteousness
The free gift is to be set free from sin to be
a salve of righteousness - that is received
through faith, received by those who obey Jesus.

The faith that receives the free gift of salvation is obedient to Jesus.

So when the Spirit begins working in you, and
you obey, you are receiving the salvation.

Is this considered being saved by works or being saved by faith?

This is considered being saved by faith and not by works.

We must now consider ourselves dead to sin and alive to God in Christ Jesus.
We must now present ourselves as obedient slaves to righteousness - yes, practicing personal righteousness in accordance with Jesus Christ's commandments.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *Romans 6* - What shall we say then? Are we to continue in sin that grace may abound? By no means! How can we who died to sin still live in it? Do you not know that *all of us who have been baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into his death?* We were buried therefore with him by baptism into death, in order that, just as Christ was raised from the dead by the glory of the Father, we too might walk in newness of life. For *if we have been united with him in a death like his, we shall certainly be united with him in a resurrection like his*. We know that our old self was crucified with him in order that the body of sin might be brought to nothing, so that we would no longer be enslaved to sin. For one who has died has been set free from sin. Now if we have died with Christ, we believe that we will also live with him. We know that Christ being raised from the dead will never die again; death no longer has dominion over him. For the death he died he died to sin, once for all, but the life he lives he lives to God. So *you also must consider yourselves dead to sin and alive to God in Christ Jesus.* Let not sin therefore reign in your mortal bodies, to make you obey their passions. Do not present your members to sin as instruments for unrighteousness, but present yourselves to God as those who have been brought from death to life, and your members to God as instruments for righteousness. For sin will have no dominion over you, since you are not under law but under grace. What then? Are we to sin because we are not under law but under grace? By no means! Do you not know that if you present yourselves to anyone as obedient slaves, you are slaves of the one whom you obey, either of sin, which leads to death, or of obedience, which leads to righteousness? But thanks be to God, that you who were once slaves of sin have become obedient *from the heart* to the standard of teaching to which you were committed, and, having been set free from sin, have become slaves of righteousness. I am speaking in human terms, because of your natural limitations. For just as you once presented your members as slaves to impurity and to lawlessness leading to more lawlessness, so now present your members as slaves to righteousness leading to sanctification. When you were slaves of sin, you were free in regard to righteousness. But what fruit were you getting at that time from the things of which you are now ashamed? The end of those things is death. But now that you have been set free from sin and have become slaves of God, the fruit you get leads to sanctification and its end, eternal life. For the wages of sin is death, but *the free gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.* (ESV)

Therefore, to be in Christ Jesus our Lord, God puts us in and we then have a change of mindset, presenting ourselves as obedient slaves to Jesus Christ. Is that considered a bad thing to be a slave to righteousness? No, it's considered as being in Christ Jesus.

The Holy Spirit in us *is the gift* which is in us:

God poured out His Holy Spirit richly on us through Jesus Christ our Saviour. This would not be possible without having sent Jesus Christ to die for our sins and be raised for our justification. To be able to be justified is pure grace. To be able to have faith in Jesus is pure grace.
But we must put our faith in Jesus Christ!

** Becoming a servant, humbling oneself and following Jesus is what we should do

A religious spirit is:
- not being a servant
- neglects the weightier matters of the law: *justice* and *mercy* and *faithfulness*
- an emphasis on outward appearances over inner transformation
- hypocrisy
- uses the law as a beating tool on other people
  - they use the law superficially
- but are *lawless in reality*
  - their relationship with God is really busted up - not being faithful to God

True religion:
- focuses on purifying the heart, and obeying God's commandments in truth, accountable to God
- as far as the law is concerned
  - externally prioritises justice, mercy and faithfulness
  - inwardly tries to maintain a holy heart, and a relationship with God
- serving Jesus
- avoids judging people with the law to cut people down, but encourages people to be accountable to God with it
- bear one another's burdens

We're under the _law of Christ,_ and that shouldn't be a heavy burden:

For you neither enter yourselves nor allow those who would enter to go in._ Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites!

And you say, If anyone swears by the altar, it is nothing, but if anyone swears by the gift that is on the altar, he is bound by his oath. You blind men!

And whoever swears by the temple swears by it and by him who dwells in it. And whoever swears by heaven swears by the throne of God and by him who sits upon it. Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you tithe mint and dill and cumin, and have *neglected* the weightier matters of the law: *justice and mercy and faithfulness*. These you ought to have done, without neglecting the others. You blind guides, straining out a gnat and swallowing a camel! Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you clean the outside of the cup and the plate, but inside they are full of greed and self-indulgence. You blind Pharisee! First _clean the inside of the cup and the plate, that the outside also may be clean._ Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you are like whitewashed tombs, which outwardly appear beautiful, but within are full of dead people's bones and all uncleanness. So you also outwardly appear righteous to others, but within you are *full of hypocrisy and lawlessness*. Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you build the tombs of the prophets and decorate the monuments of the righteous, saying, If we had lived in the days of our fathers, we would not have taken part with them in shedding the blood of the prophets. Thus you witness against yourselves that you are sons of those who murdered the prophets. Fill up, then, the measure of your fathers.

So Jesus said to them, Truly, truly, I say to you, the Son can do nothing of his own accord, but only what he sees the Father doing. For whatever the Father does, that the Son does likewise. For the Father loves the Son and shows him all that he himself is doing. And greater works than these will he show him, so that you may marvel. For as the Father raises the dead and gives them life, so also the Son gives life to whom he will. The Father judges no one, but has given all judgment to the Son, that all may honor the Son, just as they honor the Father. _Whoever does not honor the Son does not honor the Father who sent him._ Truly, truly, I say to you, _whoever hears my word and believes him who sent me has eternal life. He does not come into judgment, but has passed from death to life._ Truly, truly, I say to you, an hour is coming, and is now here, when the dead will hear the voice of the Son of God, and those who hear will live. For as the Father has life in himself, so he has granted the Son also to have life in himself. And he has given him authority to execute judgment, because he is the Son of Man.

He will come and destroy those tenants and give the vineyard to others. When they heard this, they said, Surely not! But he looked directly at them and said, What then is this that is written: The stone that the builders rejected has become the cornerstone? Everyone who falls on that stone will be broken to pieces, and when it falls on anyone, it will crush him.

  We believe in one God,
        the Father almighty,
        maker of heaven and earth,
        of all things visible and invisible.

  And in one Lord Jesus Christ,
        the only-begotten Son of God,
        begotten from the Father before all ages,
             God from God,
             Light from Light,
             true God from true God,
        begotten, not made;
        of the same essence as the Father.
        Through him all things were made.
        For us and for our salvation
             he came down from heaven;
             he became incarnate by the Holy Spirit and the virgin Mary,
             and was made human.
             He was crucified for us under Pontius Pilate;
             he suffered and was buried.
             The third day he rose again, according to the Scriptures.
             He ascended to heaven
             and is seated at the right hand of the Father.
             He will come again with glory
             to judge the living and the dead.
             His kingdom will never end.

  And we believe in the Holy Spirit,
        the Lord, the giver of life.
        He proceeds from the Father and the Son,
        and with the Father and the Son is worshiped and glorified.
        He spoke through the prophets.
        We believe in one holy catholic and apostolic church.
        We affirm one baptism for the forgiveness of sins.
        We look forward to the resurrection of the dead,
        and to life in the world to come. Amen.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  Thus, the Son is not one-third of the being of God; he is all of the being of God. The Father is not one-third of the being of God; he is all of the being of God. And likewise with the Holy Spirit. Thus, as Wayne Grudem writes, “When we speak of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit together we are not speaking of any greater being than when we speak of the Father alone, the Son alone, or the Holy Spirit alone” (Ibid., 252).
  
  There is only one God. If each Person of the Trinity is distinct and yet fully God, then should we conclude that there is more than one God? Obviously we cannot, for Scripture is clear that there is only one God: “There is no other God besides me, a righteous God and a Savior; there is none besides me. Turn to me and be saved, all the ends of the earth! For I am God, and there is no other”.

Whoever honours Jesus by obeying Him, honours Father God. Whoever hears these words from Jesus and trusts Father God has eternal life and doesn't come into judgement; When we start trusting (believing and obeying) Jesus, we have passed from death into life.

  *John 5:17-29* - But Jesus answered them, My Father is working until now, and I am working. This was why the Jews were seeking all the more to kill him, because not only was he breaking the Sabbath, but he was even calling God his own Father, making himself equal with God. So Jesus said to them, Truly, truly, I say to you, the Son can do nothing of his own accord, but only what he sees the Father doing. For whatever the Father does, that the Son does likewise. For the Father loves the Son and shows him all that he himself is doing. And greater works than these will he show him, so that you may marvel. For as the Father raises the dead and gives them life, so also the Son gives life to whom he will. The Father judges no one, but has given all judgment to the Son, that all may honor the Son, just as they honor the Father. _Whoever does not honor the Son does not honor the Father who sent him._ Truly, truly, I say to you, _whoever hears my word and believes him who sent me has eternal life. He does not come into judgment, but has passed from death to life._ Truly, truly, I say to you, an hour is coming, and is now here, when the dead will hear the voice of the Son of God, and those who hear will live. For as the Father has life in himself, so he has granted the Son also to have life in himself. And he has given him authority to execute judgment, because he is the Son of Man. Do not marvel at this, for an hour is coming when all who are in the tombs will hear his voice and come out, _those who have done good to the resurrection of life, and those who have done evil to the resurrection of judgment._ (ESV)

*** Having faith (living in accordance with the truth, and in relationship with God) is asked of us - faith continues
What I mean by relationship is:
- being obedient to God,
  - abiding in Jesus

- being led by the Spirit of God,

Do nothing from rivalry or conceit, but in humility count others more significant than yourselves. Let each of you look not only to his own interests, but also to the interests of others. Have this mind among yourselves, which is yours in Christ Jesus, who, though he was in the form of God, did not count equality with God a thing to be grasped, but made himself nothing, *taking the form of a servant*, being born in the likeness of men. And being found in human form, he humbled himself by becoming obedient to the point of death, even death on a cross. Therefore God has highly exalted him and bestowed on him the name that is above every name, so that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, in heaven and on earth and under the earth, and every tongue confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father. Therefore, my beloved, as you have always obeyed, so now, not only as in my presence but much more in my absence, *work out your own salvation with fear and trembling, for it is God who works in you, both to will and to work* for his good pleasure.

But whatever gain I had, I counted as loss for the sake of Christ. (ESV)

  *II Corinthians 8:3-12* - For they gave according to their means, as I can testify, and beyond their means, *of their own free will*, begging us earnestly for the favor of taking part in the relief of the saints— and this, not as we expected, but *they gave themselves first to the Lord and then by the will of God to us*. Accordingly, we urged Titus that as he had started, so he should complete among you this act of grace. But as you excel in everything—in faith, in speech, in knowledge, in all earnestness, and in our love for you—see that you excel in this act of grace also. I say this not as a command, but to prove by the earnestness of others that your love also is genuine. For you know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that though he was rich, yet for your sake he became poor, so that you by his poverty might become rich. And in this matter I give my judgment: this benefits you, who a year ago started not only to do this work but also to desire to do it. So now finish doing it as well, so that your readiness in desiring it may be matched by your completing it out of what you have. For if the readiness is there, it is acceptable according to what a person has, not according to what he does not have. (ESV)

Therefore _let anyone who thinks that he stands take heed lest he fall._ No temptation has overtaken you that is not common to man.

But now you *must* put them all away: anger, wrath, malice, slander, and obscene talk from your mouth.

Let us hold fast the confession of our hope without wavering, for he who promised is faithful. And let us consider how to stir up one another to love and good works, not neglecting to meet together, as is the habit of some, but encouraging one another, and all the more as you see the Day drawing near.

Jesus has been perfectly obedient, so Jesus speaks what Father God speaks, and when someone seeks Jesus Christ, they see Father God, because Father God has been revealed to us in Jesus Christ. The Father is in the Son. The Word is God.

Also, through perfect obedience, Jesus has spoken Father God's commandment of eternal life, which is what He has said:
- "_the Father who sent me has himself given me a commandment—what to say and what to speak._"

Whoever has faith in Jesus, has faith in God. Whoever sees Jesus sees the Father:

**** Baptism is an appeal to God for a good conscience through the [death and] resurrection of Jesus Christ's, taking part in it
I think baptism of water is an *appeal* to God and identifying oneself into Christ's death and resurrection but the sacrament *maybe* is not strictly required to be saved (as far as I understand).

To be baptised is an act of obedience.

I definitely believe that "believer's baptism" is the right way to perform baptism.
Baptism does save.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *Psalms 34:11-22* - Come, O children, listen to me; I will teach you the _fear of the Lord_. What man is there who desires life and loves many days, that he may see good? Keep your tongue from evil and your lips from speaking deceit. Turn away from evil and do good; seek peace and pursue it. _The eyes of the Lord are toward the righteous and his ears toward their cry_. The face of the Lord is against those who do evil, to cut off the memory of them from the earth. When the righteous cry for help, the Lord hears and delivers them out of all their troubles. The Lord is near to the brokenhearted and saves the crushed in spirit. Many are the afflictions of the righteous, but the Lord delivers him out of them all. He keeps all his bones; not one of them is broken. Affliction will slay the wicked, and those who hate the righteous will be condemned. The Lord redeems the life of his servants; none of those who take refuge in him will be condemned.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *Galatians 1:15-20*- But when he who had set me apart before I was born, and who called me by his grace, was pleased to reveal his Son to me, in order that I might preach him among the Gentiles, I did not immediately consult with anyone; nor did I go up to Jerusalem to those who were apostles before me, but I went away into Arabia, and returned again to Damascus. Then after three years I went up to Jerusalem to visit Cephas and remained with him fifteen days. But I saw none of the other apostles except James the Lord's brother. (In what I am writing to you, before God, I do not lie! )
#+END_QUOTE

Interestingly, James believes that a person is justified not by faith alone, but by works of faith:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *James 2:21-24* - Was not Abraham our father justified by works when he offered up Isaac his son on the altar? You see that faith was working with his works, and as a result of the works, faith was perfected; and the Scripture was fulfilled which says, “And Abraham believed God, and it was reckoned to him as righteousness,” and he was called the friend of God. You see that a man is justified by works and not by faith alone.

Circumcision of the flesh does not matter:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE

Was it before or after he had been circumcised? It was not after, but before he was circumcised. He received the sign of circumcision as a seal of the righteousness that he had by faith while he was still uncircumcised. The purpose was to make him the father of all who believe (G4100 pisteuo) without being circumcised, so that righteousness would be counted to them as well, and to make him the father of the circumcised who are not merely circumcised but who also walk in the footsteps of the faith that our father Abraham had before he was circumcised.
#+END_QUOTE

We must share the faith of Abraham to receive the grace:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *Romans 4:13-17* - For the promise to Abraham and his offspring that he would be heir of the world did not come through the law but through the righteousness of faith. For if it is the adherents of the law who are to be the heirs, faith is null and the promise is void. For the law brings wrath, but where there is no law there is no transgression. That is why it depends on faith, in order that the promise may rest on grace and be guaranteed to all his offspring—not only to the adherent of the law but also to the one who shares the faith of Abraham, who is the father of us all, as it is written, I have made you the father of many nations—in the presence of the God in whom he believed, who gives life to the dead and calls into existence the things that do not exist.
#+END_QUOTE

In hope, Abraham believed against hope. He didn't weaken in faith, even when it seemed impossible.
He trusted and believed God, and grew strong in his faith and gave glory to God. _We should do the same._

We must believe on Him (God) who raised Jesus from the dead, with the faith that Abraham had - Abraham's faith was working, but it wasn't the works that justified Him, it was the faith.

If a person lives their life as a living sacrifice to honour and serve Jesus Christ, which is honouring and having faith in God, then all of that is analogous to Abraham's works of faith.

We must trust God in hope against hope, and not weaken in faith, and trust God's promise, and honour Jesus Christ with our lives - that is what I believe.

The most important thing is this faith - but God certainly uses our works of faith:

Our salvation comes from faith alone in God for the promise of forgiveness from sin and hope of eternal life with Christ Jesus for those who believe in God who raised Jesus Christ from the dead, our Lord, who was delivered up for our trespasses and raised for our justification.

It's because of what Jesus Christ has done that we are justified, not because of anything we have done. We must trust in God to justify us we hold to our faith.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *Romans 4:18-25* - _In hope he believed (G4100 pisteuo) against hope_, that he should become the father of many nations, as he had been told, So shall your offspring be. He did not weaken in faith when he considered his own body, which was as good as dead (since he was about a hundred years old), or when he considered the barrenness of Sarah's womb. No distrust made him waver concerning the promise of God, but he grew strong in his faith as he gave glory to God, fully convinced that God was able to do what he had promised. That is why his faith was counted to him as righteousness. But the words it was counted to him were not written for his sake alone, but for ours also. _It will be counted to us who believe (G4100 pisteuo) in him who raised from the dead Jesus our Lord, who was delivered up for our trespasses and raised for our justification._
#+END_QUOTE

Therefore, do not put your hope on how little faith you can have for Jesus Christ to scrape through (because Jesus Christ is the judge), but instead live for Him sincerely, doing as He has instructed us.

To follow and obey Jesus Christ with the same type of faith that Abraham had - that is what we should be doing - that's saving faith, I think. Our justification is based on what Jesus Christ has done.

Now as we live by faith, we are justified by this faith and have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ who we are _believing, following, obeying and honouring._

And we only have access to the grace if we have faith:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *Romans 5:1-2* - Therefore, since we have been justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ. Through him we have also obtained access by faith into this grace in which we stand, and we rejoice in hope of the glory of God.

And then the lawless one will be revealed, whom the Lord Jesus will kill with the breath of his mouth and bring to nothing by the appearance of his coming. The coming of the lawless one is by the activity of Satan with all power and false signs and wonders, and with all wicked deception for those who are perishing, because they refused to love the truth and so be saved. Therefore God sends them a strong delusion, so that they may believe what is false, in order that all may be condemned who did not believe the truth but had pleasure in unrighteousness. But we ought always to give thanks to God for you, brothers beloved by the Lord, because God chose you as the firstfruits to be saved, through sanctification by the Spirit and belief in the truth.

* Try to clarify what /*sin*/ looks like from Bible verses
- 1. Rejecting Jesus
  - *John 15:22-23* - If I had not come and spoken to them, they would not have been guilty of sin, but *now they have no excuse for their sin. Whoever hates me hates my Father also.*
- 2. Disobeying God - absolutely 100%
  - *Romans 5:19* - For as *by the one man's disobedience the many were made sinners*, so by the one man's obedience the many will be made righteous.
  - Breaking God's law? Sure.
    - Breaking the Mosaic Law is sin for Jews and disobedient people.
- 3. An evil heart or mind which is hostile to God
- 4. Evil deeds. Absolutely How is that defined though?
  - I would say it's *breaking the Great Commandments*
  - To not love God with all one's heart, mind, soul and strength, and to not love their neighbour.

For I think that God has exhibited us apostles as last of all, like men sentenced to death, because we have become a spectacle to the world, to angels, and to men. We are fools for Christ's sake, but you are wise in Christ. We are weak, but you are strong. You are held in honor, but we in disrepute. To the present hour we hunger and thirst, we are poorly dressed and buffeted and homeless, and we labor, working with our own hands. When reviled, we bless; when persecuted, we endure; when slandered, we entreat. We have become, and are still, like the scum of the world, the refuse of all things. I do not write these things to make you ashamed, but to admonish you as my beloved children. For though you have countless guides in Christ, you do not have many fathers. For I became your father in Christ Jesus through the gospel. I urge you, then, be imitators of me. (ESV)

It is because you cannot bear to hear my word. You are of your father the devil, and your will is to do your father's desires. He was a murderer from the beginning, and has nothing to do with the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he lies, he speaks out of his own character, for he is a liar and the father of lies.

We have to have faith which is characteristic of Abraham's faith, but with regards to following the Lord Jesus.

Our justification comes from having trusting faith in God our Father, who has raised from the dead Jesus Christ
our *Lord* (our brother who we obey); the Jesus Christ who
was delivered up for our trespasses and raised
from the dead for our justification.

Obeying God is obeying Jesus. Having faith in God is having faith in Jesus.

He was raised *for* our justification; now in order to be justified by faith, we simply need to put our faith in Him and follow Him.

We have to die to our old self and live for Christ, simply abiding in Him.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *II Corinthians 5:14-15* - For the love of Christ controls us, because we have concluded this: that one has died for all, therefore all have died; and he died for all, that _those who live might no longer live for themselves but for him who for their sake died and was raised._

He received the sign of circumcision as a seal of the righteousness that he had by faith while he was still uncircumcised. The purpose was to make him the father of all who believe without being circumcised, so that righteousness would be counted to them as well, and to make him the father of the circumcised who are _not merely circumcised but who also walk in the footsteps of the faith that our father Abraham had before he was circumcised_.

The free gift of justification is *received through faith*.

And I believe we need an obedient heart towards Jesus to receive.

It's not about obedience to the law but about obeying Jesus / loving Jesus / trusting Jesus.

The justifying work is finished - Jesus finished it, now we follow Him through the same way he went, by obeying Him.

Now we need faith to receive it and I believe
that faith necessitates love for Jesus, which
includes obedience to Jesus, and it's the
heart that matters most, because all the work
may be burned up but we are still saved,
because it's not the work that saves, it's
faith, but I believe that faith necessitates
love/obedience to Jesus, as one of His sheep.

*** Didache
The Didache's estimated range of dating is 50-120 A.D, according to [[https://www.earlychristianwritings.com/text/didache-roberts.html][earlychristianwritings.com]].

What I like about the Didache is that it upholds righteous living and following God's Great commandments and precepts.

[[https://www.earlychristianwritings.com/text/didache-roberts.html][Didache: The Lord's Teaching Through the Twelve Apostles to the Nations]]

I think it's important to live righteously out of love for God and one's neighbour, and out of faith.

That being said, I think God does justify through faith, and I believe faith works. And working may indeed be called faith if the work is done in faith.
I also think God likely saves through works because it may be their way of demonstrating faith to Jesus.

#+END_QUOTE

Those who are in the faith _can't do anything against the truth_.

I think the Apostle here understands that we must test ourselves to see if we are in the faith, and encourage others to test themselves.
But interestingly, he says, "not that we may appear to have met the test", and "though we may seem to have failed", as if it may *appear* and *seem* as
though others have failed, but that we should *test ourselves*.

Though there may seem to be *apparent* paradoxes, and *apparent* contradictions in the Scripture, I think they either resolve or we rest in God, not relying on our own understanding. But I confidently affirm God is True, though I don't understand everything, and I affirm that my spiritual eyesight is getting cleaned up by the Spirit, through faith, and by the washing of the word, and I have confidence that Jesus Christ is in me:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *II Corinthians 13:5-8* - Examine yourselves, to see whether you are in the faith. Test yourselves. Or do you not realize this about yourselves, that Jesus Christ is in you? —unless indeed you fail to meet the test! I hope you will find out that we have not failed the test. But we pray to God that you may not do wrong—not that we may appear to have met the test, but that you may do what is right, though we may seem to have failed. For we cannot do anything against the truth, but only for the truth.

O death, where is your sting? The sting of death is sin, and the power of sin is the law. But thanks be to God, who gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.

No one born of God makes a practice of sinning, for God's seed abides in him, and he cannot keep on sinning because he has been born of God.  (ESV)

  *Galatians 3:15-18* - To give a human example, brothers: even with a man-made covenant, no one annuls it or adds to it once it has been ratified. Now the promises were made to Abraham and to his offspring. It does not say, And to offsprings, referring to many, but referring to one, And to your offspring, who is Christ. This is what I mean: the law, which came 430 years afterward, does not annul a covenant previously ratified by God, so as to make the promise void. For if the inheritance comes by the law, it no longer comes by promise; but God gave it to Abraham by a promise.

Do you not know that if you present yourselves to anyone as obedient slaves, you are slaves of the one whom you obey, either of sin, which leads to death, or of *obedience, which leads to righteousness*?  But thanks be to God, that you who were once slaves of sin have become *obedient *from the heart* to the standard of teaching to which you were committed*, and, having been set free from sin, have become *slaves of righteousness*.  I am speaking in human terms, because of your natural limitations. For just as you once presented your members as slaves to impurity and to lawlessness leading to more lawlessness, so now present your members as slaves to righteousness leading to sanctification.  When you were slaves of sin, you were free in regard to righteousness.  But what fruit were you getting at that time from the things of which you are now ashamed? The end of those things is death.  But now that you have been _set free from sin and have become slaves of God, the fruit you get leads to sanctification and its end, eternal life.

*** What must be believe, and what we must do: Walk in *truth* and *love* the way Jesus has commanded us

We must receive Jesus' words through faith, walk in them through faith and come to *know in truth* (we must truly know) that Jesus came from God, and continue in faith, continuing to be sanctified.

We must practice the truth.

Therefore, we should receive Jesus' words and _obey_ Jesus and _arrive_ at the truth. Obedience is an essential part of faith.

His divine power has granted to us all things that pertain to life and godliness, through the knowledge of him who called us to his own glory and excellence, by which he has granted to us his precious and very great promises, so that through them you may become partakers of the divine nature, having escaped from the corruption that is in the world because of sinful desire.  For this very reason, make every effort to *supplement your faith with virtue, and virtue with knowledge, and knowledge* with self-control, and self-control with steadfastness, and steadfastness with godliness, and godliness with brotherly affection, and brotherly affection with love.  For if these qualities are yours and are increasing, they keep you from being ineffective or unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ.

#+END_QUOTE

I believe that after being [[https://web.archive.org/web/20220402091720/https://mullikine.github.io/posts/astral-projection/][born-again of the spirit]], I had (with very little knowledge of Jesus' commandments) had to learn Jesus' commandments and apply them, and I believe *the Holy Spirit* taught me to obey Jesus as I read Jesus' sayings and was subsequently tested on those sayings. For example, if I read that we must give to all who ask, and then the Lord sets up a situation where someone asks for money, then I have a choice to obey Jesus, which means resisting those who try to deter me from obeying Jesus. Upon being tested, someone would offer worldly wisdom in an attempt to deter me from following Jesus, and as I obey God I am led by *the Holy Spirit*, and taught by *the Holy Spirit*. And this is an ongoing process. I say this for others' sake to explain how I have come to know how faith in Jesus, following Jesus, works practically, that it is more than mere intellectual belief to be led by the Spirit, but it is also obedience, and a process of sanctification, and walking in the light.

I rejoiced greatly to find some of your children *walking in the truth*, just as we were *commanded by the Father*.  And now I ask you, dear lady—not as though I were writing you a new commandment, but the one we have had from the beginning—that we *love one another*.  And *this is love*, _that we walk according to his commandments_; this is the commandment, just as you have heard from the beginning, so that you should walk in it.  For many deceivers have gone out into the world, those who do not confess the coming of Jesus Christ in the flesh. Such a one is the deceiver and the antichrist.  _Watch yourselves, so that you may not lose what we have worked for, but may win a full reward_.  Everyone who goes on ahead and does not abide in the teaching of Christ, does not have God. Whoever abides in the teaching has both the Father and the Son.

  *John 14:12* - Truly, truly, I say to you, whoever believes in me will also do the works that I do; and greater works than these will he do, because I am going to the Father. (ESV)
#+END_QUOTE

But works by us done in righteousness are *not* the reason God showed mercy on us to save us. God in His mercy simply gave us His Holy Spirit in abundance to wash us, to regenerate us and to renew us, and He did this so that being justified by His grace, we might become heirs according to the hope of eternal life. We were once really disobedient, but by God's grace through faith in Jesus we are now obedient. The faith was *becoming obedient* to Jesus, and out of it flows good works and obedience:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *Titus 3:3-8* - For we ourselves were *once foolish, disobedient, led astray, slaves to various passions and pleasures,* passing our days in malice and envy, hated by others and hating one another. But when the goodness and loving kindness of God our Savior appeared, he saved us, not because of works done by us in righteousness, but according to his own mercy, by the washing of regeneration and renewal of *the Holy Spirit*, whom he poured out on us richly through *Jesus Christ our Savior*, so that being justified by his grace we might become heirs according to the hope of eternal life. The saying is trustworthy, and I want you to insist on these things, so that those who have believed in God may be careful to devote themselves to good works. These things are excellent and profitable for people. (ESV)
#+END_QUOTE

So Jesus saves us to become set free from various passions and pleasures and to become far more obedient to righteousness, and this is done through faith in Jesus Christ. Believing in Jesus Christ is the entry point for the salvation that is through Him.

So the point I'm trying to make is that the free gift of *the Holy Spirit* is received by faith alone, just be trusting in Jesus Christ to be saved, but Jesus Christ helps us to become slaves of righteousness which leads to eternal life.

Therefore I still think there's a false dichotomy between faith and works - because obedience is intrinsic to faith, but the gift of *the Holy Spirit* remains a completely free gift which is _received through faith_ and that *merit* by works of righteousness is not the reason *why* it's given to us, but nevertheless, _*the Holy Spirit* is given to those who obey Him._

*echo* means 'to hold' - so in *Mark 11:22* Jesus says 'hold faith' in God.
And in *John 14:1* Jesus tells us to 'do faith' in God and to 'do faith' in Him.

If you are believing in Jesus, then you are obediently working.

To be justified, a person must _walk in the footsteps of the faith that our father Abraham had before he was circumcised_.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *Romans 4:9-12* - Is this blessing then only for the circumcised, or also for the uncircumcised? We say that faith was counted to Abraham as righteousness. How then was it counted to him? Was it before or after he had been circumcised? It was not after, but before he was circumcised. He received the sign of circumcision as a seal of the righteousness that he had by faith while he was still uncircumcised. The purpose was to make him the father of all who believe without being circumcised, so that righteousness would be counted to them as well, and to make him the father of the circumcised who are _not merely circumcised but who also walk in the footsteps of the faith that our father Abraham had before he was circumcised_.
#+END_QUOTE

Having faith in God *is* obeying God. Loving God *is* obeying God. AMEN!!

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *Luke 9:23-24* - And he said to all, If anyone would come after me, let him deny himself and take up his cross daily and follow me. For whoever would save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for my sake will save it. (ESV)

I believe that what /Romans 4:4/ is saying is that before accepting God's forgiveness yourself, submitting to the righteousness of God, believing that you were in need of God's forgiveness,
anything you try to give God is simply giving God what is due to Him, and that you will never be able to return enough stolen goods to God to ever be justified. Nor would you ever be able to forgive enough other people to attain that justification.
_You ultimately need God's forgiveness_. However, forgiving others is still required if someone wants God to forgive them.

** Obedient action including seeking God in faith (trusting God's words and seeking)

** Obedience belongs in faith
In God's mercy He has shown us the Way to be reconciled with Him. He has given us Jesus. He has told us what to do, and we can choose to be obedient or to not be obedient.

Jesus is the author of our faith, so having faith is grace from God, and even if works are working with our faith, it's all by grace and we still can't boast before God because our faith and our works are all gifted to us from God.

For example, Noah's works of building the ark was given to Him by God. God even outlined every detail.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *Hebrews 12:1-2* - Therefore, since we are surrounded by so great a cloud of witnesses, let us also lay aside every weight, and sin which clings so closely, and let us run with endurance the race that is set before us, looking to Jesus, the *founder* and *perfecter* of our faith, who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross, despising the shame, and is seated at the right hand of the throne of God.
#+END_QUOTE

- Obedience belongs inside faith because
  - God commanded it and complying is not really bringing anything
    to God which He hasn't told you to bring to Him.
    - So it's just acting in faith
    - If God commands you to build an ark, and you build it exactly as specified, is that considered dead works? No, it's just doing exactly what God said. It's faith.
    - If God commands you to wait 5 days before going into battle but you think 8 days would be better, thinking God needs the extra time so you can be more prepared so you wait 8 days then that is no longer faith because it's disobedience.
    - Abraham was commanded to offer Isaac as a sacrifice, and Abraham did offer Isaac out of faithful obedience.
      - *Genesis 22:2* - He said, Take your son, your only son Isaac, whom you love, and go to the land of Moriah, and offer him there as a burnt offering on one of the mountains of which I shall tell you.
      - *James 2:22* - You see that faith was active along with his works, and faith was completed by his works;
    - But if Abraham thought he could get even more rewards from God by trying the same thing again and putting Isaac on the altar again without God even commanding it, then that is like trying to justify yourself by doing dead works (i.e. deeds without faith).

  - Choosing to obey God's commandments even when no-one is watching (aside from God) is having faith in God.
    - For example, not stealing from your employer.
    - Therefore, there is a way of abiding by God's commandments which is faith and not works.
    - To not steal is to love God and have faith in God.
- Seeking God in action belongs in faith because:
  - When someone wills to do God's will, they come to know the truth
    - *John 7:17* - If anyone's will is to do God's will, he will know whether the teaching is from God or whether I am speaking on my own authority. (ESV)
  - When someone has faith, they believe that God exists and that in seeking God, God rewards them:
    - *Hebrews 11:6* - And without faith it is impossible to please him, for whoever would draw near to God must believe that he exists and that he rewards those who seek him.

Salvation is the gift, and faith implies an obedient heart. Works can be dead works when they're not done in faith. Faith is what justifies. But faith works. Faith requires obedience to God. Faithless works do not justify:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *Ephesians 2:8-9* - For *by grace you have been saved through faith.* And this is not your own doing; it is the gift of God, not a result of works, so that no one may boast. (ESV)

** Dead works: The type of work that's bad
What is wrong is trying to establish a righteousness of one's own apart from submitting to the righteousness of God - it's saying, "God, I think you should have this, or, God I think I'm righteous because I did this for you." rather than, "here is what you asked of me, LORD."

Work not done in faith:

But Peter said, Ananias, why has Satan filled your heart to lie to *the Holy Spirit* and to keep back for yourself part of the proceeds of the land?  While it remained unsold, did it not remain your own?  And after it was sold, was it not at your disposal?  Why is it that you have contrived this deed in your heart?

Or have you not read in the Law how on the Sabbath the priests in the temple profane the Sabbath and are guiltless? I tell you, something greater than the temple is here. And *if you had known what this means, I desire mercy, and not sacrifice, you would not have condemned the guiltless.* For the Son of Man is lord of the Sabbath.

To be justified, a person must _walk in the footsteps of the faith that our father Abraham had before he was circumcised_.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *Romans 4:9-12* - Is this blessing then only for the circumcised, or also for the uncircumcised? We say that faith was counted to Abraham as righteousness. How then was it counted to him? Was it before or after he had been circumcised? It was not after, but before he was circumcised. He received the sign of circumcision as a seal of the righteousness that he had by faith while he was still uncircumcised. The purpose was to make him the father of all who believe without being circumcised, so that righteousness would be counted to them as well, and to make him the father of the circumcised who are _not merely circumcised but who also walk in the footsteps of the faith that our father Abraham had before he was circumcised_.

*** Lordship salvation and free grace - an apparent paradox
You can't have only half of Jesus:
- I believe that free grace without belief and obedience is a lie.
- I believe a heart must be both believing *and* obedient to receive the grace through faith, since I believe true faith is both obedient and believing.

After receiving justification (counted not guilty) through obedient and believing faith, we should continue in obedient and believing faith but the work we do is to be tested and is not essential to our justification:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *1 Corinthians 3:15* - If anyone's work is burned up, he will suffer loss, though he himself will be saved, but only as through fire. (ESV)
#+END_QUOTE

We love (obey) because He loved us first, and through obedience we are sanctified, which leads to eternal life.

Heresies:
- _free grace without Lordship_ (without sanctification by the Spirit)
  - the person in this category abides in Jesus extremely precariously, and only if they are actively trusting in Jesus.
  - Trusting and obeying Jesus qualifies, but belief without obedience or trust in the heart doesn't qualify.
- _Lordship without free grace_ (working to be forgiven, without belief in the truth)
  - Well, I mean, they are actually trusting in Jesus if they are following Jesus and doing what He said.
  - But if they are just doing good works to get to heaven then I think that's not really right.

I believe that either of these heresies fall under this strong delusion category:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *2 Thessalonians 2:11-13* - Therefore God sends them a strong delusion, so that they may believe what is false, in order that all may be condemned who did not believe the truth but had pleasure in unrighteousness.

  *I Timothy 6:3-11* - If anyone teaches a different doctrine and does not agree with _the sound words of our Lord Jesus Christ and the teaching that accords with godliness_, he is _puffed up with conceit and understands nothing._ He has an unhealthy craving for controversy and for quarrels about words, which produce envy, dissension, slander, evil suspicions, and constant friction among people who are depraved in mind and deprived of the truth, imagining that godliness is a means of gain. Now there is great gain in _godliness with contentment,_ for we brought nothing into the world, and we cannot take anything out of the world. But if we have food and clothing, with these we will be content. But _those who desire to be rich fall into temptation, into a snare, into many senseless and harmful desires that plunge people into ruin and destruction._ For the love of money is a root of all kinds of evils. It is through this craving that some have wandered away from the faith and pierced themselves with many pangs. But as for you, O man of God, _flee these things_. Pursue righteousness, godliness, faith, love, steadfastness, gentleness. (ESV)

  *Exodus 14:21-30* - Then Moses stretched out his hand over the sea, and the Lord drove the sea back by a strong east wind all night and made the sea dry land, and the waters were divided. And the people of Israel went into the midst of the sea on dry ground, the waters being a wall to them on their right hand and on their left. The Egyptians pursued and went in after them into the midst of the sea, all Pharaoh's horses, his chariots, and his horsemen. And in the morning watch the Lord in the pillar of fire and of cloud looked down on the Egyptian forces and threw the Egyptian forces into a panic, clogging their chariot wheels so that they drove heavily. And the Egyptians said, Let us flee from before Israel, for the Lord fights for them against the Egyptians. Then the Lord said to Moses, Stretch out your hand over the sea, that the water may come back upon the Egyptians, upon their chariots, and upon their horsemen. So Moses stretched out his hand over the sea, and the sea returned to its normal course when the morning appeared. And as the Egyptians fled into it, the Lord threw the Egyptians into the midst of the sea. The waters returned and covered the chariots and the horsemen; of all the host of Pharaoh that had followed them into the sea, not one of them remained. But the people of Israel walked on dry ground through the sea, the waters being a wall to them on their right hand and on their left. Thus the Lord saved Israel that day from the hand of the Egyptians, and Israel saw the Egyptians dead on the seashore.

Salvation is the gift, and faith implies an obedient heart. Works can be dead works when they're not done in faith. Faith is what justifies. But faith works. Faith requires obedience to God. Faithless works do not justify:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE

**** The obedience of faith

A person must be at least willing to do His will - obedience is the essence of faith:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *John 7:17* - If anyone is willing to do His will, he will know of the teaching, whether it is of God or whether I speak from Myself.
#+END_QUOTE

I think *Ephesians 2:8-9* when it says 'through faith' doesn't actually exclude obedience (obeying Jesus), because I think obedience is intrinsic to faith.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE

When it says "not a result of works", I believe that something more like, even if works were tied into the faith, it's by grace. If a person's saving faith included works then that is fine.

#+END_QUOTE

Faith-in-God is hearing God's word and believing it, and even acting on it, or at least the readiness to act on it.
A person may act on faith in their heart by arriving at conviction. But it has to be faith in the truth.
Then, like Peter stepping out on the water, or like the woman at the well going in to town to tell people about Jesus, or turning from sinful things, it produces more obedience.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *Matthew 14:27-32* - But immediately Jesus spoke to them, saying, Take heart; it is I. Do not be afraid. And Peter answered him, Lord, if it is you, *command* me to come to you on the water. He said, Come. So Peter *got out of the boat and walked on the water and came to Jesus*. But when he saw the wind, he was afraid, and beginning to sink he cried out, Lord, save me. Jesus immediately reached out his hand and took hold of him, saying to him, O you of little faith, why did you doubt? And when they got into the boat, the wind ceased.
#+END_QUOTE

And there is an amount of faith, and true belief is all that's required to be saved, but Faith is so tightly linked to Obedience like Faith is linked to Hope. True belief is enough because it accepts what Jesus says, as a child believes. But I don't think this discounts that the same faith continues and increases through obedience.

Some people never seem to arrive:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *II Timothy 3:6-9* - For among them are those who creep into households and capture weak women, burdened with sins and led astray by various passions, always learning and _never able to arrive at a knowledge of the truth_. Just as Jannes and Jambres opposed Moses, so these _men also oppose the truth, men corrupted in mind and disqualified regarding the faith_. But they will not get very far, for their folly will be plain to all, as was that of those two men.
#+END_QUOTE

But the ones who do arrive actually _follow the teaching_:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *II Timothy 3:10-13* - You, however, have _followed my teaching, my conduct, my aim in life, my faith, my patience, my love, my steadfastness, my persecutions and sufferings that happened to me_ at Antioch, at Iconium, and at Lystra—which persecutions I endured; yet from them all the Lord rescued me. Indeed, _all who desire to live a godly life in Christ Jesus will be persecuted,_ while evil people and impostors will go on from bad to worse, deceiving and being deceived.
#+END_QUOTE

Peter demonstrated obedience. A changed heart is essential to be saved, I think, because it must produce more obedience.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *II Corinthians 10:5-6* - We destroy arguments and every lofty opinion raised against the knowledge of God, and take every thought captive to obey Christ, being ready to punish every disobedience, when your obedience is complete.

  Obedience = Submitting to the Righteousness of God * Turning from sin, loving, showing mercy, etc.

Faith has 'substance/magnitude' and may be described as a vector:
- The origin of hope/belief is represented by the point.
  - On the Faith plane, positive magnitude comes from trust in God
- Hope-from/in-God is the direction.
- Work/Love/Obedience is the magnitude.

I want to be clear, having faith in Jesus Christ is not dead faith.
Dead faith is precisely not having faith in Jesus Christ.

An obedient heart is required for it to not be 'dead faith'.

Do you not know that if you present yourselves to anyone as obedient slaves, you are slaves of the one whom you obey, either of sin, which leads to death, or of *obedience, which leads to righteousness*?  But thanks be to God, that you who were once slaves of sin have become *obedient *from the heart* to the standard of teaching to which you were committed*, and, having been set free from sin, have become *slaves of righteousness*.  I am speaking in human terms, because of your natural limitations. For just as you once presented your members as slaves to impurity and to lawlessness leading to more lawlessness, so now present your members as slaves to righteousness leading to sanctification.  When you were slaves of sin, you were free in regard to righteousness.  But what fruit were you getting at that time from the things of which you are now ashamed? The end of those things is death.  But now that you have been _set free from sin and have become slaves of God, the fruit you get leads to sanctification and its end, eternal life.

For there is no distinction: for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God, and are justified by his grace as a gift, through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus, whom God put forward as a propitiation by his blood, *to be received by faith*. This was to show God's righteousness, because in his divine forbearance he had passed over former sins. It was to show his righteousness at the present time, so that he might be just and the justifier of the one who has faith in Jesus. Then what becomes of our boasting? It is excluded.

  *Matthew 19:16-26* - And behold, a man came up to him, saying, Teacher, what good deed must I do to have eternal life? And he said to him, Why do you ask me about what is good? There is only one who is good. If you would enter life, keep the commandments. He said to him, Which ones? And Jesus said, You shall not murder, You shall not commit adultery, You shall not steal, You shall not bear false witness, Honor your father and mother, and, You shall love your neighbor as yourself. The young man said to him, All these I have kept. What do I still lack? Jesus said to him, If you would be perfect, go, sell what you possess and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; and come, follow me. When the young man heard this he went away sorrowful, for he had great possessions. And Jesus said to his disciples, Truly, I say to you, only with difficulty will a rich person enter the kingdom of heaven. Again I tell you, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich person to enter the kingdom of God. When the disciples heard this, they were greatly astonished, saying, Who then can be saved? But Jesus looked at them and said, With man this is impossible, but with God all things are possible.

Jesus immediately reached out his hand and took hold of him, saying to him, O you of little faith, why did you doubt? And when they got into the boat, the wind ceased.

  *Romans 11:29-33*: For the gifts and the calling of God are irrevocable. Just _as you were at one time disobedient to God_ but now have received mercy because of their disobedience, so they too have now been disobedient in order that by the mercy shown to you they also may now receive mercy.

How unsearchable are his judgments and how inscrutable his ways!

The obedient are led by the Spirit of God. But it isn't a Spirit of slavery, it's a Spirit of sonship, where we get to be conformed to the image of Christ!:

For you did not receive the spirit of slavery to fall back into fear, but you have received _the Spirit of adoption as sons, by whom we cry, Abba! Father!_
#+END_QUOTE

Even as we are going through hardship for following Jesus, we should rejoice because we are more than conquerors through Him who loved us:

  *Romans 8:36-39* - As it is written, For your sake we are being killed all the day long; we are regarded as sheep to be slaughtered. No, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him who loved us.

Therefore do not associate with them; for at one time you were darkness, but now you are light in the Lord.

  *Jeremiah 23:1-40* - _Woe to the shepherds who destroy and scatter the sheep of my pasture!_ declares the LORD. Therefore thus says the LORD, the God of Israel, concerning the shepherds who care for my people: You have scattered my flock and have driven them away, and you have not attended to them. Behold, I will attend to you for your evil deeds, declares the LORD. Then I will gather the remnant of my flock out of all the countries where I have driven them, and I will bring them back to their fold, and they shall be fruitful and multiply. _I will set shepherds over them who will care for them, and they shall fear no more, nor be dismayed, neither shall any be missing, declares the LORD._ Behold, the days are coming, declares the LORD, when I will raise up for David a righteous Branch, and he shall reign as king and deal wisely, and shall execute justice and righteousness in the land. In his days Judah will be saved, and Israel will dwell securely. And this is the name by which he will be called: The LORD is our righteousness. Therefore, behold, the days are coming, declares the LORD, when they shall no longer say, As the LORD lives who brought up the people of Israel out of the land of Egypt, but As the LORD lives who brought up and led the offspring of the house of Israel out of the north country and out of all the countries where he had driven them. Then they shall dwell in their own land. Concerning the prophets: My heart is broken within me; all my bones shake; I am like a drunken man, like a man overcome by wine, because of the LORD and because of his holy words. For _the land is full of adulterers;_ because of the curse the land mourns, and the pastures of the wilderness are dried up. Their course is evil, and their might is not right. Both prophet and priest are ungodly; _even in my house I have found their evil,_ declares the LORD. Therefore their way shall be to them like slippery paths in the darkness, into which they shall be driven and fall, for I will bring disaster upon them in the year of their punishment, declares the LORD. In the prophets of Samaria I saw an unsavory thing: they prophesied by Baal and led my people Israel astray. But in the prophets of Jerusalem I have seen a horrible thing: *they commit adultery and walk in lies; they strengthen the hands of evildoers, so that no one turns from his evil;* all of them have become like Sodom to me, and its inhabitants like Gomorrah. Therefore thus says the LORD of hosts concerning the prophets: Behold, I will feed them with bitter food and give them poisoned water to drink, for from the prophets of Jerusalem ungodliness has gone out into all the land. Thus says the LORD of hosts: _Do not listen to the words of the prophets who prophesy to you, filling you with vain hopes. They speak visions of their own minds, not from the mouth of the LORD._ *They say continually to those who despise the word of the LORD, It shall be well with you; and to everyone who stubbornly follows his own heart, they say, No disaster shall come upon you.* For who among them has stood in the council of the LORD to see and to hear his word, or who has paid attention to his word and listened? Behold, the storm of the LORD! Wrath has gone forth, a whirling tempest; it will burst upon the head of the wicked. The anger of the LORD will not turn back until he has executed and accomplished the intents of his heart. In the latter days you will understand it clearly. _I did not send the prophets, yet they ran; I did not speak to them, yet they prophesied._ But if they had stood in my council, then they would have proclaimed my words to my people, and they would have turned them from their evil way, and from the evil of their deeds. Am I a God at hand, declares the LORD, and not a God afar off? Can a man hide himself in secret places so that I cannot see him? declares the LORD. Do I not fill heaven and earth? declares the LORD. _I have heard what the prophets have said who prophesy lies in my name, saying, I have dreamed, I have dreamed! How long shall there be lies in the heart of the prophets who prophesy lies, and who prophesy the deceit of their own heart,_ who think to make my people forget my name by their dreams that they tell one another, even as their fathers forgot my name for Baal? *Let the prophet who has a dream tell the dream, but let him who has my word speak my word faithfully.* What has straw in common with wheat? declares the LORD. Is not my word like fire, declares the LORD, and like a hammer that breaks the rock in pieces? Therefore, behold, I am against the prophets, declares the LORD, who steal my words from one another. Behold, I am against the prophets, declares the LORD, who use their tongues and declare, declares the LORD. _Behold, I am against those who prophesy lying dreams, declares the LORD, and who tell them and lead my people astray by their lies and their recklessness, when I did not send them or charge them._ So they do not profit this people at all, declares the LORD. When one of this people, or a prophet or a priest asks you, What is the burden of the LORD? you shall say to them, You are the burden, and I will cast you off, declares the LORD. And as for the prophet, priest, or one of the people who says, The burden of the LORD, I will punish that man and his household. Thus shall you say, every one to his neighbor and every one to his brother, What has the LORD answered? or What has the LORD spoken? But the burden of the LORD you shall mention no more, for the burden is every man's own word, and _you pervert the words of the living God,_ the LORD of hosts, our God. Thus you shall say to the prophet, What has the LORD answered you? or What has the LORD spoken? But if you say, The burden of the LORD, thus says the LORD, Because you have said these words, The burden of the LORD, when I sent to you, saying, You shall not say, The burden of the LORD, therefore, behold, I will surely lift you up and cast you away from my presence, you and the city that I gave to you and your fathers.

Renovating (bad):
- Disobedient to the gospel
  - Pursues the fruit of righteousness but trying to establish a righteousness of their own without submitting to the righteousness of God.
  - Working for justification outside of faith / obedience
  - Tries to have the 'holiness' without Jesus.
  - Has not obeyed the gospel.
  - Never died with Jesus.
  - From God's perspective even when they forgive others, it's out of self-righteousness.

Innovating (good):
- The fruit of the Spirit is fruit (it comes after receiving *the Holy Spirit*).
- Obey the gospel for justification.
  - Christ is the head.
  - Died and rose with Jesus.
    - *II Timothy 2:11-13* - The saying is trustworthy, for: If we have died with him, we will also live with him; if we endure, we will also reign with him; if we deny him, he also will deny us; if we are faithless, he remains faithful— for he cannot deny himself.
    - *Ephesians 2:6* - and _raised us up with him_ and seated us with him in the heavenly places in Christ Jesus,
    - *Colossians 2:12* - having been _buried with him_ in baptism, in which you were _also raised with him through faith in the powerful working of God_, who raised him from the dead.
      - Raised with Christ through faith in the powerful working of God.

  - Now live to serve Christ.

    - *Colossians 3:1* - If then you have been raised with Christ, seek the things that are above, where Christ is, seated at the right hand of God.
  - Approaches Christ-likeness following Jesus.
  - Having accepted their own need of forgiveness, and having been forgiven *then* forgives others who don't even see their need of forgiveness.
  - *freely* forgives:
    - *Matthew 18:21-22* -  Then Peter came up and said to him, Lord, how often will my brother sin against me, and I forgive him?  As many as seven times?  Jesus said to him, I do not say to you seven times, but seventy times seven. (ESV)
  - forgives even those who do not see their need of forgiveness:
    - *Luke 23:33-35* - And when they came to the place that is called The Skull, there they crucified him, and the criminals, one on his right and one on his left.  And Jesus said, Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do. And they cast lots to divide his garments.

It's necessary to submit to the righteousness of God:
- You have accepted that you needed forgiveness from God.
- You have accepted that it's through the shedding of the blood of Jesus Christ that God has forgiven you, forgiving a debt which was impossible for you to pay.
- Forgive others freely, knowing you've been forgiven of your sin. Give freely. Forgive the debt of others towards you. That looks like being a scapegoat and letting oneself be fleeced. Imagine you've just been born-again but noone else knows. You know you must forgive others. You know God can see your heart. Now all of a sudden people make these claims that you owe them X, Y and Z. You know you've been forgiven of a debt you were not able to pay. Now instead of contesting others on whether or not you owe them, you give freely. Seventy-times-seven.

Self-righteous forgiveness:
- Conditional forgiveness (not freely)
- Self-righteously forgive others as if you're perfectly innocent and of course they sinned against innocence by sinning against you
- Without accepting that you needed the forgiveness which Jesus has paid through His blood, you then forgive others
  - This tries to establish one's own righteousness without submitting to the righteousness of God
- Believing that you're already good with God and never needed Jesus
  - not prepared to forgive freely
  - but not having yet submitted to the fact that you need forgiveness from God.
  - Forgiving others is good to do, but without having truly accepted that you needed forgiveness yourself, you'd still be forgiving others out of debt to God.
  - I think it's impossible to have Christ's heart without having first accepted being forgiven by Jesus
- Do not accept that one needs or ever needed forgiveness from God.
  - That actually means that person's forgiveness is at least a bit self-righteous (at least from God's perspective)
    - They do not give out of credit, but while indebted to God, they still give God what is due by forgiving others their offenses towards them
      - nevertheless, a person can never achieve perfect right standing with God without submitting to the righteousness of God through faith in Christ and accepting the atonement which Jesus has purchased through His blood

The ones who live _not under law_ of God will be thrown into the fiery furnace.

OK, so being led by the Spirit, we still actually comply with the Law of God.
So we must have Christ in us, and being led by the Spirit.

Just as the weeds are gathered and burned with fire, so will it be at the close of the age. The Son of Man will send his angels, _and they will gather out of his kingdom all causes of sin and all law-breakers, and throw them into the fiery furnace_.

We know that Christ being raised from the dead will never die again; death no longer has dominion over him. (ESV)

we live to serve God now, but that isn't achieved by putting ourselves under the Torah, but it *does* mean obeying God through serving Christ:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE

Thus a married woman is bound by law to her husband while he lives, but if her husband dies she is released from the law of marriage. Accordingly, she will be called an adulteress if she lives with another man while her husband is alive. But if her husband dies, she is free from that law, and if she marries another man she is not an adulteress. (ESV)

Knowledge of the Torah appears to 'make sin come alive'. Paul mentions the Law (Torah) as including the commandments:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *Romans 7:8-11* - But sin, seizing an opportunity through the commandment, produced in me all kinds of covetousness. Apart from the law, sin lies dead. I was once alive apart from the law, but when the commandment came, sin came alive and I died. The very commandment that promised life proved to be death to me. For sin, seizing an opportunity through the commandment, deceived me and through it killed me. (ESV)
#+END_QUOTE

OK, so the Law (Torah) and the commandments within are holy and righteous and good, but because of the sin in us, the commandments exposes the sin in us, and even causes it to manifest.

OK, so the way the Law (Torah) currently still exists, while true, is used for us as some kind of means of exposing sin:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *Romans 7:12-13* - So the law is holy, and the commandment is holy and righteous and good. Did that which is good, then, bring death to me? By no means! It was sin, producing death in me through what is good, in order that sin might be shown to be sin, and through the commandment might become sinful beyond measure. (ESV)
#+END_QUOTE

Sin dwells in the flesh and fights against complying with God's commandments:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *Romans 7:14-17* - For we know that the law is spiritual, but I am of the flesh, sold under sin. I do not understand my own actions. For I do not do what I want, but I do the very thing I hate. Now if I do what I do not want, I agree with the law, that it is good. So now it is no longer I who do it, but sin that dwells within me. (ESV)
#+END_QUOTE

In our minds we desire to do what is right by the 10 commandments / Mosaic Law but our flesh creates problems in carrying it out:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *Romans 7:18-24* - For I know that nothing good dwells in me, that is, in my flesh. For I have the desire to do what is right, but not the ability to carry it out. For I do not do the good I want, but the evil I do not want is what I keep on doing. Now if I do what I do not want, it is no longer I who do it, but sin that dwells within me. So I find it to be a law that when I want to do right, evil lies close at hand. For I delight in the law of God, in my inner being, but I see in my members another law waging war against the law of my mind and making me captive to the law of sin that dwells in my members. Wretched man that I am! Who will deliver me from this body of death? (ESV)
#+END_QUOTE

The tragedy is the flesh serves the law of sin, but in with our mind we serve the law of God, but we actually just follow Christ Jesus who has done it already perfectly, and this means we don't make the Mosaic Law our way of life, but we make Jesus our way of life:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE

Christ is alive in us. The body is dead because of sin:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *Romans 8:10-12* - But if Christ is in you, although the body is dead because of sin, the Spirit is life because of righteousness. If the Spirit of him who raised Jesus from the dead dwells in you, he who raised Christ Jesus from the dead will also give life to your mortal bodies through his Spirit who dwells in you. So then, brothers, we are debtors, not to the flesh, to live according to the flesh. (ESV)
#+END_QUOTE

We still have to stop sinning, but this isn't by placing ourselves under the Torah. It's by getting baptised into Christ, serving God, being slaves of Christ, being led by the Spirit, doing the will of God that we put sin to death:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *Romans 8:13-17* - For if you live according to the flesh you will die, but if by the Spirit you put to death the deeds of the body, you will live. For all who are led by the Spirit of God are sons of God. For you did not receive the spirit of slavery to fall back into fear, but you have received the Spirit of adoption as sons, by whom we cry, Abba! Father! The Spirit himself bears witness with our spirit that we are children of God, and if children, then heirs—heirs of God and fellow heirs with Christ, provided we suffer with him in order that we may also be glorified with him. (ESV)

  *Romans 9:30-33* - What shall we say, then? That Gentiles who did not pursue righteousness have attained it, that is, a righteousness that is by faith; but that Israel who pursued a law that would lead to righteousness did not succeed in reaching that law. Why? Because they did not pursue it by faith, but as if it were based on works. They have stumbled over the stumbling stone, as it is written, Behold, I am laying in Zion a stone of stumbling, and a rock of offense; and whoever believes in him will not be put to shame. (ESV)

Paul prays for Israel to be saved, saying they have a zeal for God, but not by actual knowledge of God:

For, being ignorant of the righteousness that comes from God, and seeking to establish their own, they did not submit to God's righteousness.
#+END_QUOTE

OK, so we need to submit to God's righteousness, and that means having faith in God for what He has done sending Jesus Christ to die on the cross for our sin and raising Him for our justification.

We need to receive the Spirit of God:

Instead of thinking we must make the Torah our way of life, we simply make Jesus our Lord and Saviour:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *Romans 10:5-9* - For Moses writes about the righteousness that is based on the law, that the person who does the commandments shall live by them. But the righteousness based on faith says, Do not say in your heart, Who will ascend into heaven? (that is, to bring Christ down) or Who will descend into the abyss? (that is, to bring Christ up from the dead). But what does it say? The word is near you, in your mouth and in your heart (that is, the word of faith that we proclaim); because, if you confess with your mouth that Jesus is Lord and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved. (ESV)

** The Torah
The Torah is the compilation of the first five books of the Hebrew Bible, namely the books of Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers and Deuteronomy. The Torah is known as the Pentateuch or the Five Books of Moses by Christians.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *II Timothy 3:12-17* - Indeed, _all who desire to live a godly life in Christ Jesus will be persecuted,_ while evil people and impostors will go on from bad to worse, deceiving and being deceived. But as for you, continue in what you have learned and have firmly believed, knowing from whom you learned it and how from childhood you have been *acquainted with the sacred writings*, which _are able to make you wise for salvation through faith in Christ Jesus_. All Scripture is breathed out by God and profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, and for _training in righteousness, that the man of God may be competent, equipped for every good work._ (ESV)

Keeping to _the precepts of the law_ is great, and making yourself accountable to God with it, is great.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *Proverbs 28:9* - If one turns away his ear from hearing the law, even his prayer is an abomination. (ESV)
#+END_QUOTE

Here, Paul actually argues *for* keeping the precepts of the Torah, and relates actually keeping the precepts to those who have been circumcised in the heart:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *Romans 2:25-29* - For circumcision indeed is of value if you obey the law, but if you break the law, your circumcision becomes uncircumcision. So, if a man who is uncircumcised keeps _the precepts of the law_, will not his uncircumcision be regarded as circumcision? Then he who is physically uncircumcised but keeps the law will condemn you who have the written code and circumcision but break the law. For no one is a Jew who is merely one outwardly, nor is circumcision outward and physical. But _a Jew is one inwardly, and circumcision is a matter of the heart, by the Spirit, not by the letter._ His praise is not from man but from God.
#+END_QUOTE

I believe what Paul says here is that Christians who observe and follow the Torah in faith, not works, not being under it (because it doesn't condemn us while we are under Christ's law), but making themselves accountable to God over it, to receive praise from God, are Christian Jews. But we don't Judaise Gentiles. And we follow Jesus Christ above all. We are slaves to Jesus Christ, not the Mosaic Law.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *Luke 16:15-17* - And he said to them, You are those who justify yourselves before men, but God knows your hearts. For what is exalted among men is an abomination in the sight of God.

* Whoever puts their faith in Jesus, puts their faith in God
We must follow Jesus, similarly to how the Israelites followed Moses through the Red Sea - it requires action.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *John 12:44-50* - And Jesus cried out and said, Whoever believes (G4100 pisteuo) in me, believes (G4100 pisteuo) not in me but in him who sent me.  And whoever sees me sees him who sent me.  I have come into the world as light, so that whoever believes in me may not remain in darkness.  If anyone hears my words and does not keep them, I do not judge him; for I did not come to judge the world but to save the world.  The one who rejects me and does not receive my words has a judge; the word that I have spoken will judge him on the last day.  For I have not spoken on my own authority, but the Father who sent me has himself given me a commandment—what to say and what to speak.  And I know that his commandment is eternal life.  What I say, therefore, I say as the Father has told me. (ESV)

For when Gentiles, who do not have the law, by nature do what the law requires, they are a law to themselves, even though they do not have the law.  They show that the work of the law is written on their hearts, while their conscience also bears witness, and their conflicting thoughts accuse or even excuse them on that day when, according to my gospel, God judges the secrets of men by Christ Jesus.

* Mosaic Law, and progressing from having hope in Moses to having hope in Jesus
I enjoyed this video, but I still am of the opinion that _keeping_ the Mosaic law is not necessary, placing oneself under it (to adhere strictly to it) is contrary to grace,
but _following it by faith_ (receiving our justification from Jesus by obedience to Jesus) is not prohibited, so long as it is pursued by faith and submitting to God's righteousness:
- [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNHKqhwu6Bo][Public Debate - Should Christians Keep The Law? - YouTube]]
- The law is good and just and Jesus both obeyed it flawlessly, but He also fulfilled it like a prophesy.

Christians follow Jesus first and foremost:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *Matthew 12:3-8* - He said to them, Have you not read what David did when he was hungry, and those who were with him: how he entered the house of God and ate the bread of the Presence, which it was not lawful for him to eat nor for those who were with him, but only for the priests? Or have you not read in the Law how on the Sabbath the priests in the temple profane the Sabbath and are guiltless? I tell you, *something greater than the temple is here.* And *if you had known what this means, I desire mercy, and not sacrifice, you would not have condemned the guiltless.* For *the Son of Man is lord of the Sabbath.*

Lay aside, therefore, the evil, the old, the sour leaven, and be ye changed into the new leaven, which is Jesus Christ. Be ye salted in Him, lest any one among you should be corrupted, since by your savour ye shall be convicted. It is absurd to profess Christ Jesus, and to Judaize.

I read the following as, as we have faith in Jesus, following Him, where we have fallen short, Jesus has covered us, but we still try to live righteously. We still live with faith in God.

And when we continue to sin, Jesus is our High Priest and Advocate, and covers us, as we continue to have faith in Him.

The 10 Commandments and the 2 Great commandments are special because when followed *from the heart* they show people how to love God and one's neighbour.

And we are _commanded_ (even as Christians not _under the law_) to love our neighbours:

The rest of the Mosaic law is still useful for training in righteousness. It shows people how to live in obedience to God and in love for God and one's neighbour. But we are not under the Mosaic law, but we are under the law of Christ. We have faith in Christ.

We can pursue the righteousness that is through faith (G4100 *pisteuo*) in Jesus Christ.

We must set our hope on Jesus, not on Moses.

And the LORD said to me, They are right in what they have spoken. I will raise up for them a prophet like you from among their brothers.

By having an obedient, trusting faith (which fundamentally includes belief) in Jesus, following, we have Jesus' righteousness.

I read this as we are under grace and not

of repentance from disbelief and sin, and

in our life which glorifies God in our bodies,
hearts and deeds:
- obedience leads to righteousness
- slaves to righteousness leading to sanctification
  - at its end, eternal life

  *Romans 6:13-23* - Do not present your members to sin as instruments for unrighteousness, but present yourselves to God as those who have been brought from death to life, and your members to God as instruments for righteousness.

Do you not know that if you present yourselves to anyone as obedient slaves, you are slaves of the one whom you obey, either of sin, which leads to death, or of *obedience, which leads to righteousness*?  But thanks be to God, that you who were once slaves of sin have become obedient *from the heart* to the standard of teaching to which you were committed, and, having been set free from sin, have become *slaves of righteousness*.  I am speaking in human terms, because of your natural limitations. For just as you once presented your members as slaves to impurity and to lawlessness leading to more lawlessness, so now present your members as *slaves to righteousness leading to sanctification*.  When you were slaves of sin, you were free in regard to righteousness.  But what fruit were you getting at that time from the things of which you are now ashamed? The end of those things is death.  But now that you have been *set free from sin and have become slaves of God, the fruit you get leads to sanctification and its end, eternal life*.  For the wages of sin is death, but the free gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.

*** Jesus' commandments don't contradict the rest of the commandments
Also God's commandments (especially the 10 Commandments; loving God and your neighbour) are still binding on us - written on our heart when we get born-again and after being born-again we follow them in Spirit, but they don't bind on us in a way that condemns us if we  break them, but we *want* to follow them.

Jesus fulfilled the law => We have the Spirit of Christ => We are led by the Spirit and naturally want to follow the law in faith but the world opposes us because when a person actually follows the commandments, they do not lie, do not commit adultery, do not commit idolatry, etc. and that means a person can be 'taken advantage of' by unfaithful people who do not obey God's commandments but exploit others who follow God.

But we neither pursue the law by works, nor seek it to be justified.
We are freed from being under the law, and free from the curse of the law to serve and obey God in actuality, being under God's grace.

*** However, we must submit to God's righteousness through faith in Jesus Christ - this is what saves
It's not with the mind that a person believes, but with the heart:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *Romans 10:6-13* - But the righteousness based on faith says, Do not say in your heart, Who will ascend into heaven? (that is, to bring Christ down) or Who will descend into the abyss? (that is, to bring Christ up from the dead).  But what does it say? The word is near you, in your mouth and in your heart (that is, the word of faith that we proclaim); because, if you confess with your mouth that Jesus is Lord and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved.  For *with the heart one believes (G4100 pisteuo) and is justified*, and with the mouth one confesses and is saved.  For the Scripture says, Everyone who believes in him will not be put to shame.  For there is no distinction between Jew and Greek; the same Lord is Lord of all, bestowing his riches on all who call on him.  For everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved.
#+END_QUOTE

But what does it take for the _heart_ to truly believe? Because that's the condition. When the heart truly believes, a person is obedient.

More obedience may still need to take place for that individual to arrive at justifying faith, and God may be allowing you to come to your faith.

To be justified, a person must _walk in the footsteps of the faith that our father Abraham had before he was circumcised_.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *Romans 4:9-12* - Is this blessing then only for the circumcised, or also for the uncircumcised? We say that faith was counted to Abraham as righteousness. How then was it counted to him? Was it before or after he had been circumcised? It was not after, but before he was circumcised. He received the sign of circumcision as a seal of the righteousness that he had by faith while he was still uncircumcised. The purpose was to make him the father of all who believe without being circumcised, so that righteousness would be counted to them as well, and to make him the father of the circumcised who are _not merely circumcised but who also walk in the footsteps of the faith that our father Abraham had before he was circumcised_.
#+END_QUOTE

It does say '*you will be saved*', not '*you are saved*'.

And the word *confess* I think means to admit with repentance - an admission of guilt to God and change of mind resulting in confessing that Jesus is Lord and that God indeed raised Him from the dead, and that you needed Him to do so, because His name means Jesus (The LORD Saves), Christ (Annointed Messiah, Saviour), Son of God.

If a person confesses this truthfully, they professes that they submit to the righteousness of God.

That's a little bit loaded. It results in a heart growing in obedience towards God.
And I believe it's the resulting obedience to God that ends up saving that person, even if that obedience hasn't produced any work yet other than belief. God is the one that saves and justifies.

Then Jesus hits us with this:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *John 15:16* - You did not choose me, but I chose you and appointed you that you should go and bear fruit and that your fruit should abide, so that whatever you ask the Father in my name, he may give it to you.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *Ephesians 1:4* - even as he chose us in him before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy and blameless before him. In love
#+END_QUOTE

So while we might think we have done something, God had planned it in advance, and the entire thing is grace - but that doesn't mean from our perspective it does not look like we need to obey God - because we still need to have faith and do something. And if we don't do anything then we are asking God to do it for us.

Since the Bible does not teach that all people will be saved because they remain disobedient, I think we should teach people that they should do something; That they should repent from sin and they should repent from unbelief if they want to be saved from sin and leading to death, and if they want to enter into the light of the truth, and enter into a relationship with God.

The root of disobedience/rebellion is unbelief/denial.

He will wipe away every tear from their eyes, and death shall be no more, neither shall there be mourning nor crying nor pain anymore, for the former things have passed away. And he who was seated on the throne said, Behold, I am making all things new. Also he said, Write this down, for these words are trustworthy and true. And he said to me, It is done! I am the Alpha and the Omega, the beginning and the end. To the thirsty I will give from the spring of the water of life without payment. The one who conquers will have this heritage, and I will be his God and he will be my son.

The righteousness we have through faith in Jesus Christ is needed whether someone keeps the Mosaic law or not.

Not that I keep the Mosaic law in its entirety, nor are circumcised. But I try to keep the Great commandments
and the 10 Commandments out of faith (and a relationship with God) and follow parts of the Mosaic law,
but I have faith in Jesus Christ for the righteousness that comes through faith because I need that because my own
righteousness will never be enough without faith in Jesus for God's righteousness imputed to me.

Thank You God.

* Jesus fulfilled the law
- Who gave Moses the law and the instructions to build the tabernacle? God did.
  - The blueprints came from God.
- The Law, the Psalms and the Prophets all point to Jesus.
- Moses wrote about Jesus.
- Jesus fulfilled the Law and the prophecies.

We still follow the law but by faith and not by works.

We keep accountability with God, and in truth over following the law - God knows when we lie, cheat, commit adultery, idolise etc.
We follow the law in truth.
Jesus fulfilled the law. Jesus' blood is the atonement for sin.
So we go to Jesus for forgiveness instead of perform the ceremonial law to try to make atonement for sin.

The unrepentant sinner wanted Jesus to save his present life:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *Luke 23:39* - One of the criminals who were hanged there was hurling abuse at Him, saying, “Are You not the Christ? Save Yourself and us!”
#+END_QUOTE

The repentant sinner feared God and put his hope on Jesus Christ, not to save him from the cross, but to save his soul:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *Luke 23:40-43* - But the other answered, and rebuking him said, “Do you not even fear God, since you are under the same sentence of condemnation? And we indeed are suffering justly, for we are receiving what we deserve for our deeds; but this man has done nothing wrong.” And he was saying, “Jesus, remember me when You come in Your kingdom!” And He said to him, “Truly I say to you, today you shall be with Me in Paradise.”
#+END_QUOTE

A _key thing_ here is that the repentant sinner didn't value his present life, and didn't care to ask Jesus to save his present life on earth. The repentant sinner had come to the end of caring about his present life, and put his trust in Jesus. This is what we should do, and it looks like sacrificing the present life to follow Jesus. And I believe that to someone who isn't literally at the end of their earthly life that looks like repentance from sin and an obedient heart, serving Jesus. You can see that he had a _changed heart_, and was remorseful. He knew he was being justly punished. And he had the heart to want to follow Jesus.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *Luke 9:23-24* - And he said to all, If anyone would come after me, let him deny himself and take up his cross daily and follow me. For whoever would save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for my sake will save it. (ESV)

While Jesus can save someone from dying, I think eternal life the way it's presented is more than that - it's becoming a part of the Truth - it's union with Christ and with God.

He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches.’
#+END_QUOTE

James isn't talking about work of the law, he's talking about the works of faith.

God desires us to have mercy.

There are a lot of 'do nots' in the law but the most important thing is the 2 'do' commandments.
The 'do nots' are to stop people from doing bad things, but the 2 Greatest commandments command us to love God and our neighbour.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *Matthew 22:37-40* - And he said to him, You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind. This is the great and first commandment. And a second is like it: You shall love your neighbor as yourself. On these two commandments depend all the Law and the Prophets.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *James 2:13-17* - For judgment is without mercy to one who has shown no mercy. Mercy triumphs over judgment. What good is it, my brothers, if someone says he has faith but does not have works? Can that faith save him? If a brother or sister is poorly clothed and lacking in daily food, and one of you says to them, Go in peace, be warmed and filled, without giving them the things needed for the body, what good is that? So also faith by itself, if it does not have works, is dead.

MERCY.

Or have you not read in the Law how on the Sabbath the priests in the temple profane the Sabbath and are guiltless? I tell you, something greater than the temple is here. And *if you had known what this means, I desire mercy, and not sacrifice, you would not have condemned the guiltless.* For the Son of Man is lord of the Sabbath.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *II Thessalonians 2:10-13* - and with all the deception of wickedness for those who perish, because they did not receive the love of the truth so as to be saved. For this reason God will send upon them a deluding influence so that they will believe what is false, in order that they all may be judged who did not believe the truth, but took pleasure in wickedness. But we should always give thanks to God for you, brethren beloved by the Lord, because God has chosen you from the beginning for _salvation through sanctification by the Spirit and faith in the truth_.
#+END_QUOTE

The Spirit sanctifies as we have faith in the truth.
The faith in the truth is the cooperative part, where we obey the truth.

** Working faith / faith with substance

Faith is a relationship with God. God has promised inheriting the Kingdom, inheriting eternal life to those who obey Him. But God is sovereign to save.

I made these equations to describe my understanding that faith is actually closely related to belief, obedience, hope and love, and they actually are not completely separate things.

  Faith-in-God = Hope-from/in-God * Work/Love

  Hope-from/in-God = Belief(believing God) * Truth(God's word is truth)

  Work/Love = Obedience * Faithfulness * Fear-of-God * Response-of-love-to-Jesus * Patient-Endurance(time)

  Obedience = Submitting to the Righteousness of God * Turning from sin, loving, showing mercy, etc.

  Fear-of-God = e.g. The poor in spirit recognise their need of God's mercy and tremble at His Word: "beat his breast, saying, God, be merciful to me, a sinner!"

  Response-of-love-to-Jesus = e.g. praise, thankfulness, obeying His commandments

  Love is proportional-to the baggage which has been forgiven
  Love ∝ forgiven-baggage

  Obedience ∝ Love

  F = H * L
  Faith = Hope * Love

  Faith-in-God when tested by God is found to be true Faith in God.
  Faith-in-God must submit to the Righteousness of God through faith in Jesus Christ,
  Jesus Christ having paid the price of sin, enabling a relationship with God.

# *Hebrews 10:5-14* - Consequently, when Christ came into the world, he said, Sacrifices and offerings you have not desired, but a body have you prepared for me; in burnt offerings and sin offerings you have taken no pleasure. Then I said, Behold, I have come to do your will, O God, as it is written of me in the scroll of the book. When he said above, You have _neither desired nor taken pleasure in sacrifices and offerings and burnt offerings and sin offerings_ (_these are offered according to the law_), then he added, Behold, I have come to do your will. He abolishes the first in order to establish the second. And by that will we have been sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all. And every priest stands daily at his service, offering repeatedly the same sacrifices, which can never take away sins. right hand of God, waiting from that time until his enemies should be made a footstool for his feet. For by a single offering he has perfected for all time those who are being sanctified.

And Jesus said, You shall not murder, You shall not commit adultery, You shall not steal, You shall not bear false witness, Honor your father and mother, and, You shall love your neighbor as yourself. The young man said to him, All these I have kept. What do I still lack? Jesus said to him, If you would be perfect, go, sell what you possess and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; and come, follow me. When the young man heard this he went away sorrowful, for he had great possessions. And Jesus said to his disciples, Truly, I say to you, only with difficulty will a rich person enter the kingdom of heaven. Again I tell you, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich person to enter the kingdom of God.

Also, _most importantly_ believe in the atonement which Jesus provides:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *John 6:55-71* - For my flesh is true food, and my blood is true drink. Whoever feeds on my flesh and drinks my blood abides in me, and I in him. As the living Father sent me, and I live because of the Father, so whoever feeds on me, he also will live because of me. This is the bread that came down from heaven, not as the fathers ate and died. Whoever feeds on this bread will live forever. Jesus said these things in the synagogue, as he taught at Capernaum. When many of his disciples heard it, they said, This is a hard saying; who can listen to it? But Jesus, knowing in himself that his disciples were grumbling about this, said to them, Do you take offense at this? Then what if you were to see the Son of Man ascending to where he was before? It is the Spirit who gives life; the flesh is of no avail. The words that I have spoken to you are spirit and life. But there are some of you who do not believe. (For Jesus knew from the beginning who those were who did not believe, and who it was who would betray him. )
#+END_QUOTE

Both free grace and Lordship are required.

If either the atonement is rejected or Jesus' Lordship is rejected, I think both groups of people who have rejected atonement or Lordship will be rejected.
And I define Lordship as obeying Jesus Christ, and I define obeying Jesus Christ as obeying His commandments; not just sharing the gospel but also His commandment to love others in the same way that He has loved us.
However, if someone hasn't heard the good news yet, but lives righteously then God will judge that person fairly, I think.

Also, _most importantly,_ become obedient to Jesus:
- Obey Jesus' commandments
- Do not follow the pattern of this world; leave this world behind

Not everyone who says to me, Lord, Lord, will enter the kingdom of heaven, but the one who does the will of my Father who is in heaven.

Again he sent other servants, more than the first. And they did the same to them. Finally he sent his son to them, saying, They will respect my son. But when the tenants saw the son, they said to themselves, This is the heir. Come, let us kill him and have his inheritance. And they took him and threw him out of the vineyard and killed him. When therefore the owner of the vineyard comes, what will he do to those tenants? They said to him, He will put those wretches to a miserable death and let out the vineyard to other tenants who will give him the fruits in their seasons.

# *I Peter 2:6-25* - For it stands in Scripture: Behold, I am laying in Zion a stone, a cornerstone chosen and precious, and whoever believes in him will not be put to shame. So _the honor is for you who believe_, but for those who do not believe, The stone that the builders rejected has become the cornerstone, and A stone of stumbling, and a rock of offense. They stumble because they disobey the word, as they were destined to do. But you are a chosen race, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people for his own possession, that you may _proclaim the excellencies of him who called you out of darkness into his marvelous light._ Once you were not a people, but now you are God's people; once you had not received mercy, but now you have received mercy. Beloved, I urge you as sojourners and exiles to abstain from the passions of the flesh, which wage war against your soul. Keep your conduct among the Gentiles honorable, so that when they speak against you as evildoers, they may see your good deeds and glorify God on the day of visitation. Be subject for the Lord's sake to every human institution, whether it be to the emperor as supreme, or to governors as sent by him to punish those who do evil and to praise those who do good. For this is the will of God, that by doing good you should put to silence the ignorance of foolish people. Live as people who are free, not using your freedom as a cover-up for evil, but living as servants of God. Honor everyone. Love the brotherhood. Fear God. Honor the emperor. Servants, be subject to your masters with all respect, not only to the good and gentle but also to the unjust. For this is a gracious thing, when, mindful of God, one endures sorrows while suffering unjustly. For what credit is it if, when you sin and are beaten for it, you endure? But if when you do good and suffer for it you endure, this is a gracious thing in the sight of God. For to this you have been called, because Christ also suffered for you, leaving you an example, so that you might follow in his steps. He committed no sin, neither was deceit found in his mouth. When he was reviled, he did not revile in return; when he suffered, he did not threaten, but continued entrusting himself to him who judges justly. He himself bore our sins in his body on the tree, that we might die to sin and live to righteousness. By his wounds you have been healed. For you were straying like sheep, but have now returned to the Shepherd and Overseer of your souls.

But at midnight there was a cry, Here is the bridegroom! Come out to meet him. Then all those virgins rose and trimmed their lamps. And the foolish said to the wise, Give us some of your oil, for our lamps are going out. But the wise answered, saying, Since there will not be enough for us and for you, go rather to the dealers and buy for yourselves. And while they were going to buy, the bridegroom came, and those who were ready went in with him to the marriage feast, and the door was shut. Afterward the other virgins came also, saying, Lord, lord, open to us. But he answered, Truly, I say to you, I do not know you. Watch therefore, for you know neither the day nor the hour.

He who had received the five talents went at once and traded with them, and he made five talents more. So also he who had the two talents made two talents more. But he who had received the one talent went and dug in the ground and hid his master's money. Now after a long time the master of those servants came and settled accounts with them. And he who had received the five talents came forward, bringing five talents more, saying, Master, you delivered to me five talents; here I have made five talents more. His master said to him, *Well done, good and faithful servant. You have been faithful over a little; I will set you over much*. Enter into the joy of your master. And he also who had the two talents came forward, saying, Master, you delivered to me two talents; here I have made two talents more. His master said to him, Well done, good and faithful servant. You have been faithful over a little; I will set you over much. Enter into the joy of your master. He also who had received the one talent came forward, saying, Master, I knew you to be a hard man, reaping where you did not sow, and gathering where you scattered no seed, so I was afraid, and I went and hid your talent in the ground. Here you have what is yours. But his master answered him, You wicked and slothful servant! You knew that I reap where I have not sowed and gather where I scattered no seed? Then you ought to have invested my money with the bankers, and at my coming I should have received what was my own with interest. So take the talent from him and give it to him who has the ten talents. *For to everyone who has will more be given, and he will have an abundance. But from the one who has not, even what he has will be taken away. And cast the worthless servant into the outer darkness*. In that place there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth. (ESV)

And he will place the sheep on his right, but the goats on the left.

God spoke to Abram first, and then Abram *obeyed*.
Abraham was faithful.
God noticed Abram's faithfulness, and told Abram he would be rewarded.
God gave Abram a promise.
Abram believed God.

But God made the first move.
The first move from Abraham's perspective was obedience, followed by belief.

The Lord God spoke first - this itself is a gift. We have the Bible and the testimony of others as a gift from God.
We must then believe what is said in the Holy Scriptures and trust it and obey it (put into practice).

To follow the law by faith, I think, is to not lie, commit adultery, idolize, etc. in truth and reality, keeping yourself accountable to God.

This is the key, I think, to following the law by faith: *praise from God and not men*.

Faith eclipses the law:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *Romans 4:9-12* - Is this blessing then only for the circumcised, or also for the uncircumcised? We say that faith was counted to Abraham as righteousness. How then was it counted to him? Was it before or after he had been circumcised? It was not after, but before he was circumcised. He received the sign of circumcision as a seal of the righteousness that he had by faith while he was still uncircumcised. The purpose was to make him the father of all who believe without being circumcised, so that righteousness would be counted to them as well, and to make him the father of the circumcised who are _not merely circumcised but who also walk in the footsteps of the faith that our father Abraham had before he was circumcised_.

The ones under the law who also walk in the footsteps of the faith that Abraham had before he was circumcised, come under the umbrella of the faith of Abraham, which the Gentiles who also share the faith of Abraham are included within.

But before and/or after believing and being forgiven a person needs to also turn away from sin.

I am speaking in human terms, because of your natural limitations. For just as you once presented your members as slaves to impurity and to lawlessness leading to more lawlessness, so now present your members as slaves to righteousness leading to sanctification. When you were slaves of sin, you were free in regard to righteousness. But what fruit were you getting at that time from the things of which you are now ashamed? The end of those things is death.

I think faith is like casting a net to receive something.

If you want to catch something big then you need a lot of faith.

Faith receives salvation, and salvation is the gift which is received through faith.
Faith is something which a person must have to receive the free gift.
The onus is on us to receive the free gift.

We must approach Jesus.
We must repent (change our minds, turning from our wicked ways, and turn to God) and obey God.
God has said many things, about his statutes and about how we should listen to Jesus.
I think repentance (*from the heart* turning from sin) is still approaching Jesus because Jesus fulfilled the law.

Humble yourself and obey God's commandments (not out of pride, but out of authentic faith with God, being accountable to God, in secret).

For example, abstaining from partaking in stealing, or adultery and being faithful to God, even if you lose friends over it.
This type of obeying God's commandments is nothing to do with pride or self-exultation or self-righteousness and everything to do with being faithful to God and humbling oneself to God.

Trying to turn from sin in truth and reality.

Work substantiates faith because it is the act of receiving from God.

A work of faith could indeed be following the law in faith (as opposed to following the law by works).

For example, keeping your integrity, remaining faithful to God and not lying to God.

Patient endurance is a 'work of faith'.

  *James 2:22-26* - You see that faith was active along with his works, and faith was completed by his works; and the Scripture was fulfilled that says, Abraham believed God, and it was counted to him as righteousness-and he was called a friend of God. You see that a person is justified by works and not by faith alone. And in the same way was not also Rahab the prostitute justified by works when she received the messengers and sent them out by another way? For as the body apart from the spirit is dead, so also faith apart from works is dead. (ESV)

* The Kingdom of God
After I got born-again I started getting dreams with themes of the 'Kingdom of God', and also through interactions I began having with people, while I was pursuing following Jesus' commandments, etc. So my 'evidence' is a personal conviction that comes through faith in Jesus which has been working.

That's how I interpret how the following passage says that the Kingdom of God is not coming with signs to be observed:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *Luke 17:20-21* - Being asked by the Pharisees when the kingdom of God would come, he answered them, The kingdom of God is not coming with signs to be observed, nor will they say, Look, here it is! or There! for behold, the _kingdom of God is in the midst of you._
#+END_QUOTE

* Entering and inheriting the kingdom
There's so much stuff to do to enter the kingdom... I feel entirely unworthy.

Firstly, it has been by grace because I asked God to save me, even when I was very much stuck in sin. And I still _feel_ as though I am approaching it and haven't quite entered it (just being honest here).

Those who hunger and thirst for righteousness will be satisfied.

Please God, give me the righteousness required to enter the kingdom.

Zacchaeus was repentant, and was saved through Jesus as he had the faith of Abraham, but towards Jesus:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *Luke 19:1-10* - He entered Jericho and was passing through. And there was a man named Zacchaeus. He was a chief tax collector and was rich. And he was seeking to see who Jesus was, but on account of the crowd he could not, because he was small of stature. So he ran on ahead and climbed up into a sycamore tree to see him, for he was about to pass that way. And when Jesus came to the place, he looked up and said to him, Zacchaeus, hurry and come down, for I must stay at your house today. So he hurried and came down and received him joyfully. And when they saw it, they all grumbled, He has gone in to be the guest of a man who is a sinner. And Zacchaeus stood and said to the Lord, Behold, Lord, the half of my goods I give to the poor. And if I have defrauded anyone of anything, I restore it fourfold. And Jesus said to him, _Today salvation has come to this house, since he also is a son of Abraham. For the Son of Man came to seek and to save the lost._ (ESV)

** We've died to sin, now we live to Christ, and do not allow sin back in
We are slaves of righteousness now - we must obey God, keeping sin dead:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *Romans 6:1* - What shall we say then? Are we to continue in sin that grace may abound? By no means! How can we who died to sin still live in it? Do you not know that all of us who have been baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into his death? We were buried therefore with him by baptism into death, in order that, just as Christ was raised from the dead by the glory of the Father, we too might walk in newness of life. For *if we have been united with him in a death like his, we shall certainly be united with him in a resurrection like his*. We know that our old self was crucified with him in order that the body of sin might be brought to nothing, so that we would no longer be enslaved to sin. For one who has died has been set free from sin. Now if we have died with Christ, we believe that we will also live with him. We know that Christ being raised from the dead will never die again; death no longer has dominion over him. For the death he died he died to sin, once for all, but *the life he lives he lives to God.* So you also must consider yourselves dead to sin and alive to God in Christ Jesus.
#+END_QUOTE

Do not make sin come alive again, but be a slave of righteousness - *be obedient* as it leads to righteousness:

  *Romans 6:12-16* - Let not sin therefore reign in your mortal bodies, to make you obey their passions. Do not present your members to sin as instruments for unrighteousness, but present yourselves to God as those who have been brought from death to life, and your members to God as instruments for righteousness. For sin will have no dominion over you, since you are not under law but under grace. What then? Are we to sin because we are not under law but under grace? By no means! Do you not know that if you present yourselves to anyone as obedient slaves, you are slaves of the one whom you obey, either of sin, which leads to death, or of *obedience, which leads to righteousness?*
#+END_QUOTE

We must be slaves to righteousness, which leads to our sanctification:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *Romans 6:17-21* - But thanks be to God, that you who were once slaves of sin have become obedient *from the heart* to the standard of teaching to which you were committed, and, having been set free from sin, have become slaves of righteousness. I am speaking in human terms, because of your natural limitations. For just as you once presented your members as slaves to impurity and to lawlessness leading to more lawlessness, so now present your members as *slaves to righteousness leading to sanctification.* When you were slaves of sin, you were free in regard to righteousness. But what fruit were you getting at that time from the things of which you are now ashamed? The end of those things is death.
#+END_QUOTE

At the end of sanctification is eternal life:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *Romans 6:22-23* - But now that you have been set free from sin and have become slaves of God, the fruit you get leads to sanctification and its end, eternal life. For the wages of sin is death, but the free gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.

Whoever practices righteousness is righteous, as he is righteous.  Whoever makes a practice of sinning is of the devil, for the devil has been sinning from the beginning.  The reason the Son of God appeared was to destroy the works of the devil.  No one born of God makes a practice of sinning, for God's seed abides in him, and he cannot keep on sinning because he has been born of God.  (ESV)

Get intimate with Jesus - *really* intimate.

I believe this means to become a disciple of Jesus and become one in spirit with Jesus; to think like Jesus, to walk as Jesus walked, to love God and obey God as Jesus did, even if one is persecuted for being righteous as happened to Jesus, to do as Jesus commanded, to become one in spirit with Jesus. Also, taking communion is about that.

  *John 6:53-58* - So Jesus said to them, Truly, truly, I say to you, unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink his blood, you have no life in you.  Whoever feeds on my flesh and drinks my blood has eternal life, and I will raise him up on the last day.  For my flesh is true food, and my blood is true drink.  Whoever feeds on my flesh and drinks my blood abides in me, and I in him.  As the living Father sent me, and I live because of the Father, so whoever feeds on me, he also will live because of me.  This is the bread that came down from heaven, not as the fathers ate and died. Whoever feeds on this bread will live forever.

We remember Jesus as we take communion:
- We give thanks to God
- We proclaim the Lord Jesus' death until He comes
- We examine ourselves and compare our hearts to the heart of the Lord Jesus
- We consider what our Lord Jesus has done for us on the cross
- Before we take communion, we want to examine our own heart to see how we could be more like Jesus
  - How we can be more selfless
  - How we can be more loving
  - How we can be more like disciples of Jesus
  - How we can be more trusting of Jesus
    - How we can be more believing of who He is and believing of His atoning sacrifice
    - How we can be more obedient to His commandments
- We believe that Jesus will return

  *I Corinthians 11:24-29* - and when he had given thanks, he broke it, and said, This is my body which is for you. Do this in remembrance of me.  In the same way also he took the cup, after supper, saying, This cup is the new covenant in my blood. Do this, as often as you drink it, in remembrance of me.  For as often as you eat this bread and drink the cup, you proclaim the Lord's death until he comes.  Whoever, therefore, eats the bread or drinks the cup of the Lord in an unworthy manner will be guilty of profaning the body and blood of the Lord.  Let a person examine himself, then, and so eat of the bread and drink of the cup.  For anyone who eats and drinks without discerning the body eats and drinks judgment on himself.

I believe that taking the Eucharist absolutely has spiritual and physical effects, and the body and blood of Jesus are received through faith.

  *I Corinthians 11:30* - That is why many of you are weak and ill, and some have died.  But if we judged ourselves truly, we would not be judged.  But when we are judged by the Lord, we are disciplined so that we may not be condemned along with the world.

  *I Corinthians 10:16-18* - The cup of blessing that we bless, is it not a participation in the blood of Christ? The bread that we break, is it not a participation in the body of Christ?

Then what if you were to see the Son of Man ascending to where he was before?  It is the Spirit who gives life; the flesh is of no avail. The words that I have spoken to you are spirit and life.  But there are some of you who do not believe.

The disciples said to him, Rabbi, the Jews were just now seeking to stone you, and are you going there again? Jesus answered, Are there not twelve hours in the day? If anyone walks in the day, he does not stumble, because he sees the light of this world. But if anyone walks in the night, he stumbles, because the light is not in him. (ESV)

Interestingly, Jesus goes confidently back to Judea where the disciples were worried he would be stoned, but instead of someone killing Jesus, Jesus resurrects Lazarus. I guess it pays to walk while you have the light.

But even if we or an angel from heaven should preach to you a gospel contrary to the one we preached to you, let him be accursed. As we have said before, so now I say again: If anyone is preaching to you a gospel contrary to the one you received, let him be accursed. For am I now seeking the approval of man, or of God? Or am I trying to please man? If I were still trying to please man, I would not be a servant of Christ. (ESV)

  *Micah 4:1-13* - It shall come to pass in the latter days that the mountain of the house of the LORD shall be established as the highest of the mountains, and it shall be lifted up above the hills; and peoples shall flow to it, and many nations shall come, and say: Come, let us go up to the mountain of the LORD, to the house of the God of Jacob, that he may teach us his ways and that we may walk in his paths. For out of Zion shall go forth the law, and the word of the LORD from Jerusalem. He shall judge between many peoples, and shall decide for strong nations afar off; and they shall beat their swords into plowshares, and their spears into pruning hooks; nation shall not lift up sword against nation, neither shall they learn war anymore; but they shall sit every man under his vine and under his fig tree, and no one shall make them afraid, for the mouth of the LORD of hosts has spoken. For all the peoples walk each in the name of its god, but we will walk in the name of the LORD our God forever and ever. In that day, declares the LORD, I will assemble the lame and gather those who have been driven away and those whom I have afflicted; and the lame I will make the remnant, and those who were cast off, a strong nation; and the LORD will reign over them in Mount Zion from this time forth and forevermore. And you, O tower of the flock, hill of the daughter of Zion, to you shall it come, the former dominion shall come, kingship for the daughter of Jerusalem. Now why do you cry aloud? Is there no king in you? Has your counselor perished, that pain seized you like a woman in labor? Writhe and groan, O daughter of Zion, like a woman in labor, for now you shall go out from the city and dwell in the open country; you shall go to Babylon. There you shall be rescued; there the LORD will redeem you from the hand of your enemies. Now many nations are assembled against you, saying, Let her be defiled, and let our eyes gaze upon Zion. But they do not know the thoughts of the LORD; they do not understand his plan, that he has gathered them as sheaves to the threshing floor. Arise and thresh, O daughter of Zion, for I will make your horn iron, and I will make your hoofs bronze; you shall beat in pieces many peoples; and shall devote their gain to the LORD, their wealth to the Lord of the whole earth.

  *I Corinthians 10:14-31* - Therefore, my beloved, flee from idolatry. I speak as to sensible people; judge for yourselves what I say. The cup of blessing that we bless, is it not a participation in the blood of Christ? The bread that we break, is it not a participation in the body of Christ? Because there is one bread, we who are many are one body, for we all partake of the one bread. Consider the people of Israel: are not those who eat the sacrifices participants in the altar? What do I imply then? That food offered to idols is anything, or that an idol is anything? No, I imply that what pagans sacrifice they offer to demons and not to God. I do not want you to be participants with demons. *You cannot drink the cup of the Lord and the cup of demons. You cannot partake of the table of the Lord and the table of demons*. Shall we provoke the Lord to jealousy? Are we stronger than he? All things are lawful, but not all things are helpful. All things are lawful, but not all things build up. Let no one seek his own good, but the good of his neighbor. Eat whatever is sold in the meat market without raising any question on the ground of conscience. For the earth is the Lord's, and the fullness thereof. If one of the unbelievers invites you to dinner and you are disposed to go, eat whatever is set before you without raising any question on the ground of conscience. But if someone says to you, This has been offered in sacrifice, then do not eat it, for the sake of the one who informed you, and for the sake of conscience— I do not mean your conscience, but his. For why should my liberty be determined by someone else's conscience? If I partake with thankfulness, why am I denounced because of that for which I give thanks? So, whether you eat or drink, or whatever you do, do all to the glory of God.

So they are no longer two but one flesh. What therefore God has joined together, let not man separate. They said to him, Why then did Moses command one to give a certificate of divorce and to send her away?

Marriage itself is good. So denying it for reasons of self-made religion / worldly precepts actually causes harm because it's not the truth.

Demon spirits deny relationships, whether it's a spirit of wordliness, spirit-spouse or antichrist (because it's against what Jesus taught) then that creates problems.

For example:
- worldly spirit through a person telling me I need to be financially successful first, or
- a spirit of slander or gossip which keeps me isolated, or a rejection-spirit spreading gossip/slander among people around me, creating social anxiety, making it hard to socialise with people who would be good to talk to, or
- a spirit spouse which thinks it's my spouse
- literally satan denying marriage - if I'm not allowed to marry the person I love because all of the above spirits start manifesting

As far as forsaking God's precepts for worldly precepts go, the truth is that while in God's favour, God provides, and we cooperate with God by working, etc. But if God doesn't want you to get a job at a particular time, you wont get a job, etc.

The Bible doesn't say that marriage among consenting adults with large age gap is immoral or forbidden, as far as I understand, although I need to do a more comprehensive Bible study and perhaps pray about it. But thus far I haven't found anything and God hasn't said anything against it to me as far as I know. Gay marriage, however, is not blessed at all.

While I agree that lust, and impure motivations disqualify a relationship being seen as Biblically acceptable, there are certain things I think
are not intrinsically wrong, such as marriage between consenting adults with an age gap.

Worldly people will always discriminate against people who desire to live according to the Bible:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *II Timothy 3:12-13* - Indeed, all who desire to live a godly life in Christ Jesus will be persecuted, while evil people and impostors will go on from bad to worse, deceiving and being deceived. (ESV)

And worldly people will endorse worldly things like:
- having promiscuous relationships, messing around with age-gaps, and out-of-marriage relationships saying it's ok because it's not a serious relationship, and
- endorsing gay marriage, etc. or whatever they can imagine

while worldly people will discriminate against:
- age-gap marriage between consenting adults
- people who are actually obeying God

I have a very similar option to John Piper on this I think:
- [[https://www.desiringgod.org/interviews/can-i-marry-a-woman-half-my-age][Can I Marry a Woman Half My Age? | Desiring God]]

Or have you not read in the Law how on the Sabbath the priests in the temple profane the Sabbath and are guiltless? I tell you, something greater than the temple is here. And *if you had known what this means, I desire mercy, and not sacrifice, you would not have condemned the guiltless.* For the Son of Man is lord of the Sabbath.

Statistics alone are not good enough to condemn someone from doing wrong - we need real anecdotal evidence or it's not even grounded in reality - the accusations are just slanderous fiction.

Also, I stress this verse again because if you're obeying God then the Mosaic law isn't meant for others to use it against you to condemn you. Literally, if your heart's in the right place, and you're being obedient to Jesus Christ then it's wrong for people to slap you with the Mosaic law:

Not that I was or am perfect.

*** My own experience being persecuted with relationships
Abraham was 10 years older than Sarah, but as an adult in my 30s I've received so much persecution against Christians over this, and even my own parents have a 10 year age gap. Nevertheless, I believe undoubtably that satan would rather have me marry a vacuum cleaner or an animal or accept his kundalini spirit or a spirit spouse before letting me marry somebody.

But I'm working on being delivered from demons which have been attacking me after making a marriage proposal.
I will continue following Jesus. And there's demons I'm fighting against for the last year and a half which lie daily to me, and speak blasphemies and falsehood, and attacking me in my sleep - they're pretty disgusting.

I find deliverance prayers on YouTube such as this to be quite helpful:
- [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ncXu2NpgtAw][DELIVERANCE PRAYER AGAINST DELAYS AND SETBACKS - YouTube]]

The demons which have come against me in the last year and a half are just horrendous. My entire situation is awful, and I pray to be raptured every day from this evil world that I live in currently.

In Jesus Christ's name I will be delivered from this, and I will not allow satan to steal from me any more. Jesus Christ is my defense.

In the same way husbands should love their wives as their own bodies. He who loves his wife loves himself. For no one ever hated his own flesh, but nourishes and cherishes it, just as Christ does the church, because we are members of his body. Therefore a man shall leave his father and mother and hold fast to his wife, and the two shall become one flesh. This mystery is profound, and I am saying that it refers to Christ and the church.

At midnight I rise to praise you, because of your righteous rules. I am a companion of all who fear you, of those who keep your precepts. The earth, O LORD, is full of your steadfast love; teach me your statutes! You have dealt well with your servant, O LORD, according to your word. Teth Teach me good judgment and knowledge, for I believe in your commandments. Before I was afflicted I went astray, but now I keep your word. You are good and do good; teach me your statutes. The insolent smear me with lies, but with my whole heart I keep your precepts; their heart is unfeeling like fat, but I delight in your law.

I know, O LORD, that your rules are righteous, and that in faithfulness you have afflicted me. Let your steadfast love comfort me according to your promise to your servant. Let your mercy come to me, that I may live; for your law is my delight. Let the insolent be put to shame, because they have wronged me with falsehood; as for me, I will meditate on your precepts. Let those who fear you turn to me, that they may know your testimonies. May my heart be blameless in your statutes, that I may not be put to shame!

Believing is just the starting point. This is honestly just the starting point. Obedience is *expected*. Also, Jesus is forgiving, unlike the angel.

Continuing to trust in Jesus as the Messiah, your Saviour, and the Only-begotten Son of God through patient endurance is enough to get saved, I think, but it's not enough to be counted a 'disciple' of Jesus.

And it's 'saved' but 'being saved' at the same time.

One wants to progress from 'believing that' to having Jesus abide inside them.

I think that rejects His commandments but claiming to believe in Jesus Christ as the Son of God is an extremely precarious, and tentative position to be in,
and may indicate that the person doesn't *really* believe.

And if a person doesn't believe in reality, then that person probably isn't saved - so they are only lying to themself that they are saved.

*However*, if a person trusts him who justifies the ungodly, his faith is counted as righteousness.

Trusting Him means having faith in Him, obeying. Ungodly here means wicked.

Again I tell you, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich person to enter the kingdom of God. When the disciples heard this, they were greatly astonished, saying, Who then can be saved? But Jesus looked at them and said, With man this is impossible, but with God all things are possible. Then Peter said in reply, See, we have left everything and followed you. What then will we have? Jesus said to them, Truly, I say to you, in the new world, when the Son of Man will sit on his glorious throne, you who have followed me will also sit on twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel. And everyone who has left houses or brothers or sisters or father or mother or children or lands, for my name's sake, will receive a hundredfold and will inherit eternal life. But many who are first will be last, and the last first.

But if some of the branches were broken off, and you, although a wild olive shoot, were grafted in among the others and now share in the nourishing root of the olive tree, do not be arrogant toward the branches. If you are, remember it is not you who support the root, but the root that supports you. Then you will say, Branches were broken off so that I might be grafted in. That is true. They were broken off because of their unbelief, but you stand fast through faith. So do not become proud, but stand in awe. For if God did not spare the natural branches, neither will he spare you. Note then the kindness and the severity of God: severity toward those who have fallen, but God's kindness to you, provided you continue in his kindness. Otherwise you too will be cut off. And even they, if they do not continue in their unbelief, will be grafted in, for God has the power to graft them in again. For if you were cut from what is by nature a wild olive tree, and grafted, contrary to nature, into a cultivated olive tree, how much more will these, the natural branches, be grafted back into their own olive tree. Lest you be wise in your own conceits, I want you to understand this mystery, brothers: a partial hardening has come upon Israel, until the fullness of the Gentiles has come in. And in this way all Israel will be saved, as it is written, The Deliverer will come from Zion, he will banish ungodliness from Jacob; and this will be my covenant with them when I take away their sins. As regards the gospel, they are enemies of God for your sake. But as regards election, they are beloved for the sake of their forefathers. For the gifts and the calling of God are irrevocable. Just _as you were at one time disobedient to God_ but now have received mercy because of their disobedience, so they too have now been disobedient in order that by the mercy shown to you they also may now receive mercy. For _God has consigned all to disobedience, that he may have mercy on all._

Whoever practices righteousness is righteous, as he is righteous. Whoever makes a practice of sinning is of the devil, for the devil has been sinning from the beginning. The reason the Son of God appeared was to destroy the works of the devil. No one born of God makes a practice of sinning, for God's seed abides in him, and he cannot keep on sinning because he has been born of God. By this it is evident who are the children of God, and who are the children of the devil: whoever does not practice righteousness is not of God, nor is the one who does not love his brother. For this is the message that you have heard from the beginning, that we should love one another.

Consider him who endured from sinners such hostility against himself, so that you may not grow weary or fainthearted. In your struggle against sin you have _not yet resisted to the point of shedding your blood_. And have you forgotten the exhortation that addresses you as sons? My son, do not regard lightly the discipline of the Lord, nor be weary when reproved by him. For the Lord disciplines the one he loves, and chastises every son whom he receives. It is for discipline that you have to endure. God is treating you as sons. For what son is there whom his father does not discipline? *If you are left without discipline, in which all have participated, then you are illegitimate children and not sons*. Besides this, we have had earthly fathers who disciplined us and we respected them. Shall we not much more be subject to the Father of spirits and live? For they disciplined us for a short time as it seemed best to them, but he disciplines us for our good, that we may *share his holiness*. For the moment all discipline seems painful rather than pleasant, but later it yields the peaceful *fruit of righteousness* to those who have been trained by it.

Therefore, if anyone cleanses himself from what is dishonorable, he will be a vessel for honorable use, set apart as holy, useful to the master of the house, ready for every good work.

In the same way, let your light shine before others, so that they may see your good works and give glory to your Father who is in heaven. Do not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them. For truly, I say to you, until heaven and earth pass away, not an iota, not a dot, will pass from the Law until all is accomplished. Therefore whoever relaxes one of the least of these commandments and teaches others to do the same will be called least in the kingdom of heaven, but whoever does them and teaches them will be called great in the kingdom of heaven.

for our sin.

Imputed righteousness is important, but we need also personal holiness.

I believe one must know that God's law is right:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *Romans 7:9-16* - I was once alive apart from the law, but when the commandment came, sin came alive and I died. The very commandment that promised life proved to be death to me. For sin, seizing an opportunity through the commandment, deceived me and through it killed me. So the law is holy, and the commandment is holy and righteous and good. Did that which is good, then, bring death to me? By no means! It was sin, producing death in me through what is good, in order that sin might be shown to be sin, and through the commandment might become sinful beyond measure. For we know that the law is spiritual, but I am of the flesh, sold under sin. I do not understand my own actions. For I do not do what I want, but I do the very thing I hate. Now if I do what I do not want, I agree with the law, that it is good. (ESV)

When presented with God's law, we should

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *Romans 7:6-7* - But now we are released from the law, having died to that which held us captive, so that we serve not under the old written code but in the new life of the Spirit.

I would not have known what it is to covet if the law had not said, You shall not covet. (ESV)
#+END_QUOTE

We believe in Christ Jesus in order to be justified by faith in Christ:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *Galatians 2:16* - yet we know that a person is not justified by works of the law but through faith in Jesus Christ, so we also have believed in Christ Jesus, in order to be justified by faith in Christ and not by works of the law, because by works of the law no one will be justified. (ESV)
#+END_QUOTE

So we're not trying to come under the 613 commandments of the Mosaic law,
but the precepts such as "do not covet", and "do not commit idolatry", easily seen
within the 10 commandments still describe how we should behave.

But we also don't teach people that the 613 commandments of the Mosaic law are annulled. They're not annulled. We're just not under them, because we're under the law of Christ instead:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *Matthew 5:17-18* - Do not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them. For truly, I say to you, until heaven and earth pass away, not an iota, not a dot, will pass from the Law until all is accomplished. (ESV)

So they are no longer two but one flesh. What therefore God has joined together, let not man separate.  They said to him, Why then did Moses command one to give a certificate of divorce and to send her away?  He said to them, Because of your hardness of heart Moses allowed you to divorce your wives, but *from the beginning it was not so*.  And I say to you: whoever divorces his wife, except for sexual immorality, and marries another, commits adultery.  The disciples said to him, If such is the case of a man with his wife, it is better not to marry.  But he said to them, Not everyone can receive this saying, but only those to whom it is given.  For there are eunuchs who have been so from birth, and there are eunuchs who have been made eunuchs by men, and there are eunuchs who have made themselves eunuchs for the sake of the kingdom of heaven.

Do not lie to one another, seeing that you have put off the old self with its practices
#+END_QUOTE

Lots of people say these days that trying to follow the law is self-righteousness and I don't really agree with that because to follow the law in faith is OK.
But to be 'under' the law is put oneself under a curse.

** Celebrating/endorsing sin / error is not right

If a newly born-again Christian is spending all their time with sinners though and endorsing continually instead of being discipled, then they can
have their mind conformed to the sinners instead of being strengthened in the truth. This is why I think it's not especially great to, immediately after getting born-again,
be overly exposed to unbelievers and sinners.

Jesus ate with sinners but Jesus was the special guest. Think of Nicodemus inviting Jesus over.

But at the end of the day, justification by faith in Jesus justifies the ungodly sinner - but it is faith that God justifies and not faithlessness. It's the type of belief that recognises one's sin, and results in love for Jesus, and it's obedient and submissive to God - it's repentant.

  - Often makes the mistake of being without mercy, or love.
- The humble way, with faith
  - Is accountable to God - it's not lying to God.

We all fall short of the glory of God and require the God's righteousness imputed to us through faith in Jesus, but having the righteousness of God through faith in Jesus is not license to sin.

Jesus Christ is the end of the law to all who believe, but grace isn't an excuse to sin.

God's commandments (especially the 10 Commandments; loving God and your neighbour) are still binding on us - written on our heart when we get born-again.

Right after I got [[https://web.archive.org/web/20220402091720/https://mullikine.github.io/posts/astral-projection/][born-again]] I wrote about the [[https://web.archive.org/web/20220703044748/https://mullikine.github.io/posts/the-tapestry-of-truth/][10 commandments being written on my heart]], and I believe it was the [[https://web.archive.org/web/20220503030344/https://mullikine.github.io/posts/astral-projection-pt-2/][Holy Spirit inspiring me]].

** Justification by faith - Jews + Gentiles, and in-between
There is only the one gospel message: the same gospel that Paul, Jesus, Peter and John preached.

Paul preached the same gospel as Jesus before
His crucifixion, and the same gospel that
Peter and John preached, but some people think
Paul's gospel is different - but that is
because they have been deceived by the two-gospel heresy:

To be justified, a person must _walk in the footsteps of the faith that our father Abraham had before he was circumcised_, I believe with having faith in Jesus Christ:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *Romans 4:9-12* - Is this blessing then only for the circumcised, or also for the uncircumcised? We say that faith was counted to Abraham as righteousness. How then was it counted to him? Was it before or after he had been circumcised? It was not after, but before he was circumcised. He received the sign of circumcision as a seal of the righteousness that he had by faith while he was still uncircumcised. The purpose was to make him the father of all who believe without being circumcised, so that righteousness would be counted to them as well, and to make him the father of the circumcised who are _not merely circumcised but who also walk in the footsteps of the faith that our father Abraham had before he was circumcised_.

How do we become sons of Abraham:
- [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2xzr8ZJpn8][How Do Gentiles Become Sons of Abraham? Galatians 3:6a??9, Part 3 - YouTube]]

I do believe that trusting inevitably bears fruit. Also Abraham obeyed God's commandments - that's all tied up inside the faith which Abraham had towards God.
We must have faith in God, too, but with respect to having faith in Jesus Christ, following Jesus Christ.

It is because of what Jesus Christ has accomplished through His obedience to God, His death and resurrection, that having faith in Him is effective.
Everyone *in Christ* has Him as their High Priest.

We must be a *child of Abraham.* The blessing comes through being counted as sons of Abraham.

One of the blessings is that we are counted as righteous before God, because we have faith in Jesus, loving Jesus.

Another promise is that we would be an heir of the world. We belong to the Messiah. In the Messiah, God can make promises such as this to His chosen people:

  *Romans 4:13* - For the promise to Abraham and his offspring that he would be heir of the world did not come through the law but through the righteousness of faith. (ESV)

Every valley shall be filled, and every mountain and hill shall be made low, and the crooked shall become straight, and the rough places shall become level ways, and all flesh shall see the salvation of God. He said therefore to the crowds that came out to be baptized by him, You brood of vipers! Who warned you to flee from the wrath to come? _Bear fruits in keeping with repentance_. And do not begin to say to yourselves, We have Abraham as our father. For I tell you, _God is able from these stones to raise up children for Abraham._

Tax collectors also came to be baptized and said to him, Teacher, what shall we do? And he said to them, Collect no more than you are authorized to do. Soldiers also asked him, And we, what shall we do? And he said to them, Do not extort money from anyone by threats or by false accusation, and be content with your wages. As the people were in expectation, and all were questioning in their hearts concerning John, whether he might be the Christ,

Justification by faith is the correct teaching but the promise is for the gentiles AND the adherent of the law but they all must have faith, and pursuing the law as if by works is the problem, but pursuing the law by faith is ok.

It's possible for Gentiles to keep Jewish commandments if they want (I think it's honorable) - but we are justified by faith in Jesus, not by being under the law:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *Romans 2:25-29* - For circumcision indeed is of value if you obey the law, but if you break the law, your circumcision becomes uncircumcision. So, if a man who is uncircumcised keeps _the precepts of the law_, will not his uncircumcision be regarded as circumcision? Then he who is physically uncircumcised but keeps the law will condemn you who have the written code and circumcision but break the law. For no one is a Jew who is merely one outwardly, nor is circumcision outward and physical. But _a Jew is one inwardly, and circumcision is a matter of the heart, by the Spirit, not by the letter._ His praise is not from man but from God.
#+END_QUOTE

It's possible to keep commandments by faith:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *Romans 9:30-32* - What shall we say, then? That Gentiles who did not pursue righteousness have attained it, that is, a righteousness that is by faith; but that Israel who pursued a law that would lead to righteousness did not succeed in reaching that law. Why? Because they did not pursue it by faith, but as if it were based on works. They have stumbled over the stumbling stone, (ESV)
#+END_QUOTE

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *Romans 4:15-16* - For the law brings wrath, but where there is no law there is no transgression. That is why it depends on faith, in order that the promise may rest on grace and be guaranteed to all his offspring-not only to the adherent of the law but also to the one who shares the faith of Abraham, who is the father of us all, (ESV)
#+END_QUOTE

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *Matthew 5:17-25* - Do not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them. For truly, I say to you, until heaven and earth pass away, not an iota, not a dot, will pass from the Law until all is accomplished. Therefore whoever relaxes one of the least of these commandments and teaches others to do the same will be called least in the kingdom of heaven, but whoever does them and teaches them will be called great in the kingdom of heaven. For I tell you, unless your righteousness exceeds that of the scribes and Pharisees, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven. You have heard that it was said to those of old, You shall not murder; and whoever murders will be liable to judgment. But I say to you that everyone who is angry with his brother will be liable to judgment; whoever insults his brother will be liable to the council; and whoever says, You fool! will be liable to the hell of fire. So if you are offering your gift at the altar and there remember that your brother has something against you, leave your gift there before the altar and go. First be reconciled to your brother, and then come and offer your gift. Come to terms quickly with your accuser while you are going with him to court, lest your accuser hand you over to the judge, and the judge to the guard, and you be put in prison. (ESV)

There is only one who is good. If you would enter life, keep the commandments. He said to him, Which ones? And Jesus said, You shall not murder, You shall not commit adultery, You shall not steal, You shall not bear false witness, Honor your father and mother, and, You shall love your neighbor as yourself. The young man said to him, All these I have kept. What do I still lack? Jesus said to him, If you would be perfect, go, sell what you possess and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; and come, follow me. When the young man heard this he went away sorrowful, for he had great possessions. And Jesus said to his disciples, Truly, I say to you, only with difficulty will a rich person enter the kingdom of heaven. Again I tell you, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich person to enter the kingdom of God. When the disciples heard this, they were greatly astonished, saying, Who then can be saved? But Jesus looked at them and said, With man this is impossible, but with God all things are possible.

I was born-again on 2 April 2022. On 1 April 2022 (one day before) I was wearing a pendant which on one side I had written 1023 which is decimal for the binary 1111111111 - which are ten ones. I was trying hard to follow the ten commandments *from the heart*, like Jesus teaches. I was doing this to seek Jesus. Then I was born-again. What a mystery.

Since then I've been trying to follow Jesus' commandments to get to know Him out of love for God, and because He has commanded His disciples to be fruitful for Him, and to abide in Him.

For if the sprinkling of defiled persons with the blood of goats and bulls and with the ashes of a heifer sanctifies for the purification of the flesh, how much more will the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself without blemish to God, purify our conscience from dead works to serve the living God.

** Justified by God through faith [and works done in faith?]
All of these, for example,  I believe belong under the umbrella of faith, not works:

- Getting baptised is not 'dead works'. It's obedience.
- Obeying Jesus Christ's commandments are not 'dead works'. It's obedience.

God will be the judge of who has had faith in Jesus, and who has obeyed Him.

But repentance is a work of the heart which is an act of faith.
I believe repentance is inseparable from faith because intrinsic to faith is belief and intrinsic to belief is metanoia (changing one's mind).

At it's most basic form repentance means a
person believes in Jesus as the Son of God and the Messiah who, being innocent, paid the
price for their sin through His broken body
and shed blood on the cross - a perfect and
eternal offering; that He died there but God
resurrected Him, and He is Lord of Heaven and
Earth, and has a _heart of obedience_ to the will of God,
_wanting_ to do the will of God, which involves their sanctification.
We must honour Jesus.

But I believe we are forgiven to forgive others. That must be part of the act of faith and the change of heart, I think.

  *James 2:10* - For whoever keeps the whole law but fails in one point has become accountable for all of it. For he who said, Do not commit adultery, also said, Do not murder. If you do not commit adultery but do murder, you have become a transgressor of the law. So speak and so act as those who are to be judged under the law of liberty. For judgment is without mercy to one who has shown no mercy. Mercy triumphs over judgment. What good is it, my brothers, if someone says he has faith but does not have works? Can that faith save him? If a brother or sister is poorly clothed and lacking in daily food, and one of you says to them, Go in peace, be warmed and filled, without giving them the things needed for the body, what good is that? So also faith by itself, if it does not have works, is dead. But someone will say, You have faith and I have works. Show me your faith apart from your works, and I will show you my faith by my works. You believe that God is one; you do well. Even the demons believe-and shudder! Do you want to be shown, you foolish person, that faith apart from works is useless? Was not Abraham our father justified by works when he offered up his son Isaac on the altar? You see that faith was active along with his works, and faith was completed by his works; and the Scripture was fulfilled that says, Abraham believed God, and it was counted to him as righteousness-and he was called a friend of God. You see that a person is justified by works and not by faith alone.
#+END_QUOTE

I tend to agree with James on this.
Eliminating works from faith is not good.

Works:
- obedience
- faithfulness
  - keeping God's commandments
- trust
- fear of God
- response of love
  - thankfulness
  - praise
  - forgiving others
- humility
  - keeping God's commandments
- patient endurance (time)

If a person believes that Jesus Christ is the Son of the Living God then they abide in Christ.
But do they *really* believe? Because if they don't *really* believe it deep down then but are lying to themself they may not abide in Christ at all.
How can a person believe without having a relationship with God? A relationship involves more than belief.

If a person does not have obedience, trust and
repentance from sin, but their faith has belief, then they only
abide in Jesus extremely precariously, and also that person's 'faith' probably wont receive much at all from God.

  Obedience = Submitting to the Righteousness of God * Turning from sin, loving, showing mercy, etc.

Justified through (G1223 dia) faith (G4102 *pistis*) in Christ (G5547 Christos) Jesus (G2424 Iesous).
Pistis is a strong word for faith that doesn't merely encapsulate belief, but it includes trust.

The greeks can turn the noun faith into the verb believing faith (G4100 pisteuo).
It's not the noun 'believe' as the root of the verb faith

/*we have believed (G4100 pisteuo) in Christ*/ means we have /*'faithed'*/ in Christ.

The 'believing faith' verb pisteuo has a root of faith (pistis).

Faith is a relationship with God.

His divine power has granted to us all things that pertain to life and godliness, through the knowledge of him who called us to his own glory and excellence, by which he has granted to us his precious and very great promises, so that through them you may become partakers of the divine nature, having escaped from the corruption that is in the world because of sinful desire.  For this very reason, make every effort to *supplement your faith with virtue, and virtue with knowledge, and knowledge* with self-control, and self-control with steadfastness, and steadfastness with godliness, and godliness with brotherly affection, and brotherly affection with love.  For if these qualities are yours and are increasing, they keep you from being ineffective or unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ.  For whoever lacks these qualities is so nearsighted that he is blind, having forgotten that he was cleansed from his former sins.  Therefore, brothers, be all the more diligent to make your calling and election sure, for if you practice these qualities you will never fall.

** I repent from being liberal and ever endorsing LGBT or idolatry
At first, to not judge that others wear
clothes of the opposite sex seemed mostly

sinful, erroneous things, or annulling laws
is not helpful in liberating people from sin.

*** Endorsing sinful things endorses people to become enslaved by sin / stuck in falsehood
Also, I feel as though endorsing it is in a
way similar to endorsing that people commit
adultery, in that it gets people stuck in sin,
even without the awareness they are in sin,
and makes it harder for people to find God.

I feel like getting a person unstuck from sin
is a bit like freeing an animal in that they
are often not aware that they need freeing.

Also, I believe that endorsing sinful behavior

It's totally worth following Jesus, doing good and proclaiming the gospel after getting born-again - following Jesus, even faithfully stopping sin, is the correct response,
for if being born-again is dying with Christ, and being given life by the life giving Spirit of Jesus,
we are partaking in the death and resurrection of Jesus, where Jesus had actually suffered for sins, the righteous for the unrighteous, so we too should continue living in a way that is turning away from sin.

And Jesus said, You shall not murder, You shall not commit adultery, You shall not steal, You shall not bear false witness, Honor your father and mother, and, You shall love your neighbor as yourself. The young man said to him, All these I have kept. What do I still lack? Jesus said to him, If you would be perfect, go, sell what you possess and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; and come, follow me. When the young man heard this he went away sorrowful, for he had great possessions. And Jesus said to his disciples, Truly, I say to you, only with difficulty will a rich person enter the kingdom of heaven. Again I tell you, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich person to enter the kingdom of God. When the disciples heard this, they were greatly astonished, saying, Who then can be saved? But Jesus looked at them and said, With man this is impossible, but with God all things are possible.

And the LORD said to me, They are right in what they have spoken. I will raise up for them a prophet like you from among their brothers. And I will put my words in his mouth, and he shall speak to them all that I command him. And whoever will not listen to my words that he shall speak in my name, I myself will require it of him. (ESV)
#+END_QUOTE

Walk in the truth, love one another and do not deny that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *II John 1:4-9* - I rejoiced greatly to find some of your children walking in the truth, just as we were commanded by the Father. And now I ask you, dear lady—not as though I were writing you a new commandment, but the one we have had from the beginning—that we love one another. And *this is love*, _that we walk according to his commandments_; this is the commandment, just as you have heard from the beginning, so that you should walk in it. For many deceivers have gone out into the world, those who do not confess the coming of Jesus Christ in the flesh. Such a one is the deceiver and the antichrist. Watch yourselves, so that you may not lose what we have worked for, but may win a full reward. Everyone who goes on ahead and does not abide in the teaching of Christ, does not have God. Whoever abides in the teaching has both the Father and the Son. (ESV)

#+END_QUOTE

Love your enemies as well as your friends. Be like Your Heavenly Father. Be perfect:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *Matthew 5:43-48* - You have heard that it was said, You shall love your neighbor and hate your enemy. But I say to you, Love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you, so that you may be sons of your Father who is in heaven. For he makes his sun rise on the evil and on the good, and sends rain on the just and on the unjust. For if you love those who love you, what reward do you have? Do not even the tax collectors do the same? And if you greet only your brothers, what more are you doing than others? Do not even the Gentiles do the same? You therefore must be perfect, as your heavenly Father is perfect. (ESV)

Be perfect as your heavenly Father is perfect:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *Matthew 5:48* - You therefore must be perfect, as your heavenly Father is perfect. (ESV)
#+END_QUOTE

Be accountable to God. Do not seek reward from others but from God. Focus on spiritual disciplines for the right reasons.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *Matthew 6:1-18* - Beware of practicing your righteousness before other people in order to be seen by them, for then you will have no reward from your Father who is in heaven. Thus, when you give to the needy, sound no trumpet before you, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets, that they may be praised by others. Truly, I say to you, they have received their reward. But when you give to the needy, do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing, so that your giving may be in secret. And your Father who sees in secret will reward you. And when you pray, you must not be like the hypocrites. For they love to stand and pray in the synagogues and at the street corners, that they may be seen by others. Truly, I say to you, they have received their reward. But when you pray, go into your room and shut the door and pray to your Father who is in secret. And your Father who sees in secret will reward you. And when you pray, do not heap up empty phrases as the Gentiles do, for they think that they will be heard for their many words. Do not be like them, for your Father knows what you need before you ask him. Pray then like this: Our Father in heaven, hallowed be your name. Your kingdom come, your will be done, on earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread, and forgive us our debts, as we also have forgiven our debtors. And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. For if you forgive others their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you, but if you do not forgive others their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses. And when you fast, do not look gloomy like the hypocrites, for they disfigure their faces that their fasting may be seen by others. Truly, I say to you, they have received their reward. But when you fast, anoint your head and wash your face, that your fasting may not be seen by others but by your Father who is in secret. And your Father who sees in secret will reward you. (ESV)
#+END_QUOTE

Have a relationship with God:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *Hebrews 11:6* - And without faith it is impossible to please him, for whoever would draw near to God must believe that he exists and that he rewards those who seek him. (ESV)
#+END_QUOTE

Seek heavenly reward, not earthly reward. Have a heart seeking reward from God and not from man. Have your heart in heaven, not in earth:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *Matthew 6:19-21* - Do not lay up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moth and rust destroy and where thieves break in and steal, but lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust destroys and where thieves do not break in and steal. For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also. (ESV)
#+END_QUOTE

Seek God's kingdom and His righteousness first of all:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *Matthew 6:33* - But seek first the kingdom of God and his righteousness, and all these things will be added to you. (ESV)
#+END_QUOTE

Do not worry about tomorrow:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *Matthew 6:34* - Therefore do not be anxious about tomorrow, for tomorrow will be anxious for itself. Sufficient for the day is its own trouble. (ESV)
#+END_QUOTE

Use right judgment. We should be examining, judging, cleaning ourselves up, taking a look in the mirror first (by God's standards) before judging others:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *Matthew 7:1-5* - Judge not, that you be not judged. For with the judgment you pronounce you will be judged, and with the measure you use it will be measured to you. Why do you see the speck that is in your brother's eye, but do not notice the log that is in your own eye? Or how can you say to your brother, Let me take the speck out of your eye, when there is the log in your own eye? You hypocrite, first take the log out of your own eye, and then you will see clearly to take the speck out of your brother's eye. (ESV)
#+END_QUOTE

Practice discretion:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *Matthew 7:6* - Do not give dogs what is holy, and do not throw your pearls before pigs, lest they trample them underfoot and turn to attack you. (ESV)
#+END_QUOTE

Ask, seek, and knock:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *Matthew 7:7-8* - Ask, and it will be given to you; seek, and you will find; knock, and it will be opened to you. For everyone who asks receives, and the one who seeks finds, and to the one who knocks it will be opened. (ESV)
#+END_QUOTE

Ask God for your needs, which includes asking God for *the Holy Spirit*:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *Luke 11:1-11* - Now Jesus was praying in a certain place, and when he finished, one of his disciples said to him, Lord, teach us to pray, as John taught his disciples. And he said to them, When you pray, say: Father, hallowed be your name. Your kingdom come. Give us each day our daily bread, and forgive us our sins, for we ourselves forgive everyone who is indebted to us. And lead us not into temptation. And he said to them, Which of you who has a friend will go to him at midnight and say to him, Friend, lend me three loaves, for a friend of mine has arrived on a journey, and I have nothing to set before him; and he will answer from within, Do not bother me; the door is now shut, and my children are with me in bed. I cannot get up and give you anything? I tell you, though he will not get up and give him anything because he is his friend, yet because of his impudence he will rise and give him whatever he needs. And I tell you, ask, and it will be given to you; *seek, and you will find*; knock, and it will be opened to you. For *everyone who asks receives*, and *the one who seeks finds*, and to *the one who knocks it will be opened*. What father among you, if his son asks for a fish, will instead of a fish give him a serpent; (ESV)
#+END_QUOTE

Treat others as you would like to be treated:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *Matthew 7:12* - So whatever you wish that others would do to you, do also to them, for this is the Law and the Prophets. (ESV)
#+END_QUOTE

Choose the narrow path to life:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *Matthew 7:13-14* - Enter by the narrow gate. For the gate is wide and the way is easy that leads to destruction, and those who enter by it are many. For the gate is narrow and the way is hard that leads to life, and those who find it are few. (ESV)
#+END_QUOTE

Look out for false prophets:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *Matthew 7:15-20* - Beware of false prophets, who come to you in sheep's clothing but inwardly are ravenous wolves. You will recognize them by their fruits. Are grapes gathered from thornbushes, or figs from thistles? So, every healthy tree bears good fruit, but the diseased tree bears bad fruit. A healthy tree cannot bear bad fruit, nor can a diseased tree bear good fruit. Every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire. Thus you will recognize them by their fruits. (ESV)
#+END_QUOTE

Pray for kingdom laborers. Pray that God sends out kingdom laborers:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *Matthew 9:37-38* - Then he said to his disciples, The harvest is plentiful, but the laborers are few; therefore pray earnestly to the Lord of the harvest to send out laborers into his harvest. (ESV)
#+END_QUOTE

Be on your guard. Jesus sends us out to be like scapegoats. Be wise and remain blameless:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *Matthew 10:16-17* - Behold, I am sending you out as *sheep in the midst of wolves*, so be wise as serpents and *innocent as doves*. Beware of men, for they will deliver you over to courts and flog you in their synagogues, (ESV)
#+END_QUOTE

Do not fear persecutors. Fear God. But put your trust in God because He takes care of those who fear Him. Speak the truth:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *Matthew 10:26-31* - So have no fear of them, for nothing is covered that will not be revealed, or hidden that will not be known. What I tell you in the dark, say in the light, and what you hear whispered, proclaim on the housetops. And do not fear those who kill the body but cannot kill the soul. Rather fear him who can destroy both soul and body in hell. Are not two sparrows sold for a penny? And not one of them will fall to the ground apart from your Father. But even the hairs of your head are all numbered. Fear not, therefore; you are of more value than many sparrows. (ESV)
#+END_QUOTE

Take Jesus' yoke upon yourself:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *Matthew 11:28-30* - Come to me, all who labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you, and learn from me, for I am gentle and lowly in heart, and you will find rest for your souls. For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light. (ESV)
#+END_QUOTE

Do not despise the little ones:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *Matthew 18:10* - See that you do not despise one of these little ones. For I tell you that in heaven their angels always see the face of my Father who is in heaven. (ESV)
#+END_QUOTE

How to deal with offenders:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *Matthew 18:15-17* - If your brother sins against you, go and tell him his fault, between you and him alone. If he listens to you, you have gained your brother. But if he does not listen, take one or two others along with you, that every charge may be established by the evidence of two or three witnesses. If he refuses to listen to them, tell it to the church. And if he refuses to listen even to the church, let him be to you as a Gentile and a tax collector. (ESV)
#+END_QUOTE

Forgive extremely generously / almost without limits:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *Matthew 18:21-22* - Then Peter came up and said to him, Lord, how often will my brother sin against me, and I forgive him? As many as seven times? Jesus said to him, I do not say to you seven times, but seventy times seven. (ESV)
#+END_QUOTE

Lead through service:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *Matthew 20:25-28* - But Jesus called them to him and said, You know that the rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them, and their great ones exercise authority over them. It shall not be so among you. But whoever would be great among you must be your servant, and whoever would be first among you must be your slave, even as the Son of Man came not to be served but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many. (ESV)
#+END_QUOTE

Love God with all your heart, mind, and soul:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *Matthew 22:37-38* - And he said to him, You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind. This is the great and first commandment. (ESV)

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *Matthew 22:39* - And a second is like it: You shall love your neighbor as yourself. (ESV)
#+END_QUOTE

Stay alert and keep watch:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *Matthew 24:42-44* - Therefore, stay awake, for you do not know on what day your Lord is coming. But know this, that if the master of the house had known in what part of the night the thief was coming, he would have stayed awake and would not have let his house be broken into. Therefore you also must be ready, for the Son of Man is coming at an hour you do not expect. (ESV)
#+END_QUOTE

Make disciples of all the nations, teaching them to obey Jesus:
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *Matthew 28:18-20* - And Jesus came and said to them, All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me. Go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of *the Holy Spirit*, teaching them to observe all that I have commanded you. And behold, I am with you always, to the end of the age. (ESV)
#+END_QUOTE

Deny yourself daily, and follow Jesus:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *Luke 9:23-24* - And he said to all, If anyone would come after me, let him deny himself and take up his cross daily and follow me. For whoever would save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for my sake will save it. (ESV)
#+END_QUOTE

Do not covet your possessions:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE

  *Luke 14:12-14* - He said also to the man who had invited him, When you give a dinner or a banquet, do not invite your friends or your brothers or your relatives or rich neighbors, lest they also invite you in return and you be repaid. But when you give a feast, invite the poor, the crippled, the lame, the blind, and you will be blessed, because they cannot repay you. You will be repaid at the resurrection of the just. (ESV)

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *John 14:21* - Whoever has my commandments and keeps them, he it is who loves me. And he who loves me will be loved by my Father, and I will love him and manifest myself to him.
#+END_QUOTE

Those who have testimony of Jesus should preach testify that he is the one appointed by God to be judge of the living and the dead:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *Acts 10:41-44* - not to all the people but to us who had been chosen by God as witnesses, who ate and drank with him after he rose from the dead. And he commanded us to preach to the people and to testify that he is the one appointed by God to be judge of the living and the dead. To him all the prophets bear witness that everyone who believes in him receives forgiveness of sins through his name. While Peter was still saying these things, *the Holy Spirit* fell on all who heard the word. (ESV)

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *Acts 13:47* - For so the Lord has commanded us, saying, I have made you a light for the Gentiles, that you may bring salvation to the ends of the earth.

** Precepts of Paul
- Pursue godliness with contentment but not without contentment. Pursue personal righteousness
  - righteousness,
  - godliness,
  - faith,
  - love,
  - steadfastness,
  - gentleness.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *I Timothy 6:3-11* - If anyone teaches a different doctrine and does not agree with _the sound words of our Lord Jesus Christ and the teaching that accords with godliness_, he is _puffed up with conceit and understands nothing._ He has an unhealthy craving for controversy and for quarrels about words, which produce envy, dissension, slander, evil suspicions, and constant friction among people who are depraved in mind and deprived of the truth, imagining that godliness is a means of gain. Now there is great gain in _godliness with contentment,_ for we brought nothing into the world, and we cannot take anything out of the world. But if we have food and clothing, with these we will be content. But _those who desire to be rich fall into temptation, into a snare, into many senseless and harmful desires that plunge people into ruin and destruction._ For the love of money is a root of all kinds of evils. It is through this craving that some have wandered away from the faith and pierced themselves with many pangs. But as for you, O man of God, _flee these things_. Pursue righteousness, godliness, faith, love, steadfastness, gentleness. (ESV)
#+END_QUOTE

* godliness
The word godliness, I think means, to _act in a way fitting of having true knowledge of our God, and of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ_, and preparing oneself for eternity.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *Titus 1:1* - Paul, a bond-servant (G1401 doulos) of God (G2316 theos) and an apostle of Jesus (G2424 Iesous) Christ (G5547 Christos), for the faith (G4102 pistis) of those chosen of God (G2316 theos) and the knowledge (G1922 epignosis) of the truth (G225 aletheia) which is according to godliness (G2150 eusebeia),
#+END_QUOTE

Perfect godliness revealing God through Jesus Christ:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *I Timothy 3:16* - Great indeed, we confess, is the mystery of godliness: He was manifested in the flesh, vindicated by the Spirit, seen by angels, proclaimed among the nations, believed on in the world, taken up in glory. (ESV)
#+END_QUOTE

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *Isaiah 32:6* - For the fool speaks folly, and his heart is busy with iniquity, to practice ungodliness, to utter error concerning the LORD, to leave the craving of the hungry unsatisfied, and to deprive the thirsty of drink. (ESV)

He received the sign of circumcision as a seal of the righteousness that he had by faith while he was still uncircumcised. The purpose was to make him the father of all who believe without being circumcised, so that righteousness would be counted to them as well, and to make him the father of the circumcised who are _not merely circumcised but who also walk in the footsteps of the faith that our father Abraham had before he was circumcised_.

As it is written, Jacob I loved, but Esau I hated. What shall we say then? Is there injustice on God's part? By no means! For he says to Moses, I will have mercy on whom I have mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I have compassion. So then it depends not on human will or exertion, but on God, who has mercy.

If God is for us, who can be against us? He who did not spare his own Son but gave him up for us all, how will he not also with him graciously give us all things? Who shall bring any charge against God's elect? It is God who justifies. Who is to condemn? Christ Jesus is the one who died—more than that, who was raised—who is at the right hand of God, who indeed is interceding for us. Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? Shall tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or danger, or sword? As it is written, For your sake we are being killed all the day long; we are regarded as sheep to be slaughtered. No, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him who loved us.

- The elect fear God
  - They had soft hearts
    - able to believe and obey
- The non-elect *judge themselves* unworthy of eternal life
  - They had hard hearts
    - unable to believe and obey

One thing is for sure. The elect do not have hard hearts.
So I'd say if a person's heart is not totally hard, then soften it.

A heart not easy to be moved with virtuous affections:
- *Deuteronomy 15:7* - If among you, one of your brothers should become poor, in any of your towns within your land that the Lord your God is giving you, you shall not harden your heart or shut your hand against your poor brother, (ESV)
- *Mark 3:4-5* - And He said to them, “Is it lawful to do good or to do harm on the Sabbath, to save a life or to kill?” But they kept silent. After looking around at them with anger, grieved at their hardness of heart, He said to the man, “Stretch out your hand.” And he stretched it out, and his hand was restored. (ESV)
- [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaMVzW9yiBc][Do I Have a Hard Heart? - YouTube]]
- *Mark 8:17* - And Jesus, aware of this, said to them, Why are you discussing the fact that you have no bread? Do you not yet perceive or understand? Are your hearts hardened? (ESV)
- *II Chronicles 36:12-13* - He did what was evil in the sight of the Lord his God. He did not humble himself before Jeremiah the prophet, who spoke from the mouth of the Lord. He also rebelled against King Nebuchadnezzar, who had made him swear by God. He stiffened his neck and hardened his heart against turning to the Lord, the God of Israel. (ESV)
- *Romans 2:4* - Or do you presume on the riches of his kindness and forbearance and patience, not knowing that God's kindness is meant to lead you to repentance? (ESV)
- *Zechariah 7:12* - They made their hearts diamond-hard lest they should hear the law and the words that the Lord of hosts had sent by his Spirit through the former prophets. Therefore great anger came from the Lord of hosts. (ESV)

If we have a hard heart, we should ask for a new one:
- *Ezekiel 36:26* - And I will give you a new heart, and a new spirit I will put within you. And I will remove the heart of stone from your flesh and give you a heart of flesh.

Don't let your heart go hard - find a community of encouraging believers:
- *Hebrews 3:13* - But exhort one another every day, as long as it is called today, that none of you may be hardened by the deceitfulness of sin.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *Acts 13:46-48* - And Paul and Barnabas spoke out boldly, saying, It was necessary that the word of God be spoken first to you.  Since you thrust it aside and *judge yourselves unworthy* of eternal life, behold, we are turning to the Gentiles.  For so the Lord has commanded us, saying, I have made you a light for the Gentiles, that you may bring salvation to the ends of the earth.  And when the Gentiles heard this, they began rejoicing and glorifying the word of the Lord, and as many as were appointed to eternal life believed. (ESV)
#+END_QUOTE

I do believe, however, that *cooperation* is generally required on the part of the believer:
- Before regeneration, and
- After regeneration

Before regeneration, I was trying hard to repent of my sin by trying to obey the 10 commandments *from the heart*.
And I would say I was also making progress.
After regeneration, I had to learn to walk in Jesus' commandments, and to submit to His righteousness.

To be sanctified by faith in Jesus is an applied process, I think:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *Acts 26:18* - to open their eyes, so that they may turn from darkness to light and from the power of Satan to God, that they may receive forgiveness of sins and a place among those who are *sanctified by faith in me*. (ESV)
#+END_QUOTE

In similar fashion to Jesus continually obeying Father God as he endured suffering, I think we should learn to submit and follow Jesus' commandments

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *Hebrews 5:7-10* - In the days of his flesh, Jesus offered up prayers and supplications, with loud cries and tears, to him who was able to save him from death, and he was heard because of his reverence. _Although he was a son, he learned obedience through what he suffered._ And being made perfect, he became the source of eternal salvation to all who obey him, being designated by God a high priest after the order of Melchizedek.
#+END_QUOTE

I believe that after being [[https://web.archive.org/web/20220402091720/https://mullikine.github.io/posts/astral-projection/][born-again of the spirit]], I had (with very little knowledge of Jesus' commandments) had to learn Jesus' commandments and apply them, and I believe *the Holy Spirit* taught me to obey Jesus as I read Jesus' sayings and was subsequently tested on those sayings. For example, if I read that we must give to all who ask, and then the Lord sets up a situation where someone asks for money, then I have a choice to obey Jesus, which means resisting those who try to deter me from obeying Jesus. Upon being tested, someone would offer worldly wisdom in an attempt to deter me from following Jesus, and as I obey God I am led by *the Holy Spirit*, and taught by *the Holy Spirit*. And this is an ongoing process. I say this for others' sake to explain how I have come to know how faith in Jesus, following Jesus, works practically, that it is more than mere intellectual belief to be led by the Spirit, but it is also obedience, and a process of sanctification, and walking in the light.

So I was born-again of the Spirit and when that happened I was given some very strong faith/knowledge that God exists, but I still had to seek Jesus because the Bible says that anyone who
claims to know Jesus but doesn't walk in His commandments is not telling the truth, and I want to come to know Jesus.

  *Luke 3:3-8* - And he went into all the region around the Jordan, proclaiming a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins. As it is written in the book of the words of Isaiah the prophet, The voice of one crying in the wilderness: Prepare the way of the Lord, make his paths straight. Every valley shall be filled, and every mountain and hill shall be made low, and the crooked shall become straight, and the rough places shall become level ways, and all flesh shall see the salvation of God. He said therefore to the crowds that came out to be baptized by him, You brood of vipers! Who warned you to flee from the wrath to come? _Bear fruits in keeping with repentance_. And do not begin to say to yourselves, We have Abraham as our father. For I tell you, _God is able from these stones to raise up children for Abraham._

That is when God _rewarded_ Abraham for Abraham's faithfulness, with a promise:

  *Genesis 15:1-6* - After these things the word of the Lord came to Abram in a vision: Fear not, Abram, I am your shield; your reward shall be very great. But Abram said, O Lord God, what will you give me, for I continue childless, and the heir of my house is Eliezer of Damascus? And Abram said, Behold, you have given me no offspring, and a member of my household will be my heir. And behold, the word of the Lord came to him: This man shall not be your heir; your very own son shall be your heir. And he brought him outside and said, Look toward heaven, and number the stars, if you are able to number them. Then he said to him, So shall your offspring be. And he believed the Lord, and he counted it to him as righteousness.

Rewards are for people who _choose_ to do the right thing.

It doesn't say, God rewarded God. God said that Abraham's reward shall be very great. God rewarded Abraham.

For what can be known about God is plain to them, because God has shown it to them. For his invisible attributes, namely, his eternal power and divine nature, have been clearly perceived, ever since the creation of the world, in the things that have been made. So they are without excuse. For although they knew God, they did not honor him as God or give thanks to him, but they became futile in their thinking, and their foolish hearts were darkened. Claiming to be wise, they became fools, and exchanged the glory of the immortal God for images resembling mortal man and birds and animals and reptiles. Therefore God gave them up in the lusts of their hearts to impurity, to the dishonoring of their bodies among themselves, because they exchanged the truth about God for a lie and worshiped and served the creature rather than the Creator, who is blessed forever!

Brothers, join in imitating me, and keep your eyes on those who walk according to the example you have in us. For many, of whom I have often told you and now tell you even with tears, walk as enemies of the cross of Christ.

  *II John 1:4-6* - I was very glad to find some of your children walking in truth, just as we have received commandment to do from the Father. And now I ask you, dear lady—not as though I were writing you a new commandment, but the one we have had from the beginning—that we love one another. And *this is love*, _that we walk according to his commandments_; this is the commandment, just as you have heard from the beginning, so that you should walk in it.

  *Matthew 1:18-25* - Now the birth of Jesus Christ took place in this way. When his mother Mary had been betrothed to Joseph, before they came together she was found to be _with child from *the Holy Spirit*._ And her husband Joseph, being a just man and unwilling to put her to shame, resolved to divorce her quietly. But as he considered these things, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream, saying, Joseph, son of David, do not fear to take Mary as your wife, for that which is conceived in her is from *the Holy Spirit*. She will bear a son, and you shall call his name Jesus, for he will save his people from their sins. All this took place to fulfill what the Lord had spoken by the prophet: Behold, the virgin shall conceive and bear a son, and _they shall call his name Immanuel (which means, God with us)_. When Joseph woke from sleep, he did as the angel of the Lord commanded him: he took his wife, but knew her not until she had given birth to a son. And he called his name Jesus. (ESV)

And you, who were dead in your trespasses and the uncircumcision of your flesh, God made alive together with him, having forgiven us all our trespasses, by canceling the record of debt that stood against us with its legal demands.

The Father is not specifically the Son (Jesus Christ), at least in title, but Jesus is the Word, and the Word is God, and I think Jesus Christ is still the Father in the sense that Jesus Christ is in the Father, and the Father in the Son, but there still seems to be some distinction there between persons or titles, and to be honest, I'm just trying to rationalise this and understand how this fits together and don't presume to know everything with certainty. And Jesus came in the Father's name. God was revealed in Jesus Christ for us.

** God adopts children, fellow heirs with Christ
The sons of God on earth who are being adopted by God:
- are led by the Spirit
  - obeying Jesus Christ
- are sons of Abraham, with the faith of Abraham
  - demonstrating the faith that Abraham had
- have had faith in Jesus Christ's name
- suffer with Christ in order to be glorified with Him
- await their adoption as sons when our bodies are redeemed
- have the creation eagerly longing for their revealing
- have heard God and had faith

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *Romans 8:14-23* - For _all who are led by the Spirit of God are sons of God._ For you did not receive the spirit of slavery to fall back into fear, but you have received the Spirit of adoption as sons, by whom we cry, Abba! Father! The Spirit himself bears witness with our spirit that we are children of God, and if children, then heirs—heirs of God and fellow heirs with Christ, _provided we suffer with him in order that we may also be glorified with him._ For I consider that the sufferings of this present time are not worth comparing with the glory that is to be revealed to us. For the creation waits with eager longing for the revealing of the sons of God. For the creation was subjected to futility, not willingly, but because of him who subjected it, in hope that the creation itself will be set free from its bondage to decay and obtain the freedom of the glory of the children of God. For we know that the whole creation has been groaning together in the pains of childbirth until now. And not only the creation, but we ourselves, who have the firstfruits of the Spirit, groan inwardly as _we wait eagerly for adoption as sons, the redemption of our bodies._ (ESV)

Receiving is a mixture of believing, obeying, trusting, believing to receive - as Abraham's faith was. The faith to receive Jesus, getting to know Him I think is a span of time (it could be instantaneous to a lengthy period of time), I presume, as a person continues to trust Him:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *Romans 4:9-12* - Is this blessing then only for the circumcised, or also for the uncircumcised? We say that faith was counted to Abraham as righteousness. How then was it counted to him? Was it before or after he had been circumcised? It was not after, but before he was circumcised. He received the sign of circumcision as a seal of the righteousness that he had by faith while he was still uncircumcised. The purpose was to make him the father of all who believe without being circumcised, so that righteousness would be counted to them as well, and to make him the father of the circumcised who are _not merely circumcised but who also walk in the footsteps of the faith that our father Abraham had before he was circumcised_.

Gathering them together, He commanded them not to leave Jerusalem, but to wait for what the Father had promised, “Which,” He said, “you heard of from Me; for John baptized with water, but you will be baptized with *the Holy Spirit* not many days from now.” So when they had come together, they were asking Him, saying, “Lord, is it at this time You are restoring the kingdom to Israel?” He said to them, “It is not for you to know times or epochs which the Father has fixed by His own authority; but you will receive power when *the Holy Spirit* has come upon you; and you shall be My witnesses both in Jerusalem, and in all Judea and Samaria, and even to the remotest part of the earth.” And after He had said these things, He was lifted up while they were looking on, and a cloud received Him out of their sight. And as they were gazing intently into the sky while He was going, behold, two men in white clothing stood beside them. They also said, “Men of Galilee, why do you stand looking into the sky? This Jesus, who has been taken up from you into heaven, will come in just the same way as you have watched Him go into heaven.” Then they returned to Jerusalem from the mount called Olivet, which is near Jerusalem, a Sabbath day’s journey away.

O righteous Father, even though the world does not know you, I know you, and these know that you have sent me.

All the times a person has acted in Christlike obedience:

- giving mercy to others in knowledge they have themselves received mercy
- encouraging one-another

God glorifies Jesus (His Son) so Jesus may glorify Him (God).
Jesus glorifies us (His disciples) so we may glorify Him (Jesus) and glorify God by glorifying Jesus.

*** The putting off of the body
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *II Peter 1:13-21* - I think it right, as long as I am in this body, to stir you up by way of reminder, since I know that the putting off of my body will be soon, as our Lord Jesus Christ made clear to me.  And I will make every effort so that after my departure you may be able at any time to recall these things.  For we did not follow cleverly devised myths when we made known to you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, but we were eyewitnesses of his majesty.  For when he received honor and glory from God the Father, and the voice was borne to him by the Majestic Glory, This is my beloved Son, with whom I am well pleased, we ourselves heard this very voice borne from heaven, for we were with him on the holy mountain.  And we have something more sure, the prophetic word, to which you will do well to pay attention as to a lamp shining in a dark place, until the day dawns and the morning star rises in your hearts, knowing this first of all, that no prophecy of Scripture comes from someone's own interpretation.  For no prophecy was ever produced by the will of man, but men spoke from God as they were carried along by *the Holy Spirit*.
#+END_QUOTE

*** I think to relax commandments is throw away glorification
#+BEGIN_QUOTE

#+END_QUOTE

However, I'm not placing myself under the Mosaic law.
My job is to do God's will, and I believe I have to maintain faithfulness to God with regards to His will for my life,
being led by *the Holy Spirit*, not making Mosaic law compliance my objective, but making God's will my objective.
So, for example, that means making disciples of Jesus.
Also, that means deepening my relationship with Jesus.

# + Total depravity (Calvinism) :: Humanity possesses "free will", but it is in bondage to sin, until it is "transformed".
# + Total depravity (Lutheranism) :: Humanity possesses free will in regard to "goods and possessions", but is sinful by nature and unable to contribute to its own salvation.
# + Total depravity (Arminianism) :: Humanity possesses freedom from necessity, but not "freedom from sin" unless enabled by "prevenient grace".

# ** My beliefs

# Not everyone is saved those who are sanctified by the Spirit through faith:

# *II Thessalonians 2:11-14* - Therefore God sends them a strong delusion, so that they may believe what is false, in order that all may be condemned who did not believe the truth but had pleasure in unrighteousness. But we ought always to give thanks to God for you, brothers beloved by the Lord, because God chose you as the firstfruits to be saved, through *sanctification by the Spirit* _and_ *belief in the truth*. To this he called you through our gospel, so that you may obtain the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ.

* Jesus Christ is fully God and fully human
Jesus Christ is the Word of God who became flesh - this is what I believe - not just God *in* the flesh but God who *became* flesh, then He was put to death on a tree (a cross) for our trespasses and Father God raised Him from the dead for our justification:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *John 1:14* - And *the Word became flesh and dwelt among us*, and we have seen his glory, glory as of the only Son from the Father, full of grace and truth. (ESV)
#+END_QUOTE

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
 *Romans 4:20-25* - No distrust made him waver concerning the promise of God, but he grew strong in his faith as he gave glory to God, fully convinced that God was able to do what he had promised. That is why his faith was counted to him as righteousness. But the words it was counted to him were not written for his sake alone, but for ours also. It will be counted to us who believe in him who raised from the dead Jesus our Lord, who was delivered up for our trespasses and raised for our justification. (ESV)
#+END_QUOTE

AMEN!!

I trust the ESV and NASB translations that say the word became flesh.

Also, I've been born of God, so I have Christ in me:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *John 1:12-13* - But to all who did receive him, who believed in his name, he gave the right to become children of God, who were born, not of blood nor of the will of the flesh nor of the will of man, but of God. (ESV)
#+END_QUOTE

I have the Spirit of God in me:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *Romans 8:9* - You, however, are not in the flesh but in the Spirit, if in fact the Spirit of God dwells in you. Anyone who does not have the Spirit of Christ does not belong to him. (ESV)

And all the angels were standing around the throne and around the elders and the four living creatures, and they fell on their faces before the throne and worshiped God, saying, Amen! Blessing and glory and wisdom and thanksgiving and honor and power and might be to our God forever and ever! Amen.  (ESV)

Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a net that was thrown into the sea and gathered fish of every kind. When it was full, men drew it ashore and sat down and sorted the good into containers but threw away the bad. So it will be at the close of the age. _The angels will come out and separate the evil from the righteous and throw them into the fiery furnace._ In that place there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth. Have you understood all these things? They said to him, Yes. And he said to them, Therefore every scribe who has been trained for the kingdom of heaven is like a master of a house, who brings out of his treasure what is new and what is old.
