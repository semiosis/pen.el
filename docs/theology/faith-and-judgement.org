This document has been a work in progress. I have been born-again and have done my own Bible study, and I'm happy with what I have written here.
I'm trying to speak the truth in mercy. This document shows my current understanding at the time of writing.

I agree whole heartedly with Keith Green here:
- [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z7oCa9BvO9g][Keith Green 1978 : Make My Life A Prayer to You {live} - YouTube]]

Almost all of verses are taken from the ESV
(English Standard Version) bible with the odd NASB
(New American Standard Bible), KJV (King
James Version), and BSB (Berean Study Bible) used here and there.

By default I will use the ESV and where it is
not from the ESV, I have almost certainly marked it with the alternative version used.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *Romans 8:1-2* - There is therefore now no condemnation for those _who are in Christ Jesus._ For the law of the Spirit of life has set you free in Christ Jesus from the law of sin and death. (ESV)
#+END_QUOTE

I consider all who are trusting in the Lord Jesus Christ, who is God, for their salvation to be _in Christ Jesus._
No matter what else I say in this document.
I have been just trying to figure out my theology. One God, three persons, Father, Son and Holy Spirit. AMEN!!

No matter what I have said. I believe that anyone who trusts in the Lord Jesus Christ, even they have no works, but only a trusting heart, believing what Jesus said, and putting their hope in Jesus, to be saved, and to be in Christ.

---

I believe that a person is justified when they trust and believe on God in their heart, believing that they need saving and that Jesus Christ is their Lord and that Jesus Christ died for their transgressions and was raised for their justification - that they have a hearing heart and a heart that follows Him.
At that stage they may have no work but I believe at that stage they are justified, when it's in their heart.
But I'm not the one to justify, God is.
And I assume that Jesus knows who those people are - He knows that they are His sheep, and that Father God draws those people to Him.

  *Isaiah 30:20-21* - And _though the Lord give you the bread of adversity and the water of affliction, yet your Teacher will not hide himself anymore_, but your eyes shall see your Teacher. And your ears shall hear a word behind you, saying, *This is the way, walk in it*, when you turn to the right or when you turn to the left.
#+END_QUOTE

I believe the above prophetically talks about Jesus. We must obey Jesus. God doesn't guarantee that following Jesus will be easy.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *John 6:44-46* - No one can come to me unless the Father who sent me draws him. And I will raise him up on the last day. It is written in the Prophets, And they will all be taught by God. Everyone who has heard and learned from the Father comes to me— not that anyone has seen the Father except he who is from God; he has seen the Father. (ESV)
#+END_QUOTE

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *II John 1:6* - And this is love, that we walk according to his commandments; this is the *commandment*, just as you have heard from the beginning, so that you should *walk in it*. (ESV)
#+END_QUOTE

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *II Peter 2:20-21* - For if, after they have escaped the defilements of the world through the knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, they are again entangled in them and overcome, the last state has become worse for them than the first. For it would have been better for them never to have known *the way of righteousness* than after knowing it to turn back from the holy commandment delivered to them.
#+END_QUOTE

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *Matthew 21:32* - For John came to you in the _way of righteousness_, and you did not believe him, but the tax collectors and the prostitutes believed him. And even when you saw it, you did not afterward change your minds and believe him.
#+END_QUOTE

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *John 14:6* - Jesus said to him, _I am the way_, and the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me.
#+END_QUOTE

* Great commission
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *Luke 24:46-47* - and said to them, Thus it is written, that the Christ should suffer and on the third day rise from the dead, and that *repentance* (G3341 metanoia) and *forgiveness* (G859 aphesis) of sins should be proclaimed in his name to all nations, beginning from Jerusalem.
#+END_QUOTE

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *Matthew 28:18-20* - And Jesus came up and spoke to them, saying, “All authority has been given to Me in heaven and on earth. Go therefore and make disciples of all the nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit, teaching them to observe *all that I commanded you*; and lo, I am with you always, even to the end of the age.”
#+END_QUOTE

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *Mark 16:15-18* - And he said to them, Go into all the world and proclaim the gospel to the whole creation. Whoever believes and is baptized will be saved, but whoever does not believe will be condemned. And these signs will accompany those who believe: in my name they will cast out demons; they will speak in new tongues; they will pick up serpents with their hands; and if they drink any deadly poison, it will not hurt them; they will lay their hands on the sick, and they will recover.
#+END_QUOTE

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *John 21:15-17* - When they had finished breakfast, Jesus said to Simon Peter, Simon, son of John, do you love me more than these? He said to him, Yes, Lord; you know that I love you. He said to him, Feed my lambs. He said to him a second time, Simon, son of John, do you love me? He said to him, Yes, Lord; you know that I love you. He said to him, Tend my sheep. He said to him the third time, Simon, son of John, do you love me? Peter was grieved because he said to him the third time, Do you love me? and he said to him, Lord, you know everything; you know that I love you. Jesus said to him, Feed my sheep.
#+END_QUOTE

The original Apostles were instructed to feed Jesus' sheep with the living bread that is Jesus Christ. Likewise, in living testimony we should teach others to walk the way of righteousness:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *John 6:33* - For the bread of God is he who comes down from heaven and gives life to the world.
#+END_QUOTE

** Even the Old Testament makes a person wise for salvation through faith in Christ Jesus:
Trust and believe:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *Isaiah 53:7-8* - He was oppressed, and he was afflicted, yet he opened not his mouth; like a lamb that is led to the slaughter, and like a sheep that before its shearers is silent, so he opened not his mouth. By oppression and judgment he was taken away; and as for his generation, who considered that he was cut off out of the land of the living, stricken for the transgression of my people? (ESV)
#+END_QUOTE

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *Isaiah 53:12* - Therefore I will divide him a portion with the many, and he shall divide the spoil with the strong, because he poured out his soul to death and was numbered with the transgressors; yet he bore the sin of many, and makes intercession for the transgressors. (ESV)
#+END_QUOTE

Trust and obey:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *II Timothy 3:12-17* - Indeed, all who desire to live a godly life in Christ Jesus will be persecuted, while evil people and impostors will go on from bad to worse, deceiving and being deceived. But as for you, continue in what you have learned and have firmly believed, knowing from whom you learned it and how from childhood you have been *acquainted with the sacred writings*, which _are able to make you wise for salvation through faith in Christ Jesus_. All Scripture is breathed out by God and profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, and for _training in righteousness, that the man of God may be competent, equipped for every good work._ (ESV)
#+END_QUOTE

* My thoughts and bible references regarding theology
I've been thinking about belief, faith, works, law and receiving the Holy Spirit!
Please let me know what you think if you have the time.

I'm trying to get clearer on this.
Please feel free to discuss it with me.

** Jesus
Jesus is the Word incarnate. The world was made through Jesus:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *John 1:9-11* - The true light, which enlightens everyone, was coming into the world. He was in the world, and the world was made through him, yet the world did not know him. He came to his own, and his own people did not receive him. (ESV)
#+END_QUOTE

Jesus is the divinely appointed servant of God:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *Isaiah 53:4-6* - Surely he has borne our griefs and carried our sorrows; yet we esteemed him stricken, smitten by God, and afflicted. But he was wounded for our transgressions; he was crushed for our iniquities; upon him was the chastisement that brought us peace, and with his stripes we are healed. All we like sheep have gone astray; we have turned every one to his own way; and the Lord has laid on him the iniquity of us all. (ESV)
#+END_QUOTE

He's the image of God:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *Colossians 1:15* - He is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of all creation. (ESV)
#+END_QUOTE

** Belief
Jesus has life in Him, and the life is the Light of men - the true Light.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *John 5:26* - For as the Father has life in himself, so he has granted the Son also to have life in himself.
#+END_QUOTE

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *John 5:21* - For as the Father raises the dead and gives them life, so also the Son gives life to whom he will.
#+END_QUOTE

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *John 6:33* - For the bread of God is he who comes down from heaven and gives life to the world.
#+END_QUOTE

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *John 1:4* - In Him was life, and the life was the Light of men. (ESV)
#+END_QUOTE

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *John 1:9* - The true light, which enlightens everyone, was coming into the world. (ESV)
#+END_QUOTE

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *1 John 2:8* -  At the same time, it is a new commandment that I am writing to you, which is true in him and in you, because the darkness is passing away and the true light is already shining.  (ESV)
#+END_QUOTE

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *John 1:6-7* - There came a man sent from God, whose name was John. He came as a witness, to testify about the Light, so that all might believe through him.
#+END_QUOTE

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *John 12:36* - While you have the light, _believe in the light, that you may become sons of light_. When Jesus had said these things, he departed and hid himself from them.
#+END_QUOTE

We testify about the Light, so that through our testimony, others might believe.

To anyone who receives Jesus, even those who believe on His name, Jesus has given the right to become children of God, to be born of God.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *John 1:11-13* - He came to His own, and those who were His own did not receive Him. But _as many as received Him, to them He gave the right to become children of God, even to those who believe (G4100 *pisteuo*) in His name_, who were born, not of blood nor of the will of the flesh nor of the will of man, but of God.
#+END_QUOTE

Yes, I believe that Jesus can save a person who believes in His name. But He is the judge, and it is written in John's gospel that no person who is disobedient to Jesus Christ will see life, and I believe that.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *Revelation of John 3:8* - I know your works. Behold, I have set before you an open door, which no one is able to shut. I know that _you have but little power, and yet you have kept my word and have not denied my name._
#+END_QUOTE

I think Jesus calls us to pursue perfection through following Him, and we should definitely give it a go:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *John 17:23* - I in them and you in me, that _they may become perfectly one,_ so that the world may know that you sent me and loved them even as you loved me.
#+END_QUOTE

Paul presses on to try to achieve a high level of Christlikeness, and his rational is that Jesus made him (Paul) his own (i.e. Jesus loved him),
and Paul loves Jesus back, so he wants to be obedient out of love for Jesus (I'm convinced that's the motivation). He wants to be with Jesus.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *Philippians 3:9-12* - and be found in him, not having a righteousness of my own that comes from the law, but _that which comes through faith in Christ, the righteousness from God that depends on faith_ — that _I may know him and the power of his resurrection, and may share his sufferings, becoming like him in his death,_ _that by any means possible I may attain the resurrection from the dead._ _Not that I have already obtained this or am already perfect, but I press on to make it my own,_ because Christ Jesus has made me his own.
#+END_QUOTE

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *John 12:26* - If anyone serves me, he must follow me; and where I am, there will my servant be also. If anyone serves me, the Father will honor him. (ESV)
#+END_QUOTE

I'm pretty convinced that what Jesus means by the following is that by giving up worldly treasure in the pursuit
of Jesus, heavenly treasure is acquired. I'd say it's likely that the heavenly treasure is simply helping those people.
Selling what a person possesses and giving to the poor is actually serving Jesus, so doing that is already starting to obediently follow Jesus.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *Matthew 19:21* - Jesus said to him, If you would be perfect, go, sell what you possess and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; and come, follow me.
#+END_QUOTE

Jesus' perfect example of patience in mercy towards Paul is to:
- reassure us that we can trust Jesus as we hope for the promise of eternal life to be received from Him,
- for us to see that trusting in Him, we are loved by God and led by His love, following Him in patient [endurance] out of a response of love for Him, trusting in Him, as we receive mercy from Him

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *I Timothy 1:16* - But I received mercy for this reason, that in me, as the foremost, Jesus Christ might display his perfect patience as an example to those who were to believe in him for eternal life. (ESV)
#+END_QUOTE

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *Jude 1:21* - keep yourselves in the love of God, waiting for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ that leads to eternal life. (ESV)
#+END_QUOTE

Whoever truly believes Jesus trusts in and is obedient to Jesus:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *John 3:36* - Whoever believes in the Son has eternal life; whoever does not obey the Son shall not see life, but the wrath of God remains on him. (ESV)
#+END_QUOTE

The word for 'believe' which is used in the New Testament is the verb for faith and actually means to 'trust':
- [[https://medium.com/koinonia/in-john-3-16-believe-means-more-than-believe-b62d350818bc][In John 3:16, 'Believe' Means More than Believe | by Eric Sentell | Koinonia | Medium]]

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  The ancient Greek word for “believe” is
  [[https://biblehub.com/greek/4100.htm][/pisteuó/]], which derives from
  “belief” or “[[https://biblehub.com/greek/4102.htm][/pistis/]].” The
  word “/pistis/” stems from
  [[https://biblehub.com/greek/3982.htm][/peíthō/]], to persuade or be
  persuaded.

  The Greek word /pisteuó/ carries connotations of deep trust and
  confidence. It means to believe, to entrust, to have confidence in
  something.
#+END_QUOTE

*** Faith is not mere belief, but faith is walking as Abraham did
We hear the gospel, and we receive salvation through faith. Reaching it is a journey of applied faith:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *Hebrews 4:1-2* - Therefore, while the promise of entering his rest still stands, let us fear lest any of you should seem to have failed to _reach it._ For good news came to us just as to them, but the message they heard did not benefit them, because they were not _united by faith_ with those who listened. (ESV)
#+END_QUOTE

The demons have belief, but they don't have a response of love towards God:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *James 2:19* - You believe that God is one; you do well. Even the demons believe—and shudder! (ESV)
#+END_QUOTE

We must know that God loved us and sent his Son to be the propitiation for our sins. We must believe:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *I John 4:10* - In this is love, not that we have loved God but that he loved us and sent his Son to be the propitiation for our sins.
#+END_QUOTE

We must obey:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *II John 1:6* - And this is love, that we walk according to his commandments; this is the commandment, just as you have heard from the beginning, so that you should walk in it.
#+END_QUOTE

The knowledge comes from having obeyed God's voice. Love becomes perfected in us when we abide in God:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *I John 4:15-17* - Whoever confesses that Jesus is the Son of God, God abides in him, and he in God. So we have come to know and to believe the love that God has for us. God is love, and whoever abides in love abides in God, and God abides in him. By this is love perfected with us, so that we may have confidence for the day of judgment, because as he is so also are we in this world.
#+END_QUOTE

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *I John 2:4* - Whoever says I know him but does not keep his commandments is a liar, and the truth is not in him, (ESV)
#+END_QUOTE

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *John 8:55* - But you have not known him. I know him. If I were to say that I do not know him, I would be a liar like you, but I do know him and I keep his word. (ESV)
#+END_QUOTE

*** _Faith_ in Jesus Christ's name to be saved
It's _faith in Jesus' name_ that is powerful, and it's with *faith* in Jesus' name that we are saved. We expect to receive salvation:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *Acts 3:2-9* - And a man lame from birth was being carried, whom they laid daily at the gate of the temple that is called the Beautiful Gate to ask alms of those entering the temple. Seeing Peter and John about to go into the temple, he asked to receive alms. And Peter directed his gaze at him, as did John, and said, Look at us. And he fixed his attention on them, _expecting to receive something from them._ But Peter said, I have no silver and gold, but what I do have I give to you. _In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, rise up and walk!_ And _he took him by the right hand and raised him up, and immediately his feet and ankles were made strong. And leaping up he stood and began to walk_, and entered the temple with them, walking and leaping and _praising God._ And all the people saw him walking and praising God,
#+END_QUOTE

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *Acts 3:16* - And his name—by faith in his name—has made this man strong whom you see and know, and the faith that is through Jesus has given the man this perfect health in the presence of you all.
#+END_QUOTE

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *Acts 4:7-10* - And when they had set them in the midst, they inquired, By what power or by what name did you do this? Then Peter, filled with the Holy Spirit, said to them, Rulers of the people and elders, if we are being examined today concerning a good deed done to a crippled man, by what means this man has been healed, let it be known to all of you and to all the people of Israel that by the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, whom you crucified, whom God raised from the dead—by him this man is standing before you well.
#+END_QUOTE

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *Acts 4:12* - And there is salvation in no one else, for there is no other name under heaven given among men by which we must be saved.
#+END_QUOTE

** By God's grace God has saved us and provided us with a means to having faith in Him
God has called us out of darkness and into His marvelous light:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *I Peter 2:9* - But you are a chosen race, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people for his own possession, that you may proclaim the excellencies of him who called you out of darkness into his marvelous light. (ESV)
#+END_QUOTE

Saving faith does come (originate) from hearing through the word of Christ. I believe that saving faith must arrive and settle in the heart:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *Romans 10:17* - So faith comes from hearing, and hearing through the word of Christ. (ESV)
#+END_QUOTE

There are some doctrines that are so essential that to deny them is to not be a Christian:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *I John 4:2* - By this you know the Spirit of God: every spirit that confesses that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is from God, (ESV)
#+END_QUOTE

It's not enough to be saved just by believing that some things are true.
Let's not focus on minimums, but maximums:

[[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMBn3I-Rvi0][John Piper: How Much Error Can I Believe and Still Be Saved? - YouTube]]

I believe that trusting Jesus and obedience in the heart towards Jesus is required.

** Receiving Jesus

*** Receiving Jesus may be as easy as receiving the one who He sends, or receiving a child in His name

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *John 13:20* - Truly, truly, I say to you, whoever receives the one I send receives me, and whoever receives me receives the one who sent me.
#+END_QUOTE

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *Mark 9:37* - Whoever receives one such child in my name receives me, and whoever receives me, receives not me but him who sent me.
#+END_QUOTE

A person may need to ask and seek to receive Jesus:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *Luke 11:10* - For everyone who asks receives, and the one who seeks finds, and to the one who knocks it will be opened.
#+END_QUOTE

*** Those who have a heart of faith towards Him (and anyone who He wills) may receive forgiveness of sins through his name

An heart of faith looks like:
- Wanting to do God's will
  - Obedience and repentance from sin: even if it just means _wanting to turn from sin_
  - because God makes the new heart to enable the person to obey
- Wanting to follow Jesus
- Accepting Jesus Christ as one's Lord
- Accepting through faith the atonement for sin through Jesus Christ

God provides the new heart:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *Ezekiel 11:19-20* - And I will give them one heart, and a new spirit I will put within them. I will remove the heart of stone from their flesh and give them a heart of flesh, that they may walk in my statutes and keep my rules and obey them. And they shall be my people, and I will be their God. (ESV)
#+END_QUOTE

So to be saved a person must have an obedient heart, prepared for the good works which are prepared for us to walk in:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *Ephesians 2:8-10* - For by grace you have been saved through faith. And this is not your own doing; it is the gift of God, not a result of works, so that no one may boast. For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God prepared beforehand, that we should walk in them.
#+END_QUOTE

The tax collector here has an obedient heart (yielding to Jesus), but the Pharisee in the story has a self-righteous heart:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *Luke 18:9-14* - He also told this parable to some who trusted in themselves that they were righteous, and treated others with contempt: Two men went up into the temple to pray, one a Pharisee and the other a tax collector. The Pharisee, standing by himself, prayed thus: God, I thank you that I am not like other men, extortioners, unjust, adulterers, or even like this tax collector. I fast twice a week; I give tithes of all that I get. _But the tax collector, standing far off, would not even lift up his eyes to heaven, but beat his breast, saying, God, be merciful to me, a sinner! I tell you, this man went down to his house justified, rather than the other._ For everyone who exalts himself will be humbled, but the one who humbles himself will be exalted.his house justified, rather than the other._ For everyone who exalts himself will be humbled, but the one who humbles himself will be exalted.
#+END_QUOTE

It's those that believe in him (trust Him, receive Him, _expect to receive Him_, have an obedient heart towards Him) that receive forgiveness of sins through his name:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *Acts 10:41-44* - not to all the people but to us who had been chosen by God as witnesses, who ate and drank with him after he rose from the dead. And he commanded us to preach to the people and to testify that he is the one appointed by God to be judge of the living and the dead. To him all the prophets bear witness that _everyone who believes in him receives forgiveness of sins through his name._ While Peter was still saying these things, the Holy Spirit fell on all who heard the word. (ESV)
#+END_QUOTE

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *John 6:63* - It is the Spirit who gives life; the flesh is of no avail. The words that I have spoken to you are spirit and life.
#+END_QUOTE

We _must honour Jesus Christ in our bodies and in our lives_ - fruitful labour, so that we can be confident with =John 5-24=:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *John 5:21-24* - For as the Father raises the dead and gives them life, so also the Son gives life to whom he will. The Father judges no one, but has given all judgment to the Son, that all may honor the Son, just as they honor the Father. _Whoever does not honor the Son does not honor the Father who sent him_. Truly, truly, I say to you, whoever _hears my word and believes (G4100 *pisteuo*) him who sent me has eternal life_. He does not come into judgment, but has passed from death to life.
#+END_QUOTE

I believe =John 5:24= is a true statement and that it should not be read outside of the words Jesus said directly before it (=Whoever does not honor the Son does not honor the Father who sent him=).

We do not nullify the rest of what Jesus has commanded of and asked of us. If Jesus is your judge, then I think it's wise to take on board the rest of what Jesus has said:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *Philippians 1:15-22* - Some indeed preach Christ from envy and rivalry, but others from good will. The latter do it out of love, knowing that I am put here for the defense of the gospel. The former proclaim Christ out of rivalry, not sincerely but thinking to afflict me in my imprisonment. What then? Only that in every way, whether in pretense or in truth, Christ is proclaimed, and in that I rejoice. Yes, and I will rejoice, for I know that through your prayers and the help of the Spirit of Jesus Christ this will turn out for my deliverance, as _it is my eager expectation and hope that I will not be at all ashamed, but that with full courage now as always Christ will be honored in my body, whether by life or by death_. For to me to live is Christ, and to die is gain. _If I am to live in the flesh, that means fruitful labor for me._ Yet which I shall choose I cannot tell.
#+END_QUOTE

Paul and the other faithful Apostles were exhibited as last of all, like men sentenced to death for following Jesus:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *I Corinthians 4:9* - For I think that God has exhibited us apostles as last of all, like men sentenced to death, because we have become a spectacle to the world, to angels, and to men.
#+END_QUOTE

God still makes apostles and prophetic people:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *Ephesians 4:11-16* - And he gave the apostles, the prophets, the evangelists, the pastors and teachers, to equip the saints for the work of ministry, for building up the body of Christ, until we all attain to the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God, to mature manhood, to the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ, so that we may no longer be children, tossed to and fro by the waves and carried about by every wind of doctrine, by human cunning, by craftiness in deceitful schemes. Rather, speaking the truth in love, we are to grow up in every way into him who is the head, into Christ, from whom the whole body, joined and held together by every joint with which it is equipped, when each part is working properly, makes the body grow so that it builds itself up in love.
#+END_QUOTE

God is loving and altogether gracious.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *Exodus 34:5-8* - The Lord descended in the cloud and stood with him there, and proclaimed the name of the Lord. The Lord passed before him and proclaimed, The Lord, the Lord, a God merciful and gracious, slow to anger, and abounding in steadfast love and faithfulness, keeping steadfast love for thousands, forgiving iniquity and transgression and sin, but who will by no means clear the guilty, visiting the iniquity of the fathers on the children and the children's children, to the third and the fourth generation. And Moses quickly bowed his head toward the earth and worshiped.
#+END_QUOTE

Having faith in God involves following Jesus:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *Hebrews 10:32-39* - But recall the former days when, _after you were enlightened, you endured a hard struggle with sufferings, sometimes being publicly exposed to reproach and affliction_, and sometimes being partners with those so treated. For you had compassion on those in prison, and you joyfully accepted the plundering of your property, since you knew that you yourselves had a better possession and an abiding one. Therefore do not throw away your confidence, which has a great reward. For you have need of endurance, so that _when you have done the will of God you may receive what is promised_. For, Yet a little while, and the coming one will come and will not delay; but my righteous one shall live by faith, and if he shrinks back, my soul has no pleasure in him. But _we are not of those who shrink back and are destroyed, but of those who have faith and preserve their souls_.

Jesus' sheep:
- hear Jesus' voice
- follow Him (they're being obedient)
- Jesus knows them

I believe that what this says is that at the point Jesus knows you listen to His voice and obey His voice, He counts you as one of His sheep and He will not let you go.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *Romans 4:9-12* - Is this blessing then only for the circumcised, or also for the uncircumcised? We say that faith was counted to Abraham as righteousness. How then was it counted to him? Was it before or after he had been circumcised? It was not after, but before he was circumcised. He received the sign of circumcision as a seal of the righteousness that he had by faith while he was still uncircumcised. The purpose was to make him the father of all who believe without being circumcised, so that righteousness would be counted to them as well, and to make him the father of the circumcised who are _not merely circumcised but who also walk in the footsteps of the faith that our father Abraham had before he was circumcised_.

Abraham had _righteousness attributed to him when he believed God, while he had an obedient and faithful heart towards God:_

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *Genesis 15:5-6* - And he brought him outside and said, Look toward heaven, and number the stars, if you are able to number them. Then he said to him, So shall your offspring be. And he believed the Lord, and he counted it to him as righteousness.

The blessing was _assured to him by God because of obedience_ (the obedient works of faith brought him _assurance_ for God's blessing):

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *Genesis 22:17-18* - I will surely bless you, and I will surely multiply your offspring as the stars of heaven and as the sand that is on the seashore.

Therefore, we should believe with an obedient heart, and obey to receive God's assurance.

I believe that every one of Jesus' sheep have a believing, obedient heart, and Jesus knows
who they are and no-one will be able to snatch them from Jesus' hand.

I personally believe that it's God's role to justify, not ours, and if we want personal assurance that we are saved, we
must seek and follow Jesus, and arrive at the door.

Abraham was obedient the entire time, even when God counted Abraham's belief as righteousness.
We should, likewise _be obedient when we believe._
Abraham was _justified when He believed with an obedient heart_ but faith was _completed by the works of faith_ and Abraham was given assurance of the blessing:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *James 2:21-23* - Was not Abraham our father justified by works when he offered up his son Isaac on the altar? You see that faith was active along with his works, and faith was completed by his works; and the Scripture was fulfilled that says, Abraham believed God, and it was counted to him as righteousness—and he was called a friend of God. (ESV)

Without an obedient heart the so-called belief _doesn't qualify as belief._ Anyone who claims to have faith in Jesus, yet does not obey Him is a liar:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE

#+END_QUOTE

Abraham believed and obeyed:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *Genesis 26:4-5* - I will multiply your offspring as the stars of heaven and will give to your offspring all these lands. And in your offspring all the nations of the earth shall be blessed, because Abraham obeyed my voice and kept my charge, my commandments, my statutes, and my laws. (ESV)
#+END_QUOTE

In this way we must have faith in God the Father of Jesus Christ, and believe and obey Jesus because God commanded it.

According to Paul, Abraham trusted God and that trust he had meant he didn't
waver concerning the promise of God, but he grew strong in his faith as he have
glory to God.

That's right, and Abraham's faith included:
- faithfulness
- giving glory to God
- obedience
- works of faith

What I mean to say is, the trust in God that Abraham had concerning the promise
of God is exhibited plainly in Abraham's action, and was faithful, enduring,
unwavering, over an amount of time.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *Romans 4:20-25* - No distrust made him waver concerning the promise of God, but he grew strong in his faith as he gave glory to God, fully convinced that God was able to do what he had promised. That is why his faith was counted to him as righteousness. But the words it was counted to him were not written for his sake alone, but for ours also. It will be counted to us who believe in him who raised from the dead Jesus our Lord, who was delivered up for our trespasses and raised for our justification.
#+END_QUOTE

Therefore, when we trust wholeheartedly in God who has raised from the dead Jesus Christ (who is our Lord, meaning we obey Him),
and because we believe, we then inevitably produce working faith.

Our faith is exhibited plainly in our action. Our own actions and way of expressing that faith paint a unique picture, with a faith towards God
that may be expressed a little bit differently, in different works of faith, or simply keeping Jesus Christ's words and not denying His name - patient endurance.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *Colossians 3:17* - And whatever you do, in word or deed, do everything in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God the Father through him.

#+END_QUOTE

If a person has an obedient and believing heart - a heart of faith - towards Jesus, then they _will be_ saved:
- If a person truthfully confesses (admits) with their mouth that Jesus is Lord, they have an obedient heart.
  - This must result in the person obeying Jesus; freely forgiving others, loving others as He loved us, _keeping Jesus' commandments_
- If they believe in their heart that God raised Jesus from the dead, they believe Jesus, and believe God who sent Him.
  - This must result in the person accepting forgiveness for sin

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *Romans 10:9* - because, if you confess with your mouth that Jesus is Lord and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved. (ESV)
#+END_QUOTE

I believe that a person does not have any _security_ of eternal salvation unless they have in their heart _obedient, believing faith_ in Jesus Christ, and even then there is often a race and a journey to receive it.

The knowledge of the truth is for those who abide in Jesus' word and follow Him:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *John 8:31-32* - So Jesus said to the Jews who had believed in him, If you abide in my word, you are truly my disciples, and you will know the truth, and the truth will set you free.
#+END_QUOTE

I believe that obedience is as intrinsic and necessary to faith as belief is.

# In other words, I believe one must make Jesus Christ their Lord *and* their Saviour for any guarantee at being saved; one must have obedient faith in the heart, not just the head.

# The _heart_ must truly believe. And a person with a believing heart is obedient to Jesus, and if they're not obedient to Jesus then they don't have a believing heart, and haven't arrived at His rest.

# That's why there's a receiving of salvation through faith and a 'reaching' of God's rest. Faith requires obedience to Jesus because if someone reaches the rest, they have united the message with faith and been tested:

The good news must be united by obedient faith (putting Jesus' words into action):

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *Hebrews 4:1-2* - Therefore, while the promise of entering his rest still stands, let us fear lest any of you should seem to have failed to reach it. For good news came to us just as to them, but the message they heard did not benefit them, because they were not united by faith with those who listened. (ESV)

And I also think people have free will to sabotage their race.

Clearly believe means also to be obedient to because the ones that _follow Jesus_ (which means obey His commandments) are the ones who are counted as believing (*pisteuo*):

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *John 10:26-38* - but you do not believe (G4100 *pisteuo*) because you are not part of my flock.

But at midnight there was a cry, Here is the bridegroom! Come out to meet him. Then all those virgins rose and trimmed their lamps. And the foolish said to the wise, Give us some of your oil, for our lamps are going out. But the wise answered, saying, Since there will not be enough for us and for you, go rather to the dealers and buy for yourselves. And while they were going to buy, the bridegroom came, and those who were ready went in with him to the marriage feast, and the door was shut.

Good work is rewarded. Lazy, disobedient belief is punished, and the worthless servant who was entrusted with some work but was unfaithful with his work (doesn't matter how much work it is) is cast away. Jesus isn't a hard taskmaster but wants our whole heart. Jesus must be our Master:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *Matthew 25:14-30* - For it will be like a man going on a journey, who called his servants and entrusted to them his property. To one he gave five talents, to another two, to another one, to each according to his ability. Then he went away. He who had received the five talents went at once and traded with them, and he made five talents more. So also he who had the two talents made two talents more. But he who had received the one talent went and dug in the ground and hid his master's money. Now after a long time the master of those servants came and settled accounts with them. And he who had received the five talents came forward, bringing five talents more, saying, Master, you delivered to me five talents; here I have made five talents more. _His master said to him, Well done, good and faithful servant._ You have been faithful over a little; I will set you over much. Enter into the joy of your master. And he also who had the two talents came forward, saying, Master, you delivered to me two talents; here I have made two talents more. His master said to him, Well done, good and faithful servant. You have been faithful over a little; I will set you over much. Enter into the joy of your master. He also who had received the one talent came forward, saying, Master, I knew you to be a hard man, reaping where you did not sow, and gathering where you scattered no seed, so I was afraid, and I went and hid your talent in the ground. Here you have what is yours. But his master answered him, You wicked and slothful servant! You knew that I reap where I have not sowed and gather where I scattered no seed? Then you ought to have invested my money with the bankers, and at my coming I should have received what was my own with interest. So take the talent from him and give it to him who has the ten talents. For to everyone who has will more be given, and he will have an abundance. But from the one who has not, even what he has will be taken away. And cast the _worthless servant_ into the outer darkness. In that place there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.

And he will place the sheep on his right, but the goats on the left. Then the King will say to those on his right, Come, you who are blessed by my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world. For I was hungry and you gave me food, I was thirsty and you gave me drink, I was a stranger and you welcomed me, _I was naked and you clothed me, I was sick and you visited me, I was in prison and you came to me._ Then the righteous will answer him, saying, Lord, when did we see you hungry and feed you, or thirsty and give you drink? And when did we see you a stranger and welcome you, or naked and clothe you? And when did we see you sick or in prison and visit you?

Repentance:
- Someone who has _only belief in the gift of grace and no obedience to Jesus_ (which is effectively hating Jesus) _must repent_ and come to have an obedient heart.

If people from either category do not repent, then beware because God has the ability and jurisdiction to _cast that person out - graft them out of Christ._ Also, let's not become proud, but stand in awe.

Walking in obedient faith is walking in forgiveness and love towards other people, forgiveness and love that flows out from _having been_ loved and having been forgiven.

The faith working through love towards God and other people flows out of believing in and accepting Jesus and His atoning sacrifice and from being freely forgiven by Jesus.

I think the person who has arrived at this point has repented from dead work and is now living for Jesus.

*** We must have a changed heart, which longs to serve the living God, to be a bondservant of Jesus. AMEN!!
God gives us the new heart when we seek to have that new heart.

To be saved we need to have an obedient heart to God.

_Will to do God's will_ - will to be obedient, and God will give you the heart to obey Him.

When you trust Jesus, you will to do His will.

Living as a new Creation in Christ means God has given you the heart to desire to obey Jesus' commandments. We are under Christ's law.

It means, through the power of the Holy Spirit, to no longer practice lying, adultery, idolatry, and covetousness, and to no longer dishonour our parents, and to now honour Jesus Christ in our lives and bodies.

It's going from disobedience to God (as Adam was disobedient) to obedience to God (as Christ is obedient):

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *John 3:16-21* - For God so loved the world, that he gave his only Son, that whoever (G3956 pas) believes (G4100 pisteuo) in him should not perish but have eternal life. For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but in order that the world might be saved through him. Whoever believes in him is not condemned, but whoever does not believe is condemned already, because he has not believed in the name of the only Son of God. And this is the judgment: the light has come into the world, and people loved the darkness rather than the light because their deeds were evil. For everyone who does wicked things hates the light and does not come to the light, lest his deeds should be exposed. But _whoever does what is true comes to the light_, so that _it may be clearly seen that his deeds have been carried out in God_. (ESV)
#+END_QUOTE

The gospel involves having _believing_ *and* _obedient_ heart. It must start with one or the other, but should arrive at both.

Whoever _does what is true comes to the light._

_Whoever has faith in and puts their trust in in Jesus Christ is not condemned and should not perish._

We must honour Jesus Christ:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *John 5:21-24* - For as the Father raises the dead and gives them life, so also the Son gives life to whom he will. The Father judges no one, but has given all judgment to the Son, that all may honor the Son, just as they honor the Father. _Whoever does not honor the Son does not honor the Father who sent him_. Truly, truly, I say to you, whoever _hears my word and believes (G4100 *pisteuo*) him who sent me has eternal life_. He does not come into judgment, but has passed from death to life.
#+END_QUOTE

I believe =John 5:24= is a true statement and that it should not be read outside of the words Jesus said directly before it (=Whoever does not honor the Son does not honor the Father who sent him=).

Only that in every way, whether in pretense or in truth, Christ is proclaimed, and in that I rejoice. Yes, and I will rejoice, for I know that through your prayers and the help of the Spirit of Jesus Christ this will turn out for my deliverance, as _it is my eager expectation and hope that I will not be at all ashamed, but that with full courage now as always Christ will be honored in my body, whether by life or by death_. For to me to live is Christ, and to die is gain. _If I am to live in the flesh, that means fruitful labor for me._ Yet which I shall choose I cannot tell.

  *Hebrews 10:10-17* - And by that will we have been sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all. And every priest stands daily at his service, offering repeatedly the same sacrifices, which can never take away sins. But when _Christ had offered for all time a single sacrifice for sins,_ he sat down at the right hand of God, waiting from that time until his enemies should be made a footstool for his feet. For by a single offering he has perfected for all time those who are being sanctified. And the Holy Spirit also bears witness to us; for after saying, This is the covenant that I will make with them after those days, declares the Lord: I will put my laws on their hearts, and write them on their minds, then he adds, I will remember their sins and their lawless deeds no more.

  *John 5:17-29* - But Jesus answered them, My Father is working until now, and I am working. This was why the Jews were seeking all the more to kill him, because not only was he breaking the Sabbath, but he was even calling God his own Father, making himself equal with God. So Jesus said to them, Truly, truly, I say to you, the Son can do nothing of his own accord, but only what he sees the Father doing. For whatever the Father does, that the Son does likewise. For the Father loves the Son and shows him all that he himself is doing. And greater works than these will he show him, so that you may marvel. For as the Father raises the dead and gives them life, so also the Son gives life to whom he will. The Father judges no one, but has given all judgment to the Son, that all may honor the Son, just as they honor the Father. _Whoever does not honor the Son does not honor the Father who sent him._ Truly, truly, I say to you, _whoever hears my word and believes him who sent me has eternal life. He does not come into judgment, but has passed from death to life._ Truly, truly, I say to you, an hour is coming, and is now here, when the dead will hear the voice of the Son of God, and those who hear will live. For as the Father has life in himself, so he has granted the Son also to have life in himself. And he has given him authority to execute judgment, because he is the Son of Man. Do not marvel at this, for an hour is coming when all who are in the tombs will hear his voice and come out, _those who have done good to the resurrection of life, and those who have done evil to the resurrection of judgment._ (ESV)

This is evidence of the righteous judgment of God, that you may be considered worthy of the kingdom of God, for which you are also suffering— since indeed God considers it just to repay with affliction those who afflict you, and to grant relief to you who are afflicted as well as to us, when the Lord Jesus is revealed from heaven with his mighty angels in flaming fire, inflicting vengeance on those who do not know God and on those who do not obey the gospel of our Lord Jesus.

But rejoice insofar as you share Christ's sufferings, that you may also rejoice and be glad when his glory is revealed. If you are insulted for the name of Christ, you are blessed, because the Spirit of glory and of God rests upon you. But let none of you suffer as a murderer or a thief or an evildoer or as a meddler. Yet if anyone suffers as a Christian, let him not be ashamed, but let him glorify God in that name. _For it is time for judgment to begin at the household of God; and if it begins with us, what will be the outcome for those who do not obey the gospel of God?_ And If the righteous is scarcely saved, what will become of the ungodly and the sinner? Therefore let those who suffer according to God's will entrust their souls to a faithful Creator while doing good.

#+BEGIN_SRC text -n :async :results verbatim code :lang text
  We believe in one God,
        the Father almighty,
        maker of heaven and earth,
        of all things visible and invisible.

  And in one Lord Jesus Christ,
        the only Son of God,
        begotten from the Father before all ages,
             God from God,
             Light from Light,
             true God from true God,
        begotten, not made;
        of the same essence as the Father.
        Through him all things were made.
        For us and for our salvation
             he came down from heaven;
             he became incarnate by the Holy Spirit and the virgin Mary,
             and was made human.
             He was crucified for us under Pontius Pilate;
             he suffered and was buried.
             The third day he rose again, according to the Scriptures.
             He ascended to heaven
             and is seated at the right hand of the Father.
             He will come again with glory
             to judge the living and the dead.
             His kingdom will never end.

  And we believe in the Holy Spirit,
        the Lord, the giver of life.
        He proceeds from the Father and the Son,
        and with the Father and the Son is worshiped and glorified.
        He spoke through the prophets.
        We believe in one holy catholic and apostolic church.
        We affirm one baptism for the forgiveness of sins.
        We look forward to the resurrection of the dead,
        and to life in the world to come. Amen.

For they drank from the spiritual Rock that followed them, and the Rock was Christ. Nevertheless, _with most of them God was not pleased, for they were overthrown in the wilderness. Now these things took place as examples for us, that we might not desire evil as they did. Do not be idolaters as some of them were;_ as it is written, The people sat down to eat and drink and rose up to play.

Now these things happened to them as an example, but they were written down for our instruction, on whom the end of the ages has come. Therefore _let anyone who thinks that he stands take heed lest he fall._ No temptation has overtaken you that is not common to man.

Keep your tongue from evil and your lips from speaking deceit. Turn away from evil and do good; seek peace and pursue it. _The eyes of the Lord are toward the righteous and his ears toward their cry_. The face of the Lord is against those who do evil, to cut off the memory of them from the earth. When the righteous cry for help, the Lord hears and delivers them out of all their troubles. The Lord is near to the brokenhearted and saves the crushed in spirit. Many are the afflictions of the righteous, but the Lord delivers him out of them all. He keeps all his bones; not one of them is broken. Affliction will slay the wicked, and those who hate the righteous will be condemned. The Lord redeems the life of his servants; none of those who take refuge in him will be condemned.

  *Galatians 1:15-20*- But when he who had set me apart before I was born, and who called me by his grace, was pleased to reveal his Son to me, in order that I might preach him among the Gentiles, I did not immediately consult with anyone; nor did I go up to Jerusalem to those who were apostles before me, but I went away into Arabia, and returned again to Damascus. Then after three years I went up to Jerusalem to visit Cephas and remained with him fifteen days. But I saw none of the other apostles except James the Lord's brother. (In what I am writing to you, before God, I do not lie! )
#+END_QUOTE

Interestingly, James believes that a person is justified not by faith alone, but by works of faith:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *James 2:21-24* - Was not Abraham our father justified by works when he offered up Isaac his son on the altar? You see that faith was working with his works, and as a result of the works, faith was perfected; and the Scripture was fulfilled which says, “And Abraham believed God, and it was reckoned to him as righteousness,” and he was called the friend of God. You see that a man is justified by works and not by faith alone.
#+END_QUOTE

Fear-of-God:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *Romans 4:5-8* - And to the one who does not work but trusts him who justifies the ungodly, his faith is counted as righteousness, just as David also speaks of the blessing of the one to whom God counts righteousness apart from works: Blessed are those whose lawless deeds are forgiven, and whose sins are covered; blessed is the man against whom the Lord will not count his sin.
#+END_QUOTE

AMEN!! But this doesn't mean the other elements of working faith can't play a part.

We may rest from our labors when we die in the Lord:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *Revelation of John 14:13* - And I heard a voice from heaven saying, Write this: Blessed are the dead who die in the Lord from now on. Blessed indeed, says the Spirit, that they may rest from their labors, for their deeds follow them! (ESV)
#+END_QUOTE

Circumcision of the flesh does not matter:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *Romans 4:9-12* - Is this blessing then only for the circumcised, or also for the uncircumcised? We say that faith was counted to Abraham as righteousness. How then was it counted to him? Was it before or after he had been circumcised? It was not after, but before he was circumcised. He received the sign of circumcision as a seal of the righteousness that he had by faith while he was still uncircumcised. The purpose was to make him the father of all who believe (G4100 pisteuo) without being circumcised, so that righteousness would be counted to them as well, and to make him the father of the circumcised who are not merely circumcised but who also walk in the footsteps of the faith that our father Abraham had before he was circumcised.
#+END_QUOTE

We must share the faith of Abraham to receive the grace:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *Romans 4:13-17* - For the promise to Abraham and his offspring that he would be heir of the world did not come through the law but through the righteousness of faith. For if it is the adherents of the law who are to be the heirs, faith is null and the promise is void. For the law brings wrath, but where there is no law there is no transgression. That is why it depends on faith, in order that the promise may rest on grace and be guaranteed to all his offspring—not only to the adherent of the law but also to the one who shares the faith of Abraham, who is the father of us all, as it is written, I have made you the father of many nations—in the presence of the God in whom he believed, who gives life to the dead and calls into existence the things that do not exist.
#+END_QUOTE

In hope, Abraham believed against hope. He didn't weaken in faith, even when it seemed impossible.
He trusted and believed God, and grew strong in his faith and gave glory to God. _We should do the same._

We must believe on Him (God) who raised Jesus from the dead, with the faith that Abraham had - Abraham's faith was working, but it wasn't the works that justified Him, it was the faith.

If a person lives their life as a living sacrifice to honour and serve Jesus Christ, which is honouring and having faith in God, then all of that is analogous to Abraham's works of faith.

We must trust God in hope against hope, and not weaken in faith, and trust God's promise, and honour Jesus Christ with our lives - that is what I believe.

The most important thing is this faith - but God certainly uses our works of faith:

Our salvation comes from faith alone in God for the promise of forgiveness from sin and hope of eternal life with Christ Jesus for those who believe in God who raised Jesus Christ from the dead, our Lord, who was delivered up for our trespasses and raised for our justification.

It's because of what Jesus Christ has done that we are justified, not because of anything we have done. We must trust in God to justify us we hold to our faith.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *Romans 4:18-25* - _In hope he believed (G4100 pisteuo) against hope_, that he should become the father of many nations, as he had been told, So shall your offspring be. He did not weaken in faith when he considered his own body, which was as good as dead (since he was about a hundred years old), or when he considered the barrenness of Sarah's womb. No distrust made him waver concerning the promise of God, but he grew strong in his faith as he gave glory to God, fully convinced that God was able to do what he had promised. That is why his faith was counted to him as righteousness. But the words it was counted to him were not written for his sake alone, but for ours also. _It will be counted to us who believe (G4100 pisteuo) in him who raised from the dead Jesus our Lord, who was delivered up for our trespasses and raised for our justification._
#+END_QUOTE

Therefore, do not put your hope on how little faith you can have for Jesus Christ to scrape through (because Jesus Christ is the judge), but instead live for Him sincerely, doing as He has instructed us.

To follow and obey Jesus Christ with the same type of faith that Abraham had - that is what we should be doing - that's saving faith, I think. Our justification is based on what Jesus Christ has done.

Now as we live by faith, we are justified by this faith and have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ who we are _believing, following, obeying and honouring._

And we only have access to the grace if we have faith:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *Romans 5:1-2* - Therefore, since we have been justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ. Through him we have also obtained access by faith into this grace in which we stand, and we rejoice in hope of the glory of God.

And he was seeking to see who Jesus was, but on account of the crowd he could not, because he was small of stature. So he ran on ahead and climbed up into a sycamore tree to see him, for he was about to pass that way. And when Jesus came to the place, he looked up and said to him, Zacchaeus, hurry and come down, for I must stay at your house today. So he hurried and came down and received him joyfully. And when they saw it, they all grumbled, He has gone in to be the guest of a man who is a sinner. And Zacchaeus stood and said to the Lord, Behold, Lord, the half of my goods I give to the poor. And if I have defrauded anyone of anything, I restore it fourfold. _And Jesus said to him, Today salvation has come to this house, since he also is a son of Abraham. For the Son of Man came to seek and to save the lost._ (ESV)

We have to have faith which is characteristic of Abraham's faith, but with regards to following the Lord Jesus.

Our justification comes from having trusting faith in God our Father, who has raised from the dead Jesus Christ
our *Lord* (our brother who we obey); the Jesus Christ who
was delivered up for our trespasses and raised
from the dead for our justification.

Obeying God is obeying Jesus. Having faith in God is having faith in Jesus.

He was raised *for* our justification; now in order to be justified by faith, we simply need to put our faith in Him and follow Him.

We have to die to our old self and live for Christ, simply abiding in Him.

If we walk in the footsteps of the faith that our father Abraham had before he was circumcised, but having faith in God by obeying Jesus Christ who was raised for our justification then we have Jesus Christ's righteousness; we have the righteeousness of faith in God.

  *Romans 3:19-20* - Now we know that whatever the law says it speaks to those who are under the law, so that every mouth may be stopped, and the whole world may be held accountable to God. For by works of the law no human being will be justified in his sight, since through the law comes knowledge of sin. (ESV)

The law is still used in judgement, but the one who has faith in Jesus is not condemned.

The law is good and just and Jesus both obeyed it flawlessly, but He also fulfilled it like a prophesy.

*** Didache
The Didache's estimated range of dating is 50-120 A.D, according to [[https://www.earlychristianwritings.com/text/didache-roberts.html][earlychristianwritings.com]].

What I like about the Didache is that it upholds righteous living and following God's Great commandments and precepts.

[[https://www.earlychristianwritings.com/text/didache-roberts.html][Didache: The Lord's Teaching Through the Twelve Apostles to the Nations]]

I think it's important to live righteously out of love for God and one's neighbour, and out of faith.

That being said, I think God does justify through faith, and I believe faith works. And working may indeed be called faith if the work is done in faith.
I also think God likely saves through works because it may be their way of demonstrating faith to Jesus.

*** Our point of reference

Through faith we are justified, but we should absolutely stop sinning

We are sanctified by the Spirit *and* faith in the truth (taking God's words as True and using them to combat lies):

#+BEGIN_QUOTE

(NASB)

Think of Jesus here:
- _keep His commandments_
- _obey His voice_
- _serve Him_
- _hold fast to Him_

Christians must do this.

Those who are in the faith _can't do anything against the truth_ - So those who are in the faith find no contradiction:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *II Corinthians 13:5-8* - Examine yourselves, to see whether you are in the faith. Test yourselves. Or do you not realize this about yourselves, that Jesus Christ is in you? —unless indeed you fail to meet the test! I hope you will find out that we have not failed the test. But we pray to God that you may not do wrong—not that we may appear to have met the test, but that you may do what is right, though we may seem to have failed. For we cannot do anything against the truth, but only for the truth.

When the perishable puts on the imperishable, and the mortal puts on immortality, then shall come to pass the saying that is written: Death is swallowed up in victory. O death, where is your victory? O death, where is your sting? The sting of death is sin, and the power of sin is the law. But thanks be to God, who gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ. Therefore, my beloved brothers, be steadfast, immovable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, knowing that in the Lord your labor is not in vain. (ESV)

Adhering strictly to the Mosaic law is not needed to be justified by God if we believe in and follow Jesus:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *Galatians 3:15-18* - To give a human example, brothers: even with a man-made covenant, no one annuls it or adds to it once it has been ratified. Now the promises were made to Abraham and to his offspring. It does not say, And to offsprings, referring to many, but referring to one, And to your offspring, who is Christ. This is what I mean: the law, which came 430 years afterward, does not annul a covenant previously ratified by God, so as to make the promise void. For if the inheritance comes by the law, it no longer comes by promise; but God gave it to Abraham by a promise.
#+END_QUOTE

*** Purity of heart

The Mosaic law is not really in the same category as the 10 commandments, I believe. The 10 commandments if obeyed in truth from the heart would result in a clean heart, I think. So it serves to describe what a pure heart looks like, and the laws we should always try to keep whether Gentile or Jew:

For sin will have no dominion over you, since you are not under law but under grace.  What then? Are we to sin because we are not under law but under grace? By no means!  Do you not know that if you present yourselves to anyone as obedient slaves, you are slaves of the one whom you obey, either of sin, which leads to death, or of *obedience, which leads to righteousness*?  But thanks be to God, that you who were once slaves of sin have become *obedient from the heart to the standard of teaching to which you were committed*, and, having been set free from sin, have become *slaves of righteousness*.  I am speaking in human terms, because of your natural limitations. For just as you once presented your members as slaves to impurity and to lawlessness leading to more lawlessness, so now present your members as slaves to righteousness leading to sanctification.  When you were slaves of sin, you were free in regard to righteousness.  But what fruit were you getting at that time from the things of which you are now ashamed? The end of those things is death.  But now that you have been _set free from sin and have become slaves of God, the fruit you get leads to sanctification and its end, eternal life.  For the wages of sin is death, but the free gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord_.

Rather than fill my mind with other people's doctrines and religion, we should obey God, knowing God knows.

Also endeavor to also do lots of service as that is what Jesus' Kingdom is all about.

* Repentance from sin
** Parable of the prodigal son - God's joy over a sinner that repents from sin
#+BEGIN_SRC text -n :async :results verbatim code :lang text
  prodigal
      Wasteful.

      Spending money or using resources freely
      and recklessly; wastefully extravagant.
      "prodigal habits die hard"

      A person who spends money in a recklessly
      extravagant way.
      "he hated rich prodigals who lived
      useless, imprudent lives"
#+END_SRC

The story of the prodigal son is about a person coming to repentance, and there is great joy over it.
It's not saying that following God's commandments are wrong.
It's not even saying that 'rulekeeping' is wrong.
It does say that sin leads to destruction.
It also says that God and the angels are overjoyed when people repent from sin and turn back to Him, and that God forgives and welcomes us back when we do this.

I believe that after being [[https://web.archive.org/web/20220402091720/https://mullikine.github.io/posts/astral-projection/][born-again of the spirit]], I had (with very little knowledge of Jesus' commandments) had to learn Jesus' commandments and apply them, and I believe the Holy Spirit taught me to obey Jesus as I read Jesus' sayings and was subsequently tested on those sayings. For example, if I read that we must give to all who ask, and then the Lord sets up a situation where someone asks for money, then I have a choice to obey Jesus, which means resisting those who try to deter me from obeying Jesus. Upon being tested, someone would offer worldly wisdom in an attempt to deter me from following Jesus, and as I obey God I am led by the Holy Spirit, and taught by the Holy Spirit. And this is an ongoing process. I say this for others' sake to explain how I have come to know how faith in Jesus, following Jesus, works practically, that it is more than mere intellectual belief to be led by the Spirit, but it is also obedience, and a process of sanctification, and walking in the light.

We must die to sin and practice righteousness.

Then while practicing righteousness after dying to sin, we may suffer for practicing righteousness.
Therefore this righteousness is a personal righteousness, which we practice after dying to sin.

Faith working through love is obeying Jesus.

* Justifying faith vs justifying works is misunderstood and is a false dichotomy
There's a false dichotomy between faith and works - because obedience is intrinsic to faith.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *John 6:28-29* - Then they said to him, _What must we do, to be doing the works of God?_ Jesus answered them, This is the work of God, that *you believe (G4100 pisteuo) in him whom he has sent.* (ESV)
#+END_QUOTE

True faith is always obedient; faith is always prepared to obey more:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *John 7:17*- If anyone's will is to do God's will, he will know whether the teaching is from God or whether I am speaking on my own authority.
#+END_QUOTE

You can't even have faith in God without obeying Jesus because the one who has faith in God has already obeyed Jesus whether they know about =Mark 11:22 or not=. So it's not a dead work.

And justifying faith is having obedient faith in God with regards to the promise given to Abraham.

Obeying God *is* having faith in God. Obeying God *is* loving God. AMEN!!

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *Mark 11:22* - And Jesus answered them, Have (G2192 echo) faith (G4102 *pistis*) in God (G2316 theos). (ESV)
#+END_QUOTE

*pistis* is the faith noun.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *John 14:1* - “Do not let your heart be troubled; believe (G4100 *pisteuo*) in God, believe (G4100 *pisteuo*) also in Me. (NASB)
#+END_QUOTE

*pisteuo* is the faith verb.

*echo* means 'to hold' - so in *Mark 11:22* Jesus says 'hold faith' in God.
And in *John 14:1* Jesus tells us to 'do faith' in God and to 'do faith' in Him.

If you are believing in Jesus, then you are obediently working.

To be justified, a person must _walk in the footsteps of the faith that our father Abraham had before he was circumcised_.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *Romans 4:9-12* - Is this blessing then only for the circumcised, or also for the uncircumcised? We say that faith was counted to Abraham as righteousness. How then was it counted to him? Was it before or after he had been circumcised? It was not after, but before he was circumcised. He received the sign of circumcision as a seal of the righteousness that he had by faith while he was still uncircumcised. The purpose was to make him the father of all who believe without being circumcised, so that righteousness would be counted to them as well, and to make him the father of the circumcised who are _not merely circumcised but who also walk in the footsteps of the faith that our father Abraham had before he was circumcised_.
#+END_QUOTE

Having faith in God *is* obeying God. Loving God *is* obeying God. AMEN!!

So what Jesus is saying is quite similar - we must have the faith that Abraham had when he put Isaac on the Altar, but in regards to following Jesus:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *Luke 9:23-24* - And he said to all, If anyone would come after me, let him deny himself and take up his cross daily and follow me. For whoever would save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for my sake will save it. (ESV)
#+END_QUOTE

Now about the following:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *Romans 4:4* - Now to the one who works, his wages are not counted as a gift but as his due.
#+END_QUOTE

I believe that what /Romans 4:4/ is saying is that before accepting God's forgiveness yourself, submitting to the righteousness of God, believing that you were in need of God's forgiveness,
anything you try to give God is simply giving God what is due to Him, and that you will never be able to return enough stolen goods to God to ever be justified. Nor would you ever be able to forgive enough other people to attain that justification.
_You ultimately need God's forgiveness_. However, forgiving others is still required if someone wants God to forgive them.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *Mark 11:25* - And whenever you stand praying, forgive, if you have anything against anyone, so that your Father also who is in heaven may forgive you your trespasses.
#+END_QUOTE

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *Matthew 6:12-15* -  and forgive us our debts, as we also have forgiven our debtors.  And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil.  For if you forgive others their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you, but if you do not forgive others their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses.  (ESV)
#+END_QUOTE

** Obedient action including seeking God in faith (trusting God's words and seeking)
I believe that obedient action which includes seeking God is an important part of faith.

I believe obedience is intrinsic to faith, actually.

True faith is always obedient; faith is always prepared to obey more:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *John 7:17*- If anyone's will is to do God's will, he will know whether the teaching is from God or whether I am speaking on my own authority.
#+END_QUOTE

Obedient action is not dead works, and I believe that obedient action is just working faith.

Being disobedient to Jesus means disbelieving in Jesus:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *John 3:36* - Whoever believes (G4100 pisteuo) in the Son has eternal life; whoever does not obey the Son shall not see life, but the wrath of God remains on him. (ESV)
#+END_QUOTE

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *Romans 4:2* - For if Abraham was justified by works, he has something to boast about, but not before God.
#+END_QUOTE

Paul doesn't deny that Abraham could have been
justified by works, but he claims that Abraham
doesn't have anything to boast about before
God. AMEN!!

Because he offered nothing to God through his work other than what was asked of him.

# God would see our obedience to Him as us having faith because God is outside of space and time.

Jesus was perfectly faithful to God by being obedient:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *Philippians 2:8* - And being found in human form, he humbled himself by becoming obedient to the point of death, even death on a cross.
#+END_QUOTE

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *Romans 9:15-16* - For he says to Moses, I will have mercy on whom I have mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I have compassion. So then it depends not on human will or exertion, but on God, who has mercy. (ESV)
#+END_QUOTE

AMEN!! But that doesn't mean human will or exertion cannot be utilised by God.

God rewards faith and may choose to reveal Himself after a while serving God in faith instead of immediately.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *Matthew 25:19* - Now after a long time the master of those servants came and settled accounts with them.
#+END_QUOTE

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *Acts 20:35* - In all things I have shown you that by working hard in this way we must help the weak and remember the words of the Lord Jesus, how he himself said, It is more *blessed to give* than to receive.
#+END_QUOTE

** Obedience belongs in faith
In God's mercy He has shown us the Way to be reconciled with Him. He has given us Jesus. He has told us what to do, and we can choose to be obedient or to not be obedient.

Jesus is the author of our faith, so having faith is grace from God, and even if works are working with our faith, it's all by grace and we still can't boast before God because our faith and our works are all gifted to us from God.

For example, Noah's works of building the ark was given to Him by God. God even outlined every detail.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *Hebrews 12:1-2* - Therefore, since we are surrounded by so great a cloud of witnesses, let us also lay aside every weight, and sin which clings so closely, and let us run with endurance the race that is set before us, looking to Jesus, the *founder* and *perfecter* of our faith, who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross, despising the shame, and is seated at the right hand of the throne of God.
#+END_QUOTE

- Obedience belongs inside faith because
  - God commanded it and complying is not really bringing anything
    to God which He hasn't told you to bring to Him.
    - So it's just acting in faith
    - If God commands you to build an ark, and you build it exactly as specified, is that considered dead works? No, it's just doing exactly what God said. It's faith.
    - If God commands you to wait 5 days before going into battle but you think 8 days would be better, thinking God needs the extra time so you can be more prepared so you wait 8 days then that is no longer faith because it's disobedience.
    - Abraham was commanded to offer Isaac as a sacrifice, and Abraham did offer Isaac out of faithful obedience.
      - *Genesis 22:2* - He said, Take your son, your only son Isaac, whom you love, and go to the land of Moriah, and offer him there as a burnt offering on one of the mountains of which I shall tell you.
      - *James 2:22* - You see that faith was active along with his works, and faith was completed by his works;
    - But if Abraham thought he could get even more rewards from God by trying the same thing again and putting Isaac on the altar again without God even commanding it, then that is like trying to justify yourself by doing dead works (i.e. deeds without faith).

  - Choosing to obey God's commandments even when no-one is watching (aside from God) is having faith in God.
    - For example, not stealing from your employer.
    - Therefore, there is a way of abiding by God's commandments which is faith and not works.
    - To not steal is to love God and have faith in God.
- Seeking God in action belongs in faith because:
  - When someone wills to do God's will, they come to know the truth
    - *John 7:17* - If anyone's will is to do God's will, he will know whether the teaching is from God or whether I am speaking on my own authority. (ESV)
  - When someone has faith, they believe that God exists and that in seeking God, God rewards them:
    - *Hebrews 11:6* - And without faith it is impossible to please him, for whoever would draw near to God must believe that he exists and that he rewards those who seek him.

Salvation is the gift, and faith implies an obedient heart. Works can be dead works when they're not done in faith. Faith is what justifies. But faith works. Faith requires obedience to God. Faithless works do not justify:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *Ephesians 2:8-9* - For by grace you have been saved through faith. And this is not your own doing; it is the gift of God, not a result of works, so that no one may boast. (ESV)
#+END_QUOTE

With an obedient heart, a person will receive revelation as they hear the teaching of Jesus.

A person must be at least willing to do His will - obedience is the essence of faith:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *John 7:17* - If anyone is willing to do His will, he will know of the teaching, whether it is of God or whether I speak from Myself.

- I believe that free grace without belief and obedience is a lie.
- I believe a heart must be both believing *and* obedient to receive the grace through faith, since I believe true faith is both obedient and believing.

After receiving justification (counted not guilty) through obedient and believing faith, we should continue in obedient and believing faith but the work we do is to be tested and is not essential to our justification:

Fear of God or love for Him in obedience or thankfulness is work which comes out of belief.

*** Just believe/obey Jesus to receive more faith and revelation and salvation
The account of Jesus itself when it's read, and Jesus' words, are enough to inspire faith. Therefore, faith comes by hearing the word of Christ.

Jesus calls persistent endurance a work. It's also required to keep our confidence:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *Hebrews 10:35-36*- Therefore do not throw away your confidence, which has a great reward. For _you have need of endurance, so that when you have done the will of God you may receive what is promised._
#+END_QUOTE

Faith is like Peter stepping out on the water. Faith works. But I think sometimes to create faith someone just has to actually believe Jesus because Jesus performs the miracle / the work.

The LORD did something similar for the Israelites when He parted the Red Sea.
The Israelites obeyed God, and their obedience led them to sure belief.
Obedience, belief and trust are all important in faith.

Revelation comes as we do what God commands us:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *John 7:17* - If anyone's will is to do God's will, he will know whether the teaching is from God or whether I am speaking on my own authority. (ESV)

  *Exodus 14:21-30* - Then Moses stretched out his hand over the sea, and the Lord drove the sea back by a strong east wind all night and made the sea dry land, and the waters were divided. And the people of Israel went into the midst of the sea on dry ground, the waters being a wall to them on their right hand and on their left. The Egyptians pursued and went in after them into the midst of the sea, all Pharaoh's horses, his chariots, and his horsemen. And in the morning watch the Lord in the pillar of fire and of cloud looked down on the Egyptian forces and threw the Egyptian forces into a panic, clogging their chariot wheels so that they drove heavily. And the Egyptians said, Let us flee from before Israel, for the Lord fights for them against the Egyptians. Then the Lord said to Moses, Stretch out your hand over the sea, that the water may come back upon the Egyptians, upon their chariots, and upon their horsemen. So Moses stretched out his hand over the sea, and the sea returned to its normal course when the morning appeared. And as the Egyptians fled into it, the Lord threw the Egyptians into the midst of the sea. The waters returned and covered the chariots and the horsemen; of all the host of Pharaoh that had followed them into the sea, not one of them remained. But the people of Israel walked on dry ground through the sea, the waters being a wall to them on their right hand and on their left. Thus the Lord saved Israel that day from the hand of the Egyptians, and Israel saw the Egyptians dead on the seashore.

Salvation is the gift, and faith implies an obedient heart. Works can be dead works when they're not done in faith. Faith is what justifies. But faith works. Faith requires obedience to God. Faithless works do not justify:

**** The obedience of faith

A person must be at least willing to do His will - obedience is the essence of faith:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *John 7:17* - If anyone is willing to do His will, he will know of the teaching, whether it is of God or whether I speak from Myself.
#+END_QUOTE

I think *Ephesians 2:8-9* when it says 'through faith' doesn't actually exclude obedience (obeying Jesus), because I think obedience is intrinsic to faith.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *Exodus 14:14-16* - The Lord will fight for you, and you have only to be silent.  The Lord said to Moses, Why do you cry to me? Tell the people of Israel to go forward.

#+END_QUOTE

When it says "not a result of works", I believe that something more like, even if works were tied into the faith, it's by grace. If a person's saving faith included works then that is fine.

Faith-in-God is hearing God's word and believing it, and even acting on it, or at least the readiness to act on it.
A person may act on faith in their heart by arriving at conviction. But it has to be faith in the truth.
Then, like Peter stepping out on the water, or like the woman at the well going in to town to tell people about Jesus, or turning from sinful things, it produces more obedience.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *Matthew 14:27-32* - But immediately Jesus spoke to them, saying, Take heart; it is I. Do not be afraid. And Peter answered him, Lord, if it is you, *command* me to come to you on the water. He said, Come. So Peter *got out of the boat and walked on the water and came to Jesus*. But when he saw the wind, he was afraid, and beginning to sink he cried out, Lord, save me. Jesus immediately reached out his hand and took hold of him, saying to him, O you of little faith, why did you doubt? And when they got into the boat, the wind ceased.
#+END_QUOTE

And there is an amount of faith, and true belief is all that's required to be saved, but Faith is so tightly linked to Obedience like Faith is linked to Hope. True belief is enough because it accepts what Jesus says, as a child believes. But I don't think this discounts that the same faith continues and increases through obedience.

Some people never seem to arrive:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *II Timothy 3:6-9* - For among them are those who creep into households and capture weak women, burdened with sins and led astray by various passions, always learning and _never able to arrive at a knowledge of the truth_. Just as Jannes and Jambres opposed Moses, so these _men also oppose the truth, men corrupted in mind and disqualified regarding the faith_. But they will not get very far, for their folly will be plain to all, as was that of those two men.
#+END_QUOTE

But the ones who do arrive actually _follow the teaching_:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *II Timothy 3:10-13* - You, however, have _followed my teaching, my conduct, my aim in life, my faith, my patience, my love, my steadfastness, my persecutions and sufferings that happened to me_ at Antioch, at Iconium, and at Lystra—which persecutions I endured; yet from them all the Lord rescued me. Indeed, all who desire to live a godly life in Christ Jesus will be persecuted, while evil people and impostors will go on from bad to worse, deceiving and being deceived.
#+END_QUOTE

Peter demonstrated obedience. A changed heart is essential to be saved, I think, because it must produce more obedience.

  Obedience = Submitting to the Righteousness of God * Turning from sin, loving, showing mercy, etc.

The true knowledge of Jesus grants us everything pertaining to life and godliness, allowing us to partake in the divine nature. We should then reinforce the divine nature with such things:

Faith has 'substance/magnitude' and may be described as a vector:
- The origin of hope/belief is represented by the point.
  - On the Faith plane, positive magnitude comes from trust in God
- Hope-from/in-God is the direction.
- Work/Love/Obedience is the magnitude.

I want to be clear, having faith in Jesus Christ is not dead faith.
Dead faith is precisely not having faith in Jesus Christ.

An obedient heart is required for it to not be 'dead faith'.

Do you not know that if you present yourselves to anyone as obedient slaves, you are slaves of the one whom you obey, either of sin, which leads to death, or of *obedience, which leads to righteousness*?  But thanks be to God, that you who were once slaves of sin have become *obedient from the heart to the standard of teaching to which you were committed*, and, having been set free from sin, have become *slaves of righteousness*.  I am speaking in human terms, because of your natural limitations. For just as you once presented your members as slaves to impurity and to lawlessness leading to more lawlessness, so now present your members as slaves to righteousness leading to sanctification.  When you were slaves of sin, you were free in regard to righteousness.  But what fruit were you getting at that time from the things of which you are now ashamed? The end of those things is death.  But now that you have been _set free from sin and have become slaves of God, the fruit you get leads to sanctification and its end, eternal life.

But now the righteousness of God has been manifested apart from the law, although the Law and the Prophets bear witness to it— the righteousness of God through faith in Jesus Christ for all who believe. For there is no distinction: for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God, and are justified by his grace as a gift, through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus, whom God put forward as a propitiation by his blood, *to be received by faith*. This was to show God's righteousness, because in his divine forbearance he had passed over former sins. It was to show his righteousness at the present time, so that he might be just and the justifier of the one who has faith in Jesus. Then what becomes of our boasting? It is excluded. By what kind of law? By a law of works? No, but by the law of faith.

And Jesus said, You shall not murder, You shall not commit adultery, You shall not steal, You shall not bear false witness, Honor your father and mother, and, You shall love your neighbor as yourself. The young man said to him, All these I have kept. What do I still lack? Jesus said to him, If you would be perfect, go, sell what you possess and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; and come, follow me. When the young man heard this he went away sorrowful, for he had great possessions. And Jesus said to his disciples, Truly, I say to you, only with difficulty will a rich person enter the kingdom of heaven. Again I tell you, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich person to enter the kingdom of God. When the disciples heard this, they were greatly astonished, saying, Who then can be saved? But Jesus looked at them and said, With man this is impossible, but with God all things are possible.

It's necessary to submit to the righteousness of God:
- You have accepted that you needed forgiveness from God.
- You have accepted that it's through the shedding of the blood of Jesus Christ that God has forgiven you, forgiving a debt which was impossible for you to pay.
- Forgive others freely, knowing you've been forgiven of your sin. Give freely. Forgive the debt of others towards you. That looks like being a scapegoat and letting oneself be fleeced. Imagine you've just been born-again but noone else knows. You know you must forgive others. You know God can see your heart. Now all of a sudden people make these claims that you owe them X, Y and Z. You know you've been forgiven of a debt you were not able to pay. Now instead of contesting others on whether or not you owe them, you give freely. Seventy-times-seven.

Self-righteous forgiveness:
- Conditional forgiveness (not freely)
- Self-righteously forgive others as if you're perfectly innocent and of course they sinned against innocence by sinning against you
- Without accepting that you needed the forgiveness which Jesus has paid through His blood, you then forgive others
  - This tries to establish one's own righteousness without submitting to the righteousness of God
- Believing that you're already good with God and never needed Jesus
  - not prepared to forgive freely
  - but not having yet submitted to the fact that you need forgiveness from God.
  - Forgiving others is good to do, but without having truly accepted that you needed forgiveness yourself, you'd still be forgiving others out of debt to God.
  - I think it's impossible to have Christ's heart without having first accepted being forgiven by Jesus
- Do not accept that one needs or ever needed forgiveness from God.
  - That actually means that person's forgiveness is at least a bit self-righteous (at least from God's perspective)
    - They do not give out of credit, but while indebted to God, they still give God what is due by forgiving others their offenses towards them
      - nevertheless, a person can never achieve perfect right standing with God without submitting to the righteousness of God through faith in Christ and accepting the atonement which Jesus has purchased through His blood

Then he who is physically uncircumcised but keeps the law will condemn you who have the written code and circumcision but break the law.

* Mosaic Law, and progressing from having hope in Moses to having hope in Jesus
I enjoyed this video, but I still am of the opinion that keeping the law is not necessary, (but not prohibited, so long as it is pursued by faith and submitting to God's righteousness):
- [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNHKqhwu6Bo][Public Debate - Should Christians Keep The Law? - YouTube]]
- The law is good and just and Jesus both obeyed it flawlessly, but He also fulfilled it like a prophesy.

I read the following as, as we have faith in Jesus, following Him, where we have fallen short, Jesus has covered us, but we still try to live righteously. We still live with faith in God.

And when we continue to sin, Jesus is our High Priest and Advocate, and covers us, as we continue to have faith in Him.

The 10 Commandments and the 2 Great commandments are special because when followed from the heart they show people how to love God and one's neighbour.

And we are _commanded_ (even as Christians not _under the law_) to love our neighbours:

The rest of the Mosaic law is still useful for training in righteousness. It shows people how to live in obedience to God and in love for God and one's neighbour. But we are not under the Mosaic law, but we are under the law of Christ. We have faith in Christ.

We can pursue the righteousness that is through faith (G4100 *pisteuo*) in Jesus Christ.

But thanks be to God, that you who were once slaves of sin have become obedient from the heart to the standard of teaching to which you were committed, and, having been set free from sin, have become *slaves of righteousness*.  I am speaking in human terms, because of your natural limitations. For just as you once presented your members as slaves to impurity and to lawlessness leading to more lawlessness, so now present your members as *slaves to righteousness leading to sanctification*.  When you were slaves of sin, you were free in regard to righteousness.  But what fruit were you getting at that time from the things of which you are now ashamed? The end of those things is death.  But now that you have been *set free from sin and have become slaves of God, the fruit you get leads to sanctification and its end, eternal life*.

*** Jesus' commandments don't contradict the rest of the commandments
Also God's commandments (especially the 10 Commandments; loving God and your neighbour) are still binding on us - written on our heart when we get born-again and after being born-again we follow them in Spirit, but they don't bind on us in a way that condemns us if we  break them, but we *want* to follow them.

Jesus fulfilled the law => We have the Spirit of Christ => We are led by the Spirit and naturally want to follow the law in faith but the world opposes us because when a person actually follows the commandments, they do not lie, do not commit adultery, do not commit idolatry, etc. and that means a person can be 'taken advantage of' by unfaithful people who do not obey God's commandments but exploit others who follow God.

But we neither pursue the law by works, nor seek it to be justified.

There's no contradiction between what the 10 commandments say and loving one's neighbour, i.e. for the way in which we must live entering into life.

*** However, we must submit to God's righteousness through faith in Jesus Christ - this is what saves
It's not with the mind that a person believes, but with the heart:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *Romans 10:6-13* - But the righteousness based on faith says, Do not say in your heart, Who will ascend into heaven? (that is, to bring Christ down) or Who will descend into the abyss? (that is, to bring Christ up from the dead).  But what does it say? The word is near you, in your mouth and in your heart (that is, the word of faith that we proclaim); because, if you confess with your mouth that Jesus is Lord and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved.  For *with the heart one believes (G4100 pisteuo) and is justified*, and with the mouth one confesses and is saved.  For the Scripture says, Everyone who believes in him will not be put to shame.  For there is no distinction between Jew and Greek; the same Lord is Lord of all, bestowing his riches on all who call on him.  For everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved.
#+END_QUOTE

But what does it take for the _heart_ to truly believe? Because that's the condition. When the heart truly believes, a person is obedient.

More obedience may still need to take place for that individual to arrive at justifying faith, and God may be allowing you to come to your faith.

To be justified, a person must _walk in the footsteps of the faith that our father Abraham had before he was circumcised_.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *Romans 4:9-12* - Is this blessing then only for the circumcised, or also for the uncircumcised? We say that faith was counted to Abraham as righteousness. How then was it counted to him? Was it before or after he had been circumcised? It was not after, but before he was circumcised. He received the sign of circumcision as a seal of the righteousness that he had by faith while he was still uncircumcised. The purpose was to make him the father of all who believe without being circumcised, so that righteousness would be counted to them as well, and to make him the father of the circumcised who are _not merely circumcised but who also walk in the footsteps of the faith that our father Abraham had before he was circumcised_.
#+END_QUOTE

It does say '*you will be saved*', not '*you are saved*'.

And the word *confess* I think means to admit with repentance - an admission of guilt to God and change of mind resulting in confessing that Jesus is Lord and that God indeed raised Him from the dead, and that you needed Him to do so, because His name means Jesus (The LORD Saves), Christ (Annointed Messiah, Saviour), Son of God.

If a person confesses this truthfully, they professes that they submit to the righteousness of God.

That's a little bit loaded. It results in a heart growing in obedience towards God.
And I believe it's the resulting obedience to God that ends up saving that person, even if that obedience hasn't produced any work yet other than belief. God is the one that saves and justifies.

Then Jesus hits us with this:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE

  *Ephesians 1:4* - even as he chose us in him before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy and blameless before him. In love

So while we might think we have done something, God had planned it in advance, and the entire thing is grace - but that doesn't mean from our perspective it does not look like we need to obey God - because we still need to have faith and do something. And if we don't do anything then we are asking God to do it for us.

Since the Bible does not teach that all people will be saved because they remain disobedient, I think we should teach people that they should do something; That they should repent from sin and they should repent from unbelief if they want to be saved from sin and leading to death, and if they want to enter into the light of the truth, and enter into a relationship with God.

The root of disobedience/rebellion is unbelief/denial.

The righteousness we have through faith in Jesus Christ is needed whether someone keeps the Mosaic law or not.

Not that I keep the Mosaic law in its entirety, nor are circumcised. But I try to keep the Great commandments
and the 10 Commandments out of faith (and a relationship with God) and follow parts of the Mosaic law,
but I have faith in Jesus Christ for the righteousness that comes through faith because I need that because my own
righteousness will never be enough without faith in Jesus for God's righteousness imputed to me.

- Who gave Moses the law and the instructions to build the tabernacle? God did.
  - The blueprints came from God.
- The Law, the Psalms and the Prophets all point to Jesus.
- Moses wrote about Jesus.
- Jesus fulfilled the Law and the prophecies.

We still follow the law but by faith and not by works.

We keep accountability with God, and in truth over following the law - God knows when we lie, cheat, commit adultery, idolise etc.
We follow the law in truth.
Jesus fulfilled the law. Jesus' blood is the atonement for sin.
So we go to Jesus for forgiveness instead of perform the ceremonial law to try to make atonement for sin.

The repentant sinner feared God and put his hope on Jesus Christ, not to save him from the cross, but to save his soul:

#+END_QUOTE

A _key thing_ here is that the repentant sinner didn't value his present life, and didn't care to ask Jesus to save his present life on earth. The repentant sinner had come to the end of caring about his present life, and put his trust in Jesus. This is what we should do, and it looks like sacrificing the present life to follow Jesus. And I believe that to someone who isn't literally at the end of their earthly life that looks like repentance from sin and an obedient heart, serving Jesus. You can see that he had a _changed heart_, and was remorseful. He knew he was being justly punished. And he had the heart to want to follow Jesus.

While Jesus can save someone from dying, I think eternal life the way it's presented is more than that - it's becoming a part of the Truth - it's union with Christ and with God.

#+END_QUOTE

James isn't talking about work of the law, he's talking about the works of faith.

God desires us to have mercy.

There are a lot of 'do nots' in the law but the most important thing is the 2 'do' commandments.
The 'do nots' are to stop people from doing bad things, but the 2 Greatest commandments command us to love God and our neighbour.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *Matthew 22:37-40* - And he said to him, You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind. This is the great and first commandment.

  *James 2:13-17* - For judgment is without mercy to one who has shown no mercy. Mercy triumphs over judgment. What good is it, my brothers, if someone says he has faith but does not have works? Can that faith save him? If a brother or sister is poorly clothed and lacking in daily food, and one of you says to them, Go in peace, be warmed and filled, without giving them the things needed for the body, what good is that? So also faith by itself, if it does not have works, is dead.

Or have you not read in the Law how on the Sabbath the priests in the temple profane the Sabbath and are guiltless? I tell you, something greater than the temple is here. And if you had known what this means, I desire mercy, and not sacrifice, you would not have condemned the guiltless. For the Son of Man is lord of the Sabbath.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *II Thessalonians 2:10-13* - and with all the deception of wickedness for those who perish, because they did not receive the love of the truth so as to be saved. For this reason God will send upon them a deluding influence so that they will believe what is false, in order that they all may be judged who did not believe the truth, but took pleasure in wickedness. But we should always give thanks to God for you, brethren beloved by the Lord, because God has chosen you from the beginning for _salvation through sanctification by the Spirit and faith in the truth_.
#+END_QUOTE

The Spirit sanctifies as we have faith in the truth.
The faith in the truth is the cooperative part, where we obey the truth.

** Working faith / faith with substance

Faith is a relationship with God. God has promised inheriting the Kingdom, inheriting eternal life to those who obey Him. But God is sovereign to save.

I made these equations to describe my understanding that faith is actually closely related to belief, obedience, hope and love, and they actually are not completely separate things.

#+BEGIN_SRC text -n :async :results verbatim code :lang text
  Faith-in-God = Hope-from/in-God * Work/Love

  Hope-from/in-God = Belief(believing God) * Truth(God's word is truth)

  Work/Love = Obedience * Faithfulness * Fear-of-God * Response-of-love-to-Jesus * Patient-Endurance(time)

  Obedience = Submitting to the Righteousness of God * Turning from sin, loving, showing mercy, etc.

  Fear-of-God = e.g. The poor in spirit recognise their need of God's mercy and tremble at His Word: "beat his breast, saying, God, be merciful to me, a sinner!"

  Response-of-love-to-Jesus = e.g. praise, thankfulness, obeying His commandments

  Love is proportional-to the baggage which has been forgiven
  Love ∝ forgiven-baggage

  Obedience ∝ Love

  F = H * L

  Faith-in-God when tested by God is found to be true Faith in God.
  Faith-in-God must submit to the Righteousness of God through faith in Jesus Christ,
  Jesus Christ having paid the price of sin, enabling a relationship with God.

Then I said, Behold, I have come to do your will, O God, as it is written of me in the scroll of the book. When he said above, You have _neither desired nor taken pleasure in sacrifices and offerings and burnt offerings and sin offerings_ (_these are offered according to the law_), then he added, Behold, I have come to do your will. He abolishes the first in order to establish the second. And by that will we have been sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all. And every priest stands daily at his service, offering repeatedly the same sacrifices, which can never take away sins. right hand of God, waiting from that time until his enemies should be made a footstool for his feet. For by a single offering he has perfected for all time those who are being sanctified.

And Jesus said, You shall not murder, You shall not commit adultery, You shall not steal, You shall not bear false witness, Honor your father and mother, and, You shall love your neighbor as yourself.

When the young man heard this he went away sorrowful, for he had great possessions. And Jesus said to his disciples, Truly, I say to you, only with difficulty will a rich person enter the kingdom of heaven.

Whoever feeds on this bread will live forever. Jesus said these things in the synagogue, as he taught at Capernaum. When many of his disciples heard it, they said, This is a hard saying; who can listen to it? But Jesus, knowing in himself that his disciples were grumbling about this, said to them, Do you take offense at this? Then what if you were to see the Son of Man ascending to where he was before? It is the Spirit who gives life; the flesh is of no avail. The words that I have spoken to you are spirit and life. But there are some of you who do not believe.

Again he sent other servants, more than the first. And they did the same to them. Finally he sent his son to them, saying, They will respect my son. But when the tenants saw the son, they said to themselves, This is the heir. Come, let us kill him and have his inheritance. And they took him and threw him out of the vineyard and killed him. When therefore the owner of the vineyard comes, what will he do to those tenants? They said to him, He will put those wretches to a miserable death and let out the vineyard to other tenants who will give him the fruits in their seasons.

You made him for a little while lower than the angels; you have crowned him with glory and honor, putting everything in subjection under his feet.

But when it says, all things are put in subjection, it is plain that he is excepted who put all things in subjection under him. When all things are subjected to him, then the Son himself will also be subjected to him who put all things in subjection under him, that God may be all in all.

So _the honor is for you who believe_, but for those who do not believe, The stone that the builders rejected has become the cornerstone, and A stone of stumbling, and a rock of offense. They stumble because they disobey the word, as they were destined to do. But you are a chosen race, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people for his own possession, that you may proclaim the excellencies of him who called you out of darkness into his marvelous light. Once you were not a people, but now you are God's people; once you had not received mercy, but now you have received mercy. Beloved, I urge you as sojourners and exiles to abstain from the passions of the flesh, which wage war against your soul. Keep your conduct among the Gentiles honorable, so that when they speak against you as evildoers, they may see your good deeds and glorify God on the day of visitation. Be subject for the Lord's sake to every human institution, whether it be to the emperor as supreme, or to governors as sent by him to punish those who do evil and to praise those who do good. For this is the will of God, that by doing good you should put to silence the ignorance of foolish people. Live as people who are free, not using your freedom as a cover-up for evil, but living as servants of God. Honor everyone. Love the brotherhood. Fear God. Honor the emperor. Servants, be subject to your masters with all respect, not only to the good and gentle but also to the unjust. For this is a gracious thing, when, mindful of God, one endures sorrows while suffering unjustly. For what credit is it if, when you sin and are beaten for it, you endure? But if when you do good and suffer for it you endure, this is a gracious thing in the sight of God. For to this you have been called, because Christ also suffered for you, leaving you an example, so that you might follow in his steps. He committed no sin, neither was deceit found in his mouth. When he was reviled, he did not revile in return; when he suffered, he did not threaten, but continued entrusting himself to him who judges justly. He himself bore our sins in his body on the tree, that we might die to sin and live to righteousness. By his wounds you have been healed. For you were straying like sheep, but have now returned to the Shepherd and Overseer of your souls.

But at midnight there was a cry, Here is the bridegroom! Come out to meet him. Then all those virgins rose and trimmed their lamps. And the foolish said to the wise, Give us some of your oil, for our lamps are going out. But the wise answered, saying, Since there will not be enough for us and for you, go rather to the dealers and buy for yourselves. And while they were going to buy, the bridegroom came, and those who were ready went in with him to the marriage feast, and the door was shut. Afterward the other virgins came also, saying, Lord, lord, open to us. But he answered, Truly, I say to you, I do not know you. Watch therefore, for you know neither the day nor the hour.

To one he gave five talents, to another two, to another one, to each according to his ability. Then he went away. He who had received the five talents went at once and traded with them, and he made five talents more. So also he who had the two talents made two talents more. But he who had received the one talent went and dug in the ground and hid his master's money. Now after a long time the master of those servants came and settled accounts with them. And he who had received the five talents came forward, bringing five talents more, saying, Master, you delivered to me five talents; here I have made five talents more. His master said to him, *Well done, good and faithful servant. You have been faithful over a little; I will set you over much*. Enter into the joy of your master. And he also who had the two talents came forward, saying, Master, you delivered to me two talents; here I have made two talents more. His master said to him, Well done, good and faithful servant. You have been faithful over a little; I will set you over much. Enter into the joy of your master. He also who had received the one talent came forward, saying, Master, I knew you to be a hard man, reaping where you did not sow, and gathering where you scattered no seed, so I was afraid, and I went and hid your talent in the ground. Here you have what is yours. But his master answered him, You wicked and slothful servant! You knew that I reap where I have not sowed and gather where I scattered no seed? Then you ought to have invested my money with the bankers, and at my coming I should have received what was my own with interest. So take the talent from him and give it to him who has the ten talents. *For to everyone who has will more be given, and he will have an abundance. But from the one who has not, even what he has will be taken away. And cast the worthless servant into the outer darkness*. In that place there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth. (ESV)

And he will place the sheep on his right, but the goats on the left.

God spoke to Abram first, and then Abram *obeyed*.
Abraham was faithful.
God noticed Abram's faithfulness, and told Abram he would be rewarded.
God gave Abram a promise.
Abram believed God.

But God made the first move.
The first move from Abraham's perspective was obedience, followed by belief.

The Lord God spoke first - this itself is a gift. We have the Bible and the testimony of others as a gift from God.
We must then believe what is said in the Holy Scriptures and trust it and obey it (put into practice).

Faith eclipses the law:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *Romans 4:9-12* - Is this blessing then only for the circumcised, or also for the uncircumcised? We say that faith was counted to Abraham as righteousness. How then was it counted to him? Was it before or after he had been circumcised? It was not after, but before he was circumcised. He received the sign of circumcision as a seal of the righteousness that he had by faith while he was still uncircumcised. The purpose was to make him the father of all who believe without being circumcised, so that righteousness would be counted to them as well, and to make him the father of the circumcised who are _not merely circumcised but who also walk in the footsteps of the faith that our father Abraham had before he was circumcised_.

The ones under the law who also walk in the footsteps of the faith that Abraham had before he was circumcised, come under the umbrella of the faith of Abraham, which the Gentiles who also share the faith of Abraham are included within.

But before and/or after believing and being forgiven a person needs to also turn away from sin.
To be '*saved*' I think means:
- for God to forgive one's sins through Jesus Christ, and
- for that person to be progressing towards holiness and not away from holiness - towards sanctification and ultimately, eternal life
 - the Holy Spirit helps a person to do that
- to be eagerly waiting for Jesus to save them

I am speaking in human terms, because of your natural limitations. For just as you once presented your members as slaves to impurity and to lawlessness leading to more lawlessness, so now present your members as slaves to righteousness leading to sanctification. When you were slaves of sin, you were free in regard to righteousness. But what fruit were you getting at that time from the things of which you are now ashamed? The end of those things is death. But now that you have been set free from sin and have become slaves of God, the fruit you get leads to sanctification and its end, *eternal life*. (ESV)

I think faith is like casting a net to receive something.

If you want to catch something big then you need a lot of faith.

Faith receives salvation, and salvation is the gift which is received through faith.
Faith is something which a person must have to receive the free gift.
The onus is on us to receive the free gift.

We must approach Jesus.
We must repent (change our minds, turning from our wicked ways, and turn to God) and obey God.
God has said many things, about his statutes and about how we should listen to Jesus.
I think repentance (from the heart turning from sin) is still approaching Jesus because Jesus fulfilled the law.

Humble yourself and obey God's commandments (not out of pride, but out of authentic faith with God, being accountable to God, in secret).

For example, abstaining from partaking in stealing, or adultery and being faithful to God, even if you lose friends over it.
This type of obeying God's commandments is nothing to do with pride or self-exultation or self-righteousness and everything to do with being faithful to God and humbling oneself to God.

Trying to turn from sin in truth and reality.

Work substantiates faith because it is the act of receiving from God.

A work of faith could indeed be following the law in faith (as opposed to following the law by works).

For example, keeping your integrity, remaining faithful to God and not lying to God.

Patient endurance is a 'work of faith'.

* The Kingdom of God
After I got born-again I started getting dreams with themes of the 'Kingdom of God', and also through interactions I began having with people, while I was pursuing following Jesus' commandments, etc. So my 'evidence' is a personal conviction that comes through faith in Jesus which has been working.

That's how I interpret how the following passage says that the Kingdom of God is not coming with signs to be observed:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *Luke 17:20-21* - Being asked by the Pharisees when the kingdom of God would come, he answered them, The kingdom of God is not coming with signs to be observed, nor will they say, Look, here it is! or There! for behold, the _kingdom of God is in the midst of you._
#+END_QUOTE

* Entering and inheriting the kingdom
There's so much stuff to do to enter the kingdom... I feel entirely unworthy.

Firstly, it has been by grace because I asked God to save me, even when I was very much stuck in sin. And I still _feel_ as though I am approaching it and haven't quite entered it (just being honest here).

Those who hunger and thirst for righteousness will be satisfied.

Please God, give me the righteousness required to enter the kingdom.

Then he will answer them, saying, Truly, I say to you, as you did not do it to one of the least of these, you did not do it to me. And these will go away into eternal punishment, but the righteous into eternal life.

When once the master of the house has risen and shut the door, and you begin to stand outside and to knock at the door, saying, Lord, open to us, then he will answer you, I do not know where you come from. Then you will begin to say, We ate and drank in your presence, and you taught in our streets. But he will say, I tell you, I do not know where you come from. Depart from me, all you workers of evil!

But when he heard these things, he became very sad, for he was extremely rich. Jesus, looking at him with sadness, said, How difficult it is for those who have wealth to enter the kingdom of God!

For out of Zion shall go forth the law, and the word of the LORD from Jerusalem. He shall judge between many peoples, and shall decide for strong nations afar off; and they shall beat their swords into plowshares, and their spears into pruning hooks; nation shall not lift up sword against nation, neither shall they learn war anymore; but they shall sit every man under his vine and under his fig tree, and no one shall make them afraid, for the mouth of the LORD of hosts has spoken. For all the peoples walk each in the name of its god, but we will walk in the name of the LORD our God forever and ever. In that day, declares the LORD, I will assemble the lame and gather those who have been driven away and those whom I have afflicted; and the lame I will make the remnant, and those who were cast off, a strong nation; and the LORD will reign over them in Mount Zion from this time forth and forevermore. And you, O tower of the flock, hill of the daughter of Zion, to you shall it come, the former dominion shall come, kingship for the daughter of Jerusalem. Now why do you cry aloud? Is there no king in you? Has your counselor perished, that pain seized you like a woman in labor? Writhe and groan, O daughter of Zion, like a woman in labor, for now you shall go out from the city and dwell in the open country; you shall go to Babylon. There you shall be rescued; there the LORD will redeem you from the hand of your enemies. Now many nations are assembled against you, saying, Let her be defiled, and let our eyes gaze upon Zion. But they do not know the thoughts of the LORD; they do not understand his plan, that he has gathered them as sheaves to the threshing floor. Arise and thresh, O daughter of Zion, for I will make your horn iron, and I will make your hoofs bronze; you shall beat in pieces many peoples; and shall devote their gain to the LORD, their wealth to the Lord of the whole earth.

The cup of blessing that we bless, is it not a participation in the blood of Christ? The bread that we break, is it not a participation in the body of Christ? Because there is one bread, we who are many are one body, for we all partake of the one bread. Consider the people of Israel: are not those who eat the sacrifices participants in the altar? What do I imply then? That food offered to idols is anything, or that an idol is anything? No, I imply that what pagans sacrifice they offer to demons and not to God. I do not want you to be participants with demons. *You cannot drink the cup of the Lord and the cup of demons. You cannot partake of the table of the Lord and the table of demons*. Shall we provoke the Lord to jealousy? Are we stronger than he? All things are lawful, but not all things are helpful. All things are lawful, but not all things build up. Let no one seek his own good, but the good of his neighbor. Eat whatever is sold in the meat market without raising any question on the ground of conscience. For the earth is the Lord's, and the fullness thereof. If one of the unbelievers invites you to dinner and you are disposed to go, eat whatever is set before you without raising any question on the ground of conscience. But if someone says to you, This has been offered in sacrifice, then do not eat it, for the sake of the one who informed you, and for the sake of conscience— I do not mean your conscience, but his. For why should my liberty be determined by someone else's conscience? If I partake with thankfulness, why am I denounced because of that for which I give thanks? So, whether you eat or drink, or whatever you do, do all to the glory of God.

This is the design:

  *Genesis 2:22-24* - And the rib that the Lord God had taken from the man he made into a woman and brought her to the man. Then the man said, This at last is bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh; she shall be called Woman, because she was taken out of Man. Therefore a man shall leave his father and his mother and hold fast to his wife, and they shall become one flesh. (ESV)

Jesus is in agreement with God's design:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *Matthew 19:3-9* - And Pharisees came up to him and tested him by asking, Is it lawful to divorce one's wife for any cause? He answered, Have you not read that he who created them from the beginning made them male and female, and said, Therefore a man shall leave his father and his mother and hold fast to his wife, and they shall become one flesh? So they are no longer two but one flesh. What therefore God has joined together, let not man separate. They said to him, Why then did Moses command one to give a certificate of divorce and to send her away? He said to them, Because of your hardness of heart Moses allowed you to divorce your wives, but from the beginning it was not so. And I say to you: whoever divorces his wife, except for sexual immorality, and marries another, commits adultery. (ESV)

For _everything created by God is good, and nothing is to be rejected if it is received with thanksgiving, for it is made holy by the word of God and prayer._ If you put these things before the brothers, you will be a good servant of Christ Jesus, being trained in the words of the faith and of the good doctrine that you have followed. Have nothing to do with irreverent, silly myths. Rather train yourself for godliness; for while bodily training is of some value, godliness is of value in every way, as it holds promise for the present life and also for the life to come. (ESV)

Husbands, love your wives, as Christ loved the church and gave himself up for her, that he might sanctify her, having cleansed her by the washing of water with the word, so that he might present the church to himself in splendor, without spot or wrinkle or any such thing, that she might be holy and without blemish. In the same way husbands should love their wives as their own bodies. He who loves his wife loves himself. For no one ever hated his own flesh, but nourishes and cherishes it, just as Christ does the church, because we are members of his body. Therefore a man shall leave his father and mother and hold fast to his wife, and the two shall become one flesh. This mystery is profound, and I am saying that it refers to Christ and the church.

And when the sun rose it was scorched, and since it had no root, it withered away.  Other seed fell among thorns, and the thorns grew up and choked it, and it yielded no grain.  And other seeds fell into good soil and produced grain, growing up and increasing and yielding thirtyfold and sixtyfold and a hundredfold.  And he said, He who has ears to hear, let him hear.  And when he was alone, those around him with the twelve asked him about the parables.  And he said to them, To you has been given the secret of the kingdom of God, but for those outside everything is in parables, so that they may indeed see but not perceive, and may indeed hear but not understand, lest they should turn and be forgiven.  And he said to them, Do you not understand this parable? How then will you understand all the parables?  The sower sows the word.  And these are the ones along the path, where the word is sown: when they hear, Satan immediately comes and takes away the word that is sown in them.  And these are the ones sown on rocky ground: the ones who, when they hear the word, immediately receive it with joy.  And they have no root in themselves, but endure for a while; then, when tribulation or persecution arises on account of the word, immediately they fall away.  And others are the ones sown among thorns. They are those who hear the word, but the cares of the world and the deceitfulness of riches and the desires for other things enter in and choke the word, and it proves unfruitful.  But those that were sown on the *good soil* are *the ones who hear the word and accept it and bear fruit*, thirtyfold and sixtyfold and a hundredfold.

Good soil:

- Accepts the word
- Bears fruit

The word is spoken to us and we must receive it and nurture it and produce fruit:

Believing is just the starting point. This is honestly just the starting point. Obedience is *expected*. Also, Jesus is forgiving, unlike the angel.

Continuing to trust in Jesus as the Messiah, your Saviour, and the Only-begotten Son of God through patient endurance is enough to get saved, I think, but it's not enough to be counted a 'disciple' of Jesus.

And it's 'saved' but 'being saved' at the same time.

One wants to progress from 'believing that' to having Jesus abide inside them.

I think that rejects His commandments but claiming to believe in Jesus Christ as the Son of God is an extremely precarious, and tentative position to be in,
and may indicate that the person doesn't *really* believe.

And if a person doesn't believe in reality, then that person probably isn't saved - so they are only lying to themself that they are saved.

And Jesus said to his disciples, Truly, I say to you, only with difficulty will a rich person enter the kingdom of heaven. Again I tell you, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich person to enter the kingdom of God. When the disciples heard this, they were greatly astonished, saying, Who then can be saved? But Jesus looked at them and said, With man this is impossible, but with God all things are possible. Then Peter said in reply, See, we have left everything and followed you. What then will we have? Jesus said to them, Truly, I say to you, in the new world, when the Son of Man will sit on his glorious throne, you who have followed me will also sit on twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel. And everyone who has left houses or brothers or sisters or father or mother or children or lands, for my name's sake, will receive a hundredfold and will inherit eternal life.

And the manager said to himself, What shall I do, since my master is taking the management away from me? I am not strong enough to dig, and I am ashamed to beg. I have decided what to do, so that when I am removed from management, people may receive me into their houses. So, summoning his master's debtors one by one, he said to the first, How much do you owe my master? He said, A hundred measures of oil. He said to him, Take your bill, and sit down quickly and write fifty. Then he said to another, And how much do you owe? He said, A hundred measures of wheat. He said to him, Take your bill, and write eighty. The master commended the dishonest manager for his shrewdness.

All that the Father gives me will come to me, and whoever comes to me I will never cast out. For I have come down from heaven, not to do my own will but the will of him who sent me. And this is the will of him who sent me, that I should lose nothing of all that he has given me, but raise it up on the last day.

  *Romans 11:15-32* - For if their rejection means the reconciliation of the world, what will their acceptance mean but life from the dead? If the dough offered as firstfruits is holy, so is the whole lump, and if the root is holy, so are the branches. But if some of the branches were broken off, and you, although a wild olive shoot, were grafted in among the others and now share in the nourishing root of the olive tree, do not be arrogant toward the branches. If you are, remember it is not you who support the root, but the root that supports you. Then you will say, Branches were broken off so that I might be grafted in. That is true. They were broken off because of their unbelief, but you stand fast through faith. So do not become proud, but stand in awe. For if God did not spare the natural branches, neither will he spare you. Note then the kindness and the severity of God: severity toward those who have fallen, but God's kindness to you, provided you continue in his kindness. Otherwise you too will be cut off. And even they, if they do not continue in their unbelief, will be grafted in, for God has the power to graft them in again. For if you were cut from what is by nature a wild olive tree, and grafted, contrary to nature, into a cultivated olive tree, how much more will these, the natural branches, be grafted back into their own olive tree. Lest you be wise in your own conceits, I want you to understand this mystery, brothers: a partial hardening has come upon Israel, until the fullness of the Gentiles has come in. And in this way all Israel will be saved, as it is written, The Deliverer will come from Zion, he will banish ungodliness from Jacob; and this will be my covenant with them when I take away their sins. As regards the gospel, they are enemies of God for your sake. But as regards election, they are beloved for the sake of their forefathers. For the gifts and the calling of God are irrevocable. Just as you were at one time disobedient to God but now have received mercy because of their disobedience, so they too have now been disobedient in order that by the mercy shown to you they also may now receive mercy. For God has consigned all to disobedience, that he may have mercy on all.

Whoever practices righteousness is righteous, as he is righteous. Whoever makes a practice of sinning is of the devil, for the devil has been sinning from the beginning. The reason the Son of God appeared was to destroy the works of the devil. No one born of God makes a practice of sinning, for God's seed abides in him, and he cannot keep on sinning because he has been born of God. By this it is evident who are the children of God, and who are the children of the devil: whoever does not practice righteousness is not of God, nor is the one who does not love his brother.

Consider him who endured from sinners such hostility against himself, so that you may not grow weary or fainthearted. In your struggle against sin you have _not yet resisted to the point of shedding your blood_. And have you forgotten the exhortation that addresses you as sons? My son, do not regard lightly the discipline of the Lord, nor be weary when reproved by him. For the Lord disciplines the one he loves, and chastises every son whom he receives. It is for discipline that you have to endure. God is treating you as sons. For what son is there whom his father does not discipline? *If you are left without discipline, in which all have participated, then you are illegitimate children and not sons*. Besides this, we have had earthly fathers who disciplined us and we respected them. Shall we not much more be subject to the Father of spirits and live? For they disciplined us for a short time as it seemed best to them, but he disciplines us for our good, that we may *share his holiness*. For the moment all discipline seems painful rather than pleasant, but later it yields the peaceful *fruit of righteousness* to those who have been trained by it.

I believe following Jesus includes exercising personal righteousness/holiness.

I believe that God's grace extends to all who
put their faith in Jesus and have Jesus'
righteousness imputed onto them, the
righteousness of faith in Jesus Christ God's
Son who has paid through his blood the price
for our sin.

Imputed righteousness is important, but we need also personal holiness.

So they are no longer two but one flesh. What therefore God has joined together, let not man separate.  They said to him, Why then did Moses command one to give a certificate of divorce and to send her away?  He said to them, Because of your hardness of heart Moses allowed you to divorce your wives, but *from the beginning it was not so*.  And I say to you: whoever divorces his wife, except for sexual immorality, and marries another, commits adultery.  The disciples said to him, If such is the case of a man with his wife, it is better not to marry.  But he said to them, Not everyone can receive this saying, but only those to whom it is given.  For there are eunuchs who have been so from birth, and there are eunuchs who have been made eunuchs by men, and there are eunuchs who have made themselves eunuchs for the sake of the kingdom of heaven.

If a newly born-again Christian is spending all their time with sinners though and endorsing continually instead of being discipled, then they can
have their mind conformed to the sinners instead of being strengthened in the truth. This is why I think it's not especially great to, immediately after getting born-again,

All things are lawful for me, but not all things are helpful. All things are lawful for me, but I will not be enslaved by anything. Food is meant for the stomach and the stomach for food-and God will destroy both one and the other. The body is not meant for sexual immorality, but for the Lord, and the Lord for the body. And God raised the Lord and will also raise us up by his power. Do you not know that your bodies are members of Christ? Shall I then take the members of Christ and make them members of a prostitute? Never! Or do you not know that he who is joined to a prostitute becomes one body with her? For, as it is written, The two will become one flesh. But he who is joined to the Lord becomes one spirit with him. Flee from sexual immorality. Every other sin a person commits is outside the body, but the sexually immoral person sins against his own body.

To be justified, a person must _walk in the footsteps of the faith that our father Abraham had before he was circumcised_, I believe with having faith in Jesus Christ:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *Romans 4:9-12* - Is this blessing then only for the circumcised, or also for the uncircumcised? We say that faith was counted to Abraham as righteousness. How then was it counted to him? Was it before or after he had been circumcised? It was not after, but before he was circumcised. He received the sign of circumcision as a seal of the righteousness that he had by faith while he was still uncircumcised. The purpose was to make him the father of all who believe without being circumcised, so that righteousness would be counted to them as well, and to make him the father of the circumcised who are _not merely circumcised but who also walk in the footsteps of the faith that our father Abraham had before he was circumcised_.

Every valley shall be filled, and every mountain and hill shall be made low, and the crooked shall become straight, and the rough places shall become level ways, and all flesh shall see the salvation of God. He said therefore to the crowds that came out to be baptized by him, You brood of vipers! Who warned you to flee from the wrath to come? _Bear fruits in keeping with repentance_.

It's possible for Gentiles to keep Jewish commandments if they want (I think it's honorable) - but we are justified by faith in Jesus, not by being under the law:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *Romans 2:25-29* - For circumcision indeed is of value if you obey the law, but if you break the law, your circumcision becomes uncircumcision. So, if a man who is uncircumcised keeps the precepts of the law, will not his uncircumcision be regarded as circumcision? Then he who is physically uncircumcised but keeps the law will condemn you who have the written code and circumcision but break the law. For no one is a Jew who is merely one outwardly, nor is circumcision outward and physical. But a Jew is one inwardly, and circumcision is a matter of the heart, by the Spirit, not by the letter. His praise is not from man but from God.

  *Matthew 5:17-25* - Do not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them. For truly, I say to you, until heaven and earth pass away, not an iota, not a dot, will pass from the Law until all is accomplished. Therefore whoever relaxes one of the least of these commandments and teaches others to do the same will be called least in the kingdom of heaven, but whoever does them and teaches them will be called great in the kingdom of heaven. For I tell you, unless your righteousness exceeds that of the scribes and Pharisees, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven. You have heard that it was said to those of old, You shall not murder; and whoever murders will be liable to judgment. But I say to you that everyone who is angry with his brother will be liable to judgment; whoever insults his brother will be liable to the council; and whoever says, You fool! will be liable to the hell of fire. So if you are offering your gift at the altar and there remember that your brother has something against you, leave your gift there before the altar and go. First be reconciled to your brother, and then come and offer your gift. Come to terms quickly with your accuser while you are going with him to court, lest your accuser hand you over to the judge, and the judge to the guard, and you be put in prison. (ESV)

And Jesus said, You shall not murder, You shall not commit adultery, You shall not steal, You shall not bear false witness, Honor your father and mother, and, You shall love your neighbor as yourself. The young man said to him, All these I have kept. What do I still lack? Jesus said to him, If you would be perfect, go, sell what you possess and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; and come, follow me. When the young man heard this he went away sorrowful, for he had great possessions. And Jesus said to his disciples, Truly, I say to you, only with difficulty will a rich person enter the kingdom of heaven. Again I tell you, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich person to enter the kingdom of God. When the disciples heard this, they were greatly astonished, saying, Who then can be saved? But Jesus looked at them and said, With man this is impossible, but with God all things are possible.

I was trying hard to follow the ten commandments from the heart, like Jesus teaches. I was doing this to seek Jesus. Then I was born-again. What a mystery.

Since then I've been trying to follow Jesus' commandments to get to know Him out of love for God, and because He has commanded His disciples to be fruitful for Him, and to abide in Him.

#   - And the Spirit is the Truth
#   - And God's Word is Truth
#     - God's Words are Truth
#     - Jesus is the Truth
#   - We must have faith in the truth (i.e. believe and trust in the truth)
# - Those who are in the faith _can't do anything against the truth_ - So those who are in the faith find no contradiction
#   - *II Corinthians 13:5-8* - Examine yourselves, to see whether you are in the faith. Test yourselves. Or do you not realize this about yourselves, that Jesus Christ is in you? —unless indeed you fail to meet the test! I hope you will find out that we have not failed the test. But we pray to God that you may not do wrong—not that we may appear to have met the test, but that you may do what is right, though we may seem to have failed. For we cannot do anything against the truth, but only for the truth.

All of these, for example,  I believe belong under the umbrella of faith, not works:

- Obeying Jesus Christ's commandments are not 'dead works'. It's obedience.

God will be the judge of who has had faith in Jesus, and who has obeyed Him.

But repentance is a work of the heart which is an act of faith.
I believe repentance is inseparable from faith because intrinsic to faith is belief and intrinsic to belief is metanoia (changing one's mind).

At it's most basic form repentance means a
person believes in Jesus as the Son of God and the Messiah who, being innocent, paid the
price for their sin through His broken body
and shed blood on the cross - a perfect and
eternal offering; that He died there but God
resurrected Him, and He is Lord of Heaven and
Earth, and has a _heart of obedience_ to the will of God,
_wanting_ to do the will of God, which involves their sanctification.
We must honour Jesus.

But I believe we are forgiven to forgive others. That must be part of the act of faith and the change of heart, I think.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *James 2:10* - For whoever keeps the whole law but fails in one point has become accountable for all of it. For he who said, Do not commit adultery, also said, Do not murder. If you do not commit adultery but do murder, you have become a transgressor of the law. So speak and so act as those who are to be judged under the law of liberty. For judgment is without mercy to one who has shown no mercy. Mercy triumphs over judgment. What good is it, my brothers, if someone says he has faith but does not have works? Can that faith save him? If a brother or sister is poorly clothed and lacking in daily food, and one of you says to them, Go in peace, be warmed and filled, without giving them the things needed for the body, what good is that? So also faith by itself, if it does not have works, is dead. But someone will say, You have faith and I have works. Show me your faith apart from your works, and I will show you my faith by my works. You believe that God is one; you do well. Even the demons believe-and shudder! Do you want to be shown, you foolish person, that faith apart from works is useless? Was not Abraham our father justified by works when he offered up his son Isaac on the altar? You see that faith was active along with his works, and faith was completed by his works; and the Scripture was fulfilled that says, Abraham believed God, and it was counted to him as righteousness-and he was called a friend of God. You see that a person is justified by works and not by faith alone.
#+END_QUOTE

I tend to agree with James on this.
Eliminating works from faith is not good.

Works:
- obedience
- faithfulness
  - keeping God's commandments
- trust
- fear of God
- response of love
  - thankfulness
  - praise
  - forgiving others
- humility
  - keeping God's commandments
- patient endurance (time)

If a person believes that Jesus Christ is the Son of the Living God then they abide in Christ.
But do they *really* believe? Because if they don't *really* believe it deep down then but are lying to themself they may not abide in Christ at all.
How can a person believe without having a relationship with God? A relationship involves more than belief.

If a person does not have obedience, trust and
repentance from sin, but their faith has belief, then they only
abide in Jesus extremely precariously, and also that person's 'faith' probably wont receive much at all from God.

  Obedience = Submitting to the Righteousness of God * Turning from sin, loving, showing mercy, etc.

Justified through (G1223 dia) faith (G4102 *pistis*) in Christ (G5547 Christos) Jesus (G2424 Iesous).
Pistis is a strong word for faith that doesn't merely encapsulate belief, but it includes trust.

The greeks can turn the noun faith into the verb believing faith (G4100 pisteuo).
It's not the noun 'believe' as the root of the verb faith

/*we have believed (G4100 pisteuo) in Christ*/ means we have /*'faithed'*/ in Christ.

The 'believing faith' verb pisteuo has a root of faith (pistis).

Faith is a relationship with God.
Before Abraham believed God, he obeyed God.

His divine power has granted to us all things that pertain to life and godliness, through the knowledge of him who called us to his own glory and excellence, by which he has granted to us his precious and very great promises, so that through them you may become partakers of the divine nature, having escaped from the corruption that is in the world because of sinful desire.  For this very reason, make every effort to supplement your faith with virtue, and virtue with knowledge, and knowledge with self-control, and self-control with steadfastness, and steadfastness with godliness, and godliness with brotherly affection, and brotherly affection with love.  For if these qualities are yours and are increasing, they keep you from being ineffective or unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ.  For whoever lacks these qualities is so nearsighted that he is blind, having forgotten that he was cleansed from his former sins.  Therefore, brothers, be all the more diligent to make your calling and election sure, for if you practice these qualities you will never fall.

** I repent from being liberal and ever endorsing LGBT or idolatry
At first, to not judge that others wear

harmless to me, but I feel like endorsing
sinful, erroneous things, or annulling laws
is not helpful in liberating people from sin.

*** Endorsing sinful things endorses people to become enslaved by sin / stuck in falsehood
Also, I feel as though endorsing it is in a
way similar to endorsing that people commit
adultery, in that it gets people stuck in sin,
even without the awareness they are in sin,
and makes it harder for people to find God.

I feel like getting a person unstuck from sin
is a bit like freeing an animal in that they
are often not aware that they need freeing.

Also, I believe that endorsing sinful behavior
or annulling God's law allows people who do
such things to come into one's life and

It's spiritual, so I think it may actually
welcome demons into a person's life to endorse

And Jesus said, You shall not murder, You shall not commit adultery, You shall not steal, You shall not bear false witness, Honor your father and mother, and, You shall love your neighbor as yourself. The young man said to him, All these I have kept. What do I still lack? Jesus said to him, If you would be perfect, go, sell what you possess and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; and come, follow me. When the young man heard this he went away sorrowful, for he had great possessions. And Jesus said to his disciples, Truly, I say to you, only with difficulty will a rich person enter the kingdom of heaven. Again I tell you, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich person to enter the kingdom of God. When the disciples heard this, they were greatly astonished, saying, Who then can be saved? But Jesus looked at them and said, With man this is impossible, but with God all things are possible.

# *Luke 1:6* - And they were both righteous before God, walking blamelessly in all the commandments and statutes of the Lord.

# *Psalms 119:1* - Blessed are those whose way is blameless, who walk in the law of the Lord!

# *Luke 1:5-6* - In the days of Herod, king of Judea, there was a priest named Zechariah, of the division of Abijah. And he had a wife from the daughters of Aaron, and her name was Elizabeth. And they were both righteous before God, walking blamelessly in all the commandments and statutes of the Lord.

# *Hebrews 11:5* - By faith Enoch was taken up so that he should not see death, and he was not found, because God had taken him. Now before he was taken he was commended as having pleased God.

# *2 Kings 2:11* - And as they still went on and talked, behold, chariots of fire and horses of fire separated the two of them.  And Elijah went up by a whirlwind into heaven.  (ESV)

# *Hebrews 11:7* - By faith Noah, being warned by God concerning events as yet unseen, in reverent fear constructed an ark for the saving of his household. By this he condemned the world and became an heir of the righteousness that comes by faith.

# *** A lot of people received John's baptism and also a lot of people followed Jesus, so they were indeed repentant

# *Psalms 5:6-8* - You destroy those who speak lies; the Lord abhors the bloodthirsty and deceitful man. But I, through the abundance of your steadfast love, will enter your house. I will bow down toward your holy temple in the fear of you. Lead me, O Lord, in your righteousness because of my enemies; make your way straight before me.

# I disagree with the calvinist perspective on this. I don't think people are unable to seek repentance.
# The entire Bible is full of repentance.

# *John 8:44* - You are of your father the devil, and your will is to do your father's desires. He was a murderer from the beginning, and has nothing to do with the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he lies, he speaks out of his own character, for he is a liar and the father of lies.

  *Deuteronomy 18:15-19* - The LORD your God will raise up for you a prophet like me from among you, from your brothers—it is to him you shall listen— just as you desired of the LORD your God at Horeb on the day of the assembly, when you said, Let me not hear again the voice of the LORD my God or see this great fire any more, lest I die. And the LORD said to me, They are right in what they have spoken. I will raise up for them a prophet like you from among their brothers. And I will put my words in his mouth, and he shall speak to them all that I command him. And whoever will not listen to my words that he shall speak in my name, I myself will require it of him. (ESV)

Walk in the truth, love one another and do not deny that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *II John 1:4-9* - I rejoiced greatly to find some of your children walking in the truth, just as we were commanded by the Father. And now I ask you, dear lady—not as though I were writing you a new commandment, but the one we have had from the beginning—that we love one another. And this is love, that we walk according to his commandments; this is the commandment, just as you have heard from the beginning, so that you should walk in it. For many deceivers have gone out into the world, those who do not confess the coming of Jesus Christ in the flesh. Such a one is the deceiver and the antichrist. Watch yourselves, so that you may not lose what we have worked for, but may win a full reward. Everyone who goes on ahead and does not abide in the teaching of Christ, does not have God. Whoever abides in the teaching has both the Father and the Son. (ESV)

Love your enemies as well as your friends. Be like Your Heavenly Father. Be perfect:

  *Matthew 5:43-48* - You have heard that it was said, You shall love your neighbor and hate your enemy. But I say to you, Love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you, so that you may be sons of your Father who is in heaven. For he makes his sun rise on the evil and on the good, and sends rain on the just and on the unjust. For if you love those who love you, what reward do you have?

Be accountable to God. Do not seek reward from others but from God. Focus on spiritual disciplines for the right reasons.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *Matthew 6:1-18* - Beware of practicing your righteousness before other people in order to be seen by them, for then you will have no reward from your Father who is in heaven. Thus, when you give to the needy, sound no trumpet before you, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets, that they may be praised by others. Truly, I say to you, they have received their reward. But when you give to the needy, do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing, so that your giving may be in secret. And your Father who sees in secret will reward you. And when you pray, you must not be like the hypocrites. For they love to stand and pray in the synagogues and at the street corners, that they may be seen by others. Truly, I say to you, they have received their reward. But when you pray, go into your room and shut the door and pray to your Father who is in secret. And your Father who sees in secret will reward you. And when you pray, do not heap up empty phrases as the Gentiles do, for they think that they will be heard for their many words. Do not be like them, for your Father knows what you need before you ask him. Pray then like this: Our Father in heaven, hallowed be your name. Your kingdom come, your will be done, on earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread, and forgive us our debts, as we also have forgiven our debtors. And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. For if you forgive others their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you, but if you do not forgive others their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses. And when you fast, do not look gloomy like the hypocrites, for they disfigure their faces that their fasting may be seen by others. Truly, I say to you, they have received their reward. But when you fast, anoint your head and wash your face, that your fasting may not be seen by others but by your Father who is in secret. And your Father who sees in secret will reward you. (ESV)

Have a relationship with God:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *Hebrews 11:6* - And without faith it is impossible to please him, for whoever would draw near to God must believe that he exists and that he rewards those who seek him. (ESV)
#+END_QUOTE

Seek heavenly reward, not earthly reward. Have a heart seeking reward from God and not from man. Have your heart in heaven, not in earth:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *Matthew 6:19-21* - Do not lay up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moth and rust destroy and where thieves break in and steal, but lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust destroys and where thieves do not break in and steal. For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also. (ESV)

Seek God's kingdom and His righteousness first of all:

Do not worry about tomorrow:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *Matthew 6:34* - Therefore do not be anxious about tomorrow, for tomorrow will be anxious for itself. Sufficient for the day is its own trouble. (ESV)
#+END_QUOTE

Use right judgment. We should be examining, judging, cleaning ourselves up, taking a look in the mirror first (by God's standards) before judging others:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *Matthew 7:1-5* - Judge not, that you be not judged. For with the judgment you pronounce you will be judged, and with the measure you use it will be measured to you. Why do you see the speck that is in your brother's eye, but do not notice the log that is in your own eye? Or how can you say to your brother, Let me take the speck out of your eye, when there is the log in your own eye? You hypocrite, first take the log out of your own eye, and then you will see clearly to take the speck out of your brother's eye. (ESV)
#+END_QUOTE

Practice discretion:

Ask, seek, and knock:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *Matthew 7:7-8* - Ask, and it will be given to you; seek, and you will find; knock, and it will be opened to you. For everyone who asks receives, and the one who seeks finds, and to the one who knocks it will be opened. (ESV)
#+END_QUOTE

Ask God for your needs, which includes asking God for the Holy Spirit:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *Luke 11:1-11* - Now Jesus was praying in a certain place, and when he finished, one of his disciples said to him, Lord, teach us to pray, as John taught his disciples. And he said to them, When you pray, say: Father, hallowed be your name. Your kingdom come. Give us each day our daily bread, and forgive us our sins, for we ourselves forgive everyone who is indebted to us. And lead us not into temptation. And he said to them, Which of you who has a friend will go to him at midnight and say to him, Friend, lend me three loaves, for a friend of mine has arrived on a journey, and I have nothing to set before him; and he will answer from within, Do not bother me; the door is now shut, and my children are with me in bed. I cannot get up and give you anything? I tell you, though he will not get up and give him anything because he is his friend, yet because of his impudence he will rise and give him whatever he needs. And I tell you, ask, and it will be given to you; *seek, and you will find*; knock, and it will be opened to you. For *everyone who asks receives*, and *the one who seeks finds*, and to *the one who knocks it will be opened*. What father among you, if his son asks for a fish, will instead of a fish give him a serpent; (ESV)

  *Matthew 7:12* - So whatever you wish that others would do to you, do also to them, for this is the Law and the Prophets. (ESV)
#+END_QUOTE

Choose the narrow path to life:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *Matthew 7:13-14* - Enter by the narrow gate. For the gate is wide and the way is easy that leads to destruction, and those who enter by it are many. For the gate is narrow and the way is hard that leads to life, and those who find it are few. (ESV)
#+END_QUOTE

Look out for false prophets:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *Matthew 7:15-20* - Beware of false prophets, who come to you in sheep's clothing but inwardly are ravenous wolves. You will recognize them by their fruits. Are grapes gathered from thornbushes, or figs from thistles? So, every healthy tree bears good fruit, but the diseased tree bears bad fruit. A healthy tree cannot bear bad fruit, nor can a diseased tree bear good fruit. Every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire. Thus you will recognize them by their fruits. (ESV)
#+END_QUOTE

Pray for kingdom laborers. Pray that God sends out kingdom laborers:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *Matthew 9:37-38* - Then he said to his disciples, The harvest is plentiful, but the laborers are few; therefore pray earnestly to the Lord of the harvest to send out laborers into his harvest. (ESV)

#+END_QUOTE

Do not fear persecutors. Fear God. But put your trust in God because He takes care of those who fear Him. Speak the truth:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *Matthew 10:26-31* - So have no fear of them, for nothing is covered that will not be revealed, or hidden that will not be known. What I tell you in the dark, say in the light, and what you hear whispered, proclaim on the housetops. And do not fear those who kill the body but cannot kill the soul. Rather fear him who can destroy both soul and body in hell. Are not two sparrows sold for a penny? And not one of them will fall to the ground apart from your Father. But even the hairs of your head are all numbered. Fear not, therefore; you are of more value than many sparrows. (ESV)
#+END_QUOTE

Take Jesus' yoke upon yourself:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *Matthew 11:28-30* - Come to me, all who labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you, and learn from me, for I am gentle and lowly in heart, and you will find rest for your souls. For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light. (ESV)
#+END_QUOTE

Do not despise the little ones:

#+END_QUOTE

How to deal with offenders:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *Matthew 18:15-17* - If your brother sins against you, go and tell him his fault, between you and him alone. If he listens to you, you have gained your brother. But if he does not listen, take one or two others along with you, that every charge may be established by the evidence of two or three witnesses. If he refuses to listen to them, tell it to the church. And if he refuses to listen even to the church, let him be to you as a Gentile and a tax collector. (ESV)
#+END_QUOTE

Forgive extremely generously / almost without limits:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *Matthew 18:21-22* - Then Peter came up and said to him, Lord, how often will my brother sin against me, and I forgive him? As many as seven times? Jesus said to him, I do not say to you seven times, but seventy times seven. (ESV)
#+END_QUOTE

Lead through service:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *Matthew 20:25-28* - But Jesus called them to him and said, You know that the rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them, and their great ones exercise authority over them. It shall not be so among you. But whoever would be great among you must be your servant, and whoever would be first among you must be your slave, even as the Son of Man came not to be served but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many.

Love God with all your heart, mind, and soul:

Stay alert and keep watch:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *Matthew 24:42-44* - Therefore, stay awake, for you do not know on what day your Lord is coming. But know this, that if the master of the house had known in what part of the night the thief was coming, he would have stayed awake and would not have let his house be broken into. Therefore you also must be ready, for the Son of Man is coming at an hour you do not expect. (ESV)
#+END_QUOTE

Make disciples of all the nations, teaching them to obey Jesus:
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *Matthew 28:18-20* - And Jesus came and said to them, All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me. Go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, teaching them to observe all that I have commanded you. And behold, I am with you always, to the end of the age. (ESV)
#+END_QUOTE

Deny yourself daily, and follow Jesus:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *Luke 9:23-24* - And he said to all, If anyone would come after me, let him deny himself and take up his cross daily and follow me. For whoever would save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for my sake will save it. (ESV)

  *Luke 14:12-14* - He said also to the man who had invited him, When you give a dinner or a banquet, do not invite your friends or your brothers or your relatives or rich neighbors, lest they also invite you in return and you be repaid. But when you give a feast, invite the poor, the crippled, the lame, the blind, and you will be blessed, because they cannot repay you. You will be repaid at the resurrection of the just. (ESV)

Those who have testimony of Jesus should preach testify that he is the one appointed by God to be judge of the living and the dead:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *Acts 10:41-44* - not to all the people but to us who had been chosen by God as witnesses, who ate and drank with him after he rose from the dead. And he commanded us to preach to the people and to testify that he is the one appointed by God to be judge of the living and the dead. To him all the prophets bear witness that everyone who believes in him receives forgiveness of sins through his name. While Peter was still saying these things, the Holy Spirit fell on all who heard the word. (ESV)

** Precepts of Paul
- Pursue godliness with contentment but not without contentment. Pursue personal righteousness
  - righteousness,
  - godliness,
  - faith,
  - love,
  - steadfastness,
  - gentleness.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *I Timothy 6:3-11* - If anyone teaches a different doctrine and does not agree with the sound words of our Lord Jesus Christ and the teaching that accords with godliness, he is puffed up with conceit and understands nothing. He has an unhealthy craving for controversy and for quarrels about words, which produce envy, dissension, slander, evil suspicions, and constant friction among people who are depraved in mind and deprived of the truth, imagining that godliness is a means of gain.  Now there is great gain in godliness with contentment, for we brought nothing into the world, and we cannot take anything out of the world.  But if we have food and clothing, with these we will be content.  But those who desire to be rich fall into temptation, into a snare, into many senseless and harmful desires that plunge people into ruin and destruction.  For the love of money is a root of all kinds of evils. It is through this craving that some have wandered away from the faith and pierced themselves with many pangs.  But as for you, O man of God, flee these things. Pursue righteousness, godliness, faith, love, steadfastness, gentleness. (ESV)

But Abram said, O Lord God, what will you give me, for I continue childless, and the heir of my house is Eliezer of Damascus? And Abram said, Behold, you have given me no offspring, and a member of my household will be my heir. And behold, the word of the Lord came to him: This man shall not be your heir; your very own son shall be your heir. And he brought him outside and said, Look toward heaven, and number the stars, if you are able to number them. Then he said to him, So shall your offspring be. And he believed the Lord, and he counted it to him as righteousness.

Rewards are for people who _choose_ to do the right thing.

It doesn't say, God rewarded God. God said that Abraham's reward shall be very great. God rewarded Abraham.

** 'Election' / predestination, theology etc. is a massive distraction, I think
I believe that here on earth, God wants us to choose Jesus. But from God's perspective, who knows how it works.

Was it before or after he had been circumcised? It was not after, but before he was circumcised. He received the sign of circumcision as a seal of the righteousness that he had by faith while he was still uncircumcised. The purpose was to make him the father of all who believe without being circumcised, so that righteousness would be counted to them as well, and to make him the father of the circumcised who are _not merely circumcised but who also walk in the footsteps of the faith that our father Abraham had before he was circumcised_.

As it is written, Jacob I loved, but Esau I hated. What shall we say then? Is there injustice on God's part? By no means! For he says to Moses, I will have mercy on whom I have mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I have compassion. So then it depends not on human will or exertion, but on God, who has mercy.

And those whom he predestined he also called, and those whom he called he also justified, and those whom he justified he also glorified. What then shall we say to these things? If God is for us, who can be against us? He who did not spare his own Son but gave him up for us all, how will he not also with him graciously give us all things? Who shall bring any charge against God's elect? It is God who justifies. Who is to condemn? Christ Jesus is the one who died—more than that, who was raised—who is at the right hand of God, who indeed is interceding for us. Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? Shall tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or danger, or sword? As it is written, For your sake we are being killed all the day long; we are regarded as sheep to be slaughtered. No, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him who loved us. For I am sure that neither death nor life, nor angels nor rulers, nor things present nor things to come, nor powers, nor height nor depth, nor anything else in all creation, will be able to separate us from the love of God in Christ Jesus our Lord.

- The elect fear God
  - They had soft hearts
    - able to believe and obey
- The non-elect *judge themselves* unworthy of eternal life
  - They had hard hearts
    - unable to believe and obey

One thing is for sure. The elect do not have hard hearts.
So I'd say if a person's heart is not totally hard, then soften it.

A heart not easy to be moved with virtuous affections:
- *Deuteronomy 15:7* - If among you, one of your brothers should become poor, in any of your towns within your land that the Lord your God is giving you, you shall not harden your heart or shut your hand against your poor brother, (ESV)
- *Mark 3:4-5* - And He said to them, “Is it lawful to do good or to do harm on the Sabbath, to save a life or to kill?” But they kept silent. After looking around at them with anger, grieved at their hardness of heart, He said to the man, “Stretch out your hand.” And he stretched it out, and his hand was restored. (ESV)
- [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaMVzW9yiBc][Do I Have a Hard Heart? - YouTube]]
- *Mark 8:17* - And Jesus, aware of this, said to them, Why are you discussing the fact that you have no bread? Do you not yet perceive or understand? Are your hearts hardened? (ESV)
- *II Chronicles 36:12-13* - He did what was evil in the sight of the Lord his God. He did not humble himself before Jeremiah the prophet, who spoke from the mouth of the Lord. He also rebelled against King Nebuchadnezzar, who had made him swear by God. He stiffened his neck and hardened his heart against turning to the Lord, the God of Israel. (ESV)
- *Romans 2:4* - Or do you presume on the riches of his kindness and forbearance and patience, not knowing that God's kindness is meant to lead you to repentance? (ESV)
- *Zechariah 7:12* - They made their hearts diamond-hard lest they should hear the law and the words that the Lord of hosts had sent by his Spirit through the former prophets. Therefore great anger came from the Lord of hosts. (ESV)

If we have a hard heart, we should ask for a new one:
- *Ezekiel 36:26* - And I will give you a new heart, and a new spirit I will put within you. And I will remove the heart of stone from your flesh and give you a heart of flesh.

Don't let your heart go hard - find a community of encouraging believers:
- *Hebrews 3:13* - But exhort one another every day, as long as it is called today, that none of you may be hardened by the deceitfulness of sin.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *Acts 13:46-48* - And Paul and Barnabas spoke out boldly, saying, It was necessary that the word of God be spoken first to you.  Since you thrust it aside and *judge yourselves unworthy* of eternal life, behold, we are turning to the Gentiles.  For so the Lord has commanded us, saying, I have made you a light for the Gentiles, that you may bring salvation to the ends of the earth.  And when the Gentiles heard this, they began rejoicing and glorifying the word of the Lord, and as many as were appointed to eternal life believed. (ESV)
#+END_QUOTE

I do believe, however, that *cooperation* is generally required on the part of the believer:
- Before regeneration, and
- After regeneration

Before regeneration, I was trying hard to repent of my sin by trying to obey the 10 commandments from the heart.
And I would say I was also making progress.
After regeneration, I had to learn to walk in Jesus' commandments, and to submit to His righteousness.

To be sanctified by faith in Jesus is an applied process, I think:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *Acts 26:18* - to open their eyes, so that they may turn from darkness to light and from the power of Satan to God, that they may receive forgiveness of sins and a place among those who are *sanctified by faith in me*. (ESV)
#+END_QUOTE

In similar fashion to Jesus continually obeying Father God as he endured suffering, I think we should learn to submit and follow Jesus' commandments

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *Hebrews 5:7-10* - In the days of his flesh, Jesus offered up prayers and supplications, with loud cries and tears, to him who was able to save him from death, and he was heard because of his reverence. _Although he was a son, he learned obedience through what he suffered._ And being made perfect, he became the source of eternal salvation to all who obey him, being designated by God a high priest after the order of Melchizedek.
#+END_QUOTE

I believe that after being [[https://web.archive.org/web/20220402091720/https://mullikine.github.io/posts/astral-projection/][born-again of the spirit]], I had (with very little knowledge of Jesus' commandments) had to learn Jesus' commandments and apply them, and I believe the Holy Spirit taught me to obey Jesus as I read Jesus' sayings and was subsequently tested on those sayings. For example, if I read that we must give to all who ask, and then the Lord sets up a situation where someone asks for money, then I have a choice to obey Jesus, which means resisting those who try to deter me from obeying Jesus. Upon being tested, someone would offer worldly wisdom in an attempt to deter me from following Jesus, and as I obey God I am led by the Holy Spirit, and taught by the Holy Spirit. And this is an ongoing process. I say this for others' sake to explain how I have come to know how faith in Jesus, following Jesus, works practically, that it is more than mere intellectual belief to be led by the Spirit, but it is also obedience, and a process of sanctification, and walking in the light.

So I was born-again of the Spirit and when that happened I was given some very strong faith/knowledge that God exists, but I still had to seek Jesus because the Bible says that anyone who
claims to know Jesus but doesn't walk in His commandments is not telling the truth, and I want to come to know Jesus.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *Luke 3:3-8* - And he went into all the region around the Jordan, proclaiming a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins. As it is written in the book of the words of Isaiah the prophet, The voice of one crying in the wilderness: Prepare the way of the Lord, make his paths straight. Every valley shall be filled, and every mountain and hill shall be made low, and the crooked shall become straight, and the rough places shall become level ways, and all flesh shall see the salvation of God. He said therefore to the crowds that came out to be baptized by him, You brood of vipers! Who warned you to flee from the wrath to come? _Bear fruits in keeping with repentance_. And do not begin to say to yourselves, We have Abraham as our father. For I tell you, _God is able from these stones to raise up children for Abraham._

I came from the Father and have come into the world, and now I am leaving the world and going to the Father. His disciples said, Ah, now you are speaking plainly and not using figurative speech! Now we know that you know all things and do not need anyone to question you; this is why we believe that you came from God. Jesus answered them, Do you now believe? Behold, the hour is coming, indeed it has come, when you will be scattered, each to his own home, and will leave me alone. Yet I am not alone, for the Father is with me.

So Jesus said to the Twelve, Do you want to go away as well? Simon Peter answered him, Lord, to whom shall we go? You have the words of eternal life, and we have believed, and have come to know, that you are the Holy One of God.

But as he considered these things, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream, saying, Joseph, son of David, do not fear to take Mary as your wife, for that which is conceived in her is from the Holy Spirit. She will bear a son, and you shall call his name Jesus, for he will save his people from their sins. All this took place to fulfill what the Lord had spoken by the prophet: Behold, the virgin shall conceive and bear a son, and _they shall call his name Immanuel (which means, God with us)_. When Joseph woke from sleep, he did as the angel of the Lord commanded him: he took his wife, but knew her not until she had given birth to a son. And he called his name Jesus. (ESV)

** God adopts children, fellow heirs with Christ
The sons of God on earth who are being adopted by God:
- are led by the Spirit
  - obeying Jesus Christ
- are sons of Abraham, with the faith of Abraham
  - demonstrating the faith that Abraham had
- have had faith in Jesus Christ's name
- suffer with Christ in order to be glorified with Him
- await their adoption as sons when our bodies are redeemed
- have the creation eagerly longing for their revealing
- have heard God and had faith

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *Romans 8:14-23* - For _all who are led by the Spirit of God are sons of God._ For you did not receive the spirit of slavery to fall back into fear, but you have received the Spirit of adoption as sons, by whom we cry, Abba! Father! The Spirit himself bears witness with our spirit that we are children of God, and if children, then heirs—heirs of God and fellow heirs with Christ, _provided we suffer with him in order that we may also be glorified with him._ For I consider that the sufferings of this present time are not worth comparing with the glory that is to be revealed to us. For the creation waits with eager longing for the revealing of the sons of God. For the creation was subjected to futility, not willingly, but because of him who subjected it, in hope that the creation itself will be set free from its bondage to decay and obtain the freedom of the glory of the children of God. For we know that the whole creation has been groaning together in the pains of childbirth until now. And not only the creation, but we ourselves, who have the firstfruits of the Spirit, groan inwardly as _we wait eagerly for adoption as sons, the redemption of our bodies._ (ESV)

Receiving is a mixture of believing, obeying, trusting, believing to receive - as Abraham's faith was. The faith to receive Jesus, getting to know Him I think is a span of time (it could be instantaneous to a lengthy period of time), I presume, as a person continues to trust Him:

  *Romans 4:9-12* - Is this blessing then only for the circumcised, or also for the uncircumcised? We say that faith was counted to Abraham as righteousness. How then was it counted to him? Was it before or after he had been circumcised? It was not after, but before he was circumcised. He received the sign of circumcision as a seal of the righteousness that he had by faith while he was still uncircumcised. The purpose was to make him the father of all who believe without being circumcised, so that righteousness would be counted to them as well, and to make him the father of the circumcised who are _not merely circumcised but who also walk in the footsteps of the faith that our father Abraham had before he was circumcised_.

Gathering them together, He commanded them not to leave Jerusalem, but to wait for what the Father had promised, “Which,” He said, “you heard of from Me; for John baptized with water, but you will be baptized with the Holy Spirit not many days from now.” So when they had come together, they were asking Him, saying, “Lord, is it at this time You are restoring the kingdom to Israel?” He said to them, “It is not for you to know times or epochs which the Father has fixed by His own authority; but you will receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you; and you shall be My witnesses both in Jerusalem, and in all Judea and Samaria, and even to the remotest part of the earth.” And after He had said these things, He was lifted up while they were looking on, and a cloud received Him out of their sight. And as they were gazing intently into the sky while He was going, behold, two men in white clothing stood beside them. They also said, “Men of Galilee, why do you stand looking into the sky? This Jesus, who has been taken up from you into heaven, will come in just the same way as you have watched Him go into heaven.” Then they returned to Jerusalem from the mount called Olivet, which is near Jerusalem, a Sabbath day’s journey away.

I believe in all of theses:

- =sola fida= (by faith alone) AMEN!!.
  - The justifying faith may include 'acts of faith', which is just visible faith.
  - Works done outside of faith *do not* qualify for justification.
- =sola gratia= (by grace alone) AMEN!!

*** Glorification is Christ-likeness
Glorification is the good works including forgiving others, relieving others' burdens, etc. suffering for the sake of righteousness and obedience to God.

Imitating Jesus, forgiving others, walking righteously, and doing good works (bearing one-another's burdens) glorifies Jesus and glorifies God.

This should never replace Jesus, but glorifies Jesus because it's being a disciple of Jesus.

# + Total depravity (Calvinism) :: Humanity possesses "free will", but it is in bondage to sin, until it is "transformed".
# + Total depravity (Lutheranism) :: Humanity possesses free will in regard to "goods and possessions", but is sinful by nature and unable to contribute to its own salvation.
# + Total depravity (Arminianism) :: Humanity possesses freedom from necessity, but not "freedom from sin" unless enabled by "prevenient grace".

# ** My beliefs

# Not everyone is saved those who are sanctified by the Spirit through faith:

# *II Thessalonians 2:11-14* - Therefore God sends them a strong delusion, so that they may believe what is false, in order that all may be condemned who did not believe the truth but had pleasure in unrighteousness. But we ought always to give thanks to God for you, brothers beloved by the Lord, because God chose you as the firstfruits to be saved, through *sanctification by the Spirit* _and_ *belief in the truth*. To this he called you through our gospel, so that you may obtain the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ.

* Jesus Christ is God become flesh!
Jesus Christ is the Word of God become flesh - this is what I believe - not just God *in* the flesh but God *become* flesh:

And all the angels were standing around the throne and around the elders and the four living creatures, and they fell on their faces before the throne and worshiped God, saying, Amen! Blessing and glory and wisdom and thanksgiving and honor and power and might be to our God forever and ever! Amen.  (ESV)
