** <2024-10-20 Sun>
My earliest memories are of living in Miramar before Weta Workshop.
Today at C3 Church, the pastor took an analogy from Lord of the Rings to describe sin.
What Frodo may have experienced in fiction, carrying the one ring, reminds me of my experience over the last 2 years.
In the books, the ring amplifies evil. The ring turned Sm√©agol into Gollum.
That's like what sin does to people - it corrupts people and the effects are:
- they are corrupted from the image of God.
- blindness to their condition, death.

People are born with corruption, but as people turn away from the truth and commit sin the corruption magnifies. It doesn't get better.

Corruption gets increasingly worse without atonement by blood.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *[[https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hebrews%209%3A22&version=ESV][Hebrews 9:22]]* - Indeed, under the law almost everything is purified with blood, and *without the shedding of blood there is no forgiveness of sins*. (ESV)

Jesus said in [[https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2023%3A26&version=ESV][Matthew 23:26]] (from the ESV), "You blind Pharisee! First clean the inside of the cup and the plate, that the outside also may be clean."
We really don't want corruption in our heart or impurity in our spirit. The outside reflects what's going on inside us, and I don't mean merely our outward appearance. Dare I confess this but I will for the sake of others so they may take sin seriously, after being born-again as I had been repenting (even after being born-again), I have seen things that have made me feel like in some sense my spiritual innocence has been stolen.

While sin corrupts, the grace of God through blood of Jesus can restore us. He is the perfect man, and His blood washes us clean from corruption.

I just didn't expect that after I was born-again that there was going to be a spiritual battle. But there is a battle, and it hit me fast and hard.

Like traumatised Frodo where Hobbiton was essentially ruined for him, I have among other things asked to be born-again again, and that I can be [[https://meninblack.fandom.com/wiki/Neuralyzer][neuralyzed]] because of what I've been through, or raptured and taken to heaven, everything new. But I'm still here, it seems. At least I've been brought into Christ.

He is like a tree planted by streams of water that yields its fruit in its season, and its leaf does not wither. In all that he does, he prospers. The wicked are not so, but are like chaff that the wind drives away. Therefore the wicked will not stand in the judgment, nor sinners in the congregation of the righteous; for the LORD knows the way of the righteous, but the way of the wicked will perish. (ESV)

  *[[https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%2021%3A15-18&version=ESV][John 21:15-18]]* - When they had finished breakfast, Jesus said to Simon Peter, Simon, son of John, do you love me more than these? He said to him, Yes, Lord; you know that I love you. He said to him, Feed my lambs. He said to him a second time, Simon, son of John, do you love me? He said to him, Yes, Lord; you know that I love you. He said to him, Tend my sheep. He said to him the third time, Simon, son of John, do you love me? Peter was grieved because he said to him the third time, Do you love me? and he said to him, Lord, you know everything; you know that I love you. Jesus said to him, Feed my sheep. Truly, truly, I say to you, when you were young, you used to dress yourself and walk wherever you wanted, but when you are old, you will stretch out your hands, and another will dress you and carry you where you do not want to go.

A bunch of other stuff happened but my days are too packed to explain it all.

* <2025-02-05 Wed> Journal
When it comes to dreams I get, I don't trust anything which doesn't confess Jesus, but I will often take them and use them as prompts to do a Bible study, and run things by the Scripture.

** I had a dream conversation with someone
Lots of tall waves going through a town square.
Me clinging to the top of a tall streetlight to withstand waves of water flowing through what looked like a courtyard.
I then talked to a young kid (and I remember seeing a square rainbow) explaining to him what is love.

God loved us first, and we then love.
A crucial part of love is forgiveness.
We forgive because God forgave us first.
God loved us first. God forgave us first.

Then I heard a voice that said, "God says abide in love".
And I thought be rooted and grounded in love.

In the dream, though, the name "Jesus" wasn't confessed at all, and neither was there a call to holiness.

Also I want to stress, that God's grace teaches us to deny ungodliness:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *[[https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Titus%202%3A11-14&version=ESV][Titus 2:11-14]]* - For the grace of God has appeared, bringing salvation for all people, training us to renounce ungodliness and worldly passions, and to live self-controlled, upright, and godly lives in the present age, waiting for our blessed hope, the appearing of the glory of our great God and Savior Jesus Christ, who gave himself for us to redeem us from all lawlessness and to purify for himself a people for his own possession who are zealous for good works. (ESV)
#+END_QUOTE

** A second dream: I just said this in a dream as a response to a question - it's spiritually inspired, hopefully from God
- Why do we love, We love because God loved us first.
- We forgive because God forgave us first.
- Why are we to be holy? Because God said, "Be holy for I am Holy."

So why do we not want to be dominated by superintelligent AI? Because God designed us to take dominion over the planet, not to be overcome by it.

*** Christians spread our kingdom not through physical force
For those in Christ, we don't seek world domination, but by seeking the kingdom of God and His righteousness through faith in Jesus who is the Christ, the Son of God, we "overcome the world". And we are sanctified, keeping God's commandments, loving one another in Christ, and coming to the knowledge of the Truth, knowledge of God the Father and God the Son with His Holy Spirit, and receive an inheritance in Christ in heaven. we do that by being found in Christ, we do that by being servants in Christ.

** Yesterday morning among all the spiritual attack I got, I heard in my sleep

** More spiritual attack - a diatribe

+ Journal: <2025-03-15 Sat> :: I'm sick and tired of being left undelivered from this defiling spiritual prison which I have been put in, prevented from working and marrying and continually harassed by demons, seeing sides to people I love which I wish I could have totally erased from my memory forever. I am begging You God to make this evil end today. I feel as though there are still demons which are keeping track of the amount of money I have and accusing me and slandering me when I'm trying to obey Jesus to the best of my ability.
  What I have been put through has been a living nightmare.
  This morning yet another day just being harassed by evil dreams and visions being pushed into my head, and this [[https://pastorvlad.org/spiritualspouses/][spirit spouse]] stuff, and the unreasonable amount of being put on trial.
  If it's not an actual courthouse then it's demons challenging me through various people over extreme scrutiny of my obedience to Jesus.
  While I am continually "ghosted" by people going silent on me - it's absolutely satanic stuff.
  It's been well over 2 years of this type of torment now, almost exactly daily.
  The events surrounding me being born-again of the Spirit are pure abomination.
  There's things I have witnessed that are unspeakably dark and scar my memory.
  I wish that God would make me born-again again whilst erasing my memories and ensure the types of things I have been through would never recur in this life or the next.
  I feel like my redemption is the most compromised botched-job redemption in the history of mankind.
  It's a living and enduring hell on earth which I've been going though - spiritually.
  In the material, NZ is pretty OK, but spiritually I'm being put through hell making the events of 2020-2021 regarding the covid pandemic and lockdowns look like nothing.
  But I know the Christians in Syria, for example, are suffering terribly - I can't imagine how awful it would be for them.
  But it's no consolation to me to be allowed to go on living in this world.
  I'd definitely rather not be here in this world.
  Is it too much to ask of God to be delivered from almost continual demonic harassment?
  I assume that [[https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Corinthians%2012%3A9&version=ESV][II Corinthians 12:9]]'s "My grace is sufficient for you" does not apply.
  How can anyone function when the joy of being clean, being saved, or being able to help people in need or being able to have a wife or family is taken away?
  What has continued harassing me and trying to destroy my life is disgusting.
  To practice righteousness is a right given to people who trust in Jesus' name so I consider to not
  be able to do so to be a violation of my right in believing in Jesus
  and to be prevented from doing so is antichrist.

** Yesterday on <2025-03-16 Sun> - an encouragement
At church at both [[.][Elim]] and [[https://www.c3dunedin.org/][C3]] yesterday the last song we sang was "[[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xx7eoZAMzgo][We Exalt Thee]]".
And at C3 yesterday my pastor started the new series on Contending prayer, and highlighted the book of Habbakuk,
a prophet who prayed such prayers as this:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *[[https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Habakkuk%201%3A1-3&version=ESV][Habakkuk 1:1-3]]* - The oracle that Habakkuk the prophet saw.

#+END_QUOTE

That was an encouragement.

** <2025-03-17 Mon>
This morning I get a dream of a big sign outside the SpaceX rocket facility which just says Jesus is [our] King and Lord - well I'd hope that is
what the people there believe.
Actually, I'll describe the full dream because it was kinda funny.

#+BEGIN_SRC text -n :async :results verbatim code :lang text
  Firstly, in the dream this morning, there was a large rocket on the launchpad with the top half
  slightly askew, and rocket fuel having leaked on the pavement, and Elon and a bunch of others walking towards
  the rocket, saw it and realised they were walking near the rocket fuel and with
  worried faces slowly paced back in reverse.
  Then I saw a bunch of firefighters levitating over the pavement with hoses squirting some kind
  of fire retardant liquid over the exposed rocket fuel, making it so the fuel could not ignite.
  They were hovering down the pavement neutralising the rocket fuel,
  the soles of shoes were spraying neutraliser themselves onto the pavement below, making them hover over the pavement,
  working like little jetpacks for their feet - it was a cool dream.
  
  Then I myself made my way through the side office building and on the interior wall
  was a sign which just said "Jesus is [our] King and Lord" (I think it may have said 'our'. I'm recalling something I say in a dream. I can't remember precisely.),
  and an old mate from old workplace Tim F. was linking arms with me.
#+END_SRC

Funny dream, sure, but honestly, I have no interest in working in technology again.
I don't want raptor engines. I want to be raptured. I want to be delivered from several things:
- spirit spouse stuff
- harassing dreams and visions which have nothing to do with God, and nothing to do with serving God, and nothing to do with the truth of God

Just because a dream contained the name of Jesus in it does not make it a true dream.
Also, I'm not saying building rockets to set up a mars base is unloving or evil or anything like that (*Genesis 1:26*).
But I've been trying to fight back against whatever has been trying to pressure me to go back to my old-creation self, and the pressure has been huge.
For example, the pressure against me repenting from being indifferent about LGBT, for example, has been huge.
As soon as I began repenting of that, the devil began harassing me with LGBT-affirming dreams and dreams which are outright lewd and kept bombarding me with that nonsense for at least a couple of years now almost daily.
When I want to focus on Jesus, the devil also deprives me of sleep and wakes me up to dreams of technology and first-person shootem-ups.
During Lent I've been bombarded with visions of eating things.
This type of thing - demonic harassment.

So the dream must have a confession of the truth about Jesus and to be sure
about it it needs to have a confession of specifically the exact thing
that the Apostle John mentions in [[https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20John%204%3A2&version=ESV][I John 4:2]] as the Apostle John meant it. And the dream I had today
doesn't leave me totally trusting of it. God is not a God of confusion.
He knows what I expect to hear to trust a dream:

  *[[https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20John%204%3A2&version=ESV][I John 4:2]]* - By this you know the Spirit of God: every spirit that confesses that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is from God, (ESV)
#+END_QUOTE

I'm so sick of being in this world, and when I pray and ask for things, I seem to never get what I pray and ask for.
In fact, often it just seems as though I get precisely the opposite of what I ask for.
It's just a constant struggle.
I've [[./abominations.org][publicly rebuked the ASI/AGI stuff]] including on my online [[abominations.org][bible study]], and I've never reneged on my stance of it,
being tested through people I have even mentioned it'll never make its way into heaven.
If I was the gatekeeper, I would never allow it. But it just seems sometimes as though evil is unstoppable,
and no matter how much I rebuke something, sometimes the evil just doesn't go away.
And no matter how much I ask God for something which I believe the Scripture says is in His will, I don't receive it,
and worse, it's as though I get the opposite.
When I heard about that stargate project announcement only a few days into the new US presidency,
Instead of smacking down the greed-propelled tower-of-babel false-saviour abomination that it is,
I felt like God in allowing it literally delivers another punch to my face,
and it makes me question whether by allowing it He even cares about people.
The transhumanism propelled ASI/AGI stuff is far worse than the COVID pandemic.
I hate being here in this world so much.
I hate feeling like satan is in control of the world.
I wish that I could have proper joy again over my salvation, and even my prophetic gift again.
I've been asking for deliverance for so long, and I'm sick of being isolated.
I feel as though the crushing pressure on me from all directions has really gotten to me.
I don't get it. I haven't received what I've told God that I have needed for so long,
I'm not a chatbot, I'm a human being.
And in some sense I think not receiving the answers I believe I've needed
has left me with a defiled conscience. What I don't understand is when I ask God for things I believe are in His will and I don't get them,
such as for guidance, or help to get a job so I can help other people in need or my relatives/dependents, or for deliverance from
spiritual attack especially in my sleep.
I was in court in 2022 and I said in a letter to the judge that I forgive the other side and don't bear a grudge,
but the door of freedom on the other side is slammed shut
as if to pressure me to reneging on my declaration that I forgive and want to move on,
then it seems like there is spiritual pressure on me to be denied to walk forwards in the truth, and that has been very confusing for me.
Likewise, wanting to turn away from working in Artificial Intelligence / technology and instead find a job helping people,
I've also been prevented from doing so.
Joy-stealing is quite destructive on a person - like undermining a person's joy, particularly in joy God, but also joy in family, is very destructive.
It destroys morale, it makes it much harder to maintain a strong faith and love for God when the joy is undermined.
It's also not the Kingdom of God to be without joy.
It certainly seems as though I've been getting denied the kingdom of God by whatever antichrist spirits have been trying to take away righteousness, peace and joy from me,
that is, righteousness, peace and joy in the Holy Spirit. Yes, whatever is out there and around me attacking me, and meddling in my relationships, has been surely not of the kingdom of God.

Yes, the joy, faith and love though are all rooted in a good conscience with God which is foundational. But seeking to have a good conscience with God, it seems as though
everything has come against me from every direction to try to stop my joy, my faith and my love.

Now if I'm given a conviction in a court of law, then I should be offered the ability to work afterwards, so I can help others. Yet I have been unable to find work I think at least partially because now I have a criminal record.

Reality of what I've experienced and are still going through:

- I feel like the corrupting influence of demons assailing me at night and when I sit down has left me feeling a little corrupted.
- I've been denied to live like a human being. Denied work, marriage, etc.
  - Imagine a dog chained to a pole and for years, and now substitute dog for human being, and that's basically my situation.
- My flesh feels corrupt as a result of being in what feels like the pit/abyss or on the verge of it.
- I have been harassed by evil spirits near continuously for close to 3 years.
  - Particularly at night. Basically every night I receive invasive dreams, visions and voices which are against the truth of God.
  - Almost every day I go to bed fully expecting God will deliver me, but it hasn't happened, and I'm at this point now.
- I feel like I missed the rapture and got abandoned to Hades/Sheol.
- I had simply tried to follow Jesus out of faith, love, obedience for Jesus after getting born-again and this happened to me.
- My joy is basically gone.
  - My joyous feeling of being washed clean by the blood of Jesus has been taken away.
    - That happened once, but now I feel like a dirty garment.
  - It feels like my good conscience with God has been corrupted. I haven't been given answers that I need and I've been forced forward without them.
- I feel like the entire world has become a personal hell created just for me after I called-out the AI stuff and then got born-again.
  - Now I feel like I'm forced to live in hell tailored/designed specifically for me
  - I feel like the AI stuff just rammed itself into my born-again life / tries to force itself into the kingdom of heaven
    - Well living inside a video-game or being forced to treat robots like people is definitely not heaven to me
- Given marriage denial, and being forced to be in this world and feeling ignored by God, my heart is almost always downcast and depressed now.
- On [[https://web.archive.org/web/20220402091720/https://mullikine.github.io/posts/astral-projection-pt-2/][3 May 2022]] it was me who confessed to whatever spirit was there that my God is the True God, the God of Truth, Jesus saved me from lies and the Holy Spirit is my comforter
  - I confessed it. I asked the spirit if it was the Holy Spirit and the spirit said, "Yes. I'll take a look at you."
  - Was it the Holy Spirit?
    - Despite [[https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%205%3A37&version=ESV][Matt 5:37]], the correct interpretation of [[https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%205%3A37&version=ESV][Matt 5:37]] may bee seen in James 5:12 and Matt 23:16-22.
    - It was me who confessed Jesus, not the spirit I spoke to. So the spirit I spoke to is untrustworthy.
- On 3 May 2023 I pleaded guilty in court because I didn't want to hurt anyone, and I was still trying to follow Jesus.
- On <2025-01-13 Mon> Monday, I woke up to a voice which said, "What is your faith in?" I responded like this, "My faith is in the Word of God. Jesus Christ and His finished works is the cornerstone of my faith, and keeping and doing his commandments is the foundation of my faith. I obey Righteousness because I obey Jesus. I believe in the Truth because I believe in Jesus." I didn't know but it turned out to be the last day of my sentence.
  - Once again, it's *me* making the confession of faith. And that is what frustrates me. Because I cannot trust the spirits speaking to me.
- God hasn't spoken to me directly to clear things up.

I have some consolation in the fact that I definitely have been chosen out of this world and am not of it,
and that I won't have to have it in my life one day.
I feel like I definitely do not belong in this world.

God, I just want deliverance. I want the Lord to make it work for good. I've been through hell ever since I got born-again.

May the Lord Jesus Christ please give me mercy and forgive me for taking out my frustrations on him (especially today), but I have been under such heavy spiritual attack as I follow Him. It's so difficult. The last week has been horrible. Dream attacks and soul-attacks every day. By soul-attacks I mean, manipulating thoughts and senses (spirit-spouse stuff, for example), or getting pictures in my mind as I am trying to concentrate on Jesus' words, say. The pictures are to distract. It's like everything just tries to deter me from obedience to Christ - whether it be the reproach, or the dream attacks, or the fear of punishment or when people (even or especially Christians) dissuade from taking every thought captive to Christ - people don't know how to combat the devil, Biblically, which is through faith and obedience to Jesus Christ (consider [[https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%2016%3A19-20&version=ESV][Romans 16:19-20]], or Re 12:11). I'm constantly rubbing up against the unsanctified parts of fellow Christians who say the opposite of what Jesus and the new testament authors teach. I've received so much reproach, and get hit with dream attacks every day. God give me mercy. The darkness has been a thick cloud around me for a very long time (2 years at least). Trying to remain focused on Jesus.

Teaching the gospel should be about knowing Jesus Christ (His commandments, teachings and prophetic writings about Him, His deeds) and Him crucified:

I have found that the enemy has been battling extremely hard to steal my thoughts away from Jesus.
The way to fight the enemy away effectively is:
- Think about His words
- Sing worship music in my head
- Obedience to Jesus

The difficult, striving part is mostly in the mind, and heart, and it is keeping my mind, my eyes on Jesus like Peter on the water. I have one Father in heaven. But yesterday I told my earthly dad that "Satan was attacking my mind as the pastor was praying at church. I was getting pummeled by distracting images appearing in my mind as the pastor was praying. But I was under attack like this a lot over the last 3 days", and he responded by saying "Stop trying to obey Jesus. Stop striving." This is what he said right after I mentioned I am under attack. And I also said something I regretted saying almost immediately. And I have asked God probably a hundred times to make the memories of such encounters disappear, and to make it never happen again. But these confrontations continued to happen. This is me explaining that the spiritual attack has been like a thick blanket affecting everything - affecting me in my sleep, affecting my relationships. And it feels like being caught between the wheat and the tares - one force trying to pull me into an "age of evil", and the other when I focus on Jesus, pulling me out of it.

When it comes to family members or people at church saying to do opposite to what the teachings of Jesus and the Apostles say, I recognise that people sometimes speak or act from the flesh, not from the Spirit, but in my observing this means very little, and we'll see each other's unsanctified bits sometimes but the right thing to do is to "love those who hate you."

#+END_QUOTE

The enemy has been trying to fill my head with all sorts of distracting thoughts as I seek to think about Jesus, and is continually trying to get an edge over me in my fight to maintain Jesus' works.
The enemy keeps trying to steal my attention away from Jesus, and dissuade me from taking every thought captive for Christ, and trying to maintain Jesus' works feels like being bled dry to emotional, physical and spiritual breaking-point, for the sake of remaining faithful to Jesus / maintaining good conscience with Jesus / doing what pleases Him.
And when I tell people I'm under attack, I often get more resistance through people who are thinking in the flesh.
I must fight against this.
However, I'm extremely discouraged now that I haven't been physically taken out of the world.
The gospel is that we are delivered from the present evil age.
And if it seems impossible to be delivered from it through any amount of striving then I end up praying angry prayers to God, and I am angry with God about the amount of spiritual warfare I've been facing, and about being kept here in a world permeated with AI. It feels like satan has taken over the churches.

Yesterday, before I went to bed I had briefly seen a video:
- [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nomEdbsx3Tw][youtube.com: Sermon: The Queenship of Mary, by Most Rev. Donald J. Sanborn {@romancatholicmedia}]]
I found it contrived, and distressing the way that Mary was described here as the spiritual spouse of Jesus.
The truth is that Christ's body, the Chruch is the spiritual spouse of Jesus.
And although often Roman Catholics like to claim that the members of their institution is Church or that the Roman Catholic church is the Catholic church, I wholeheartedly disagree.
At best they would be part-of. But the church is the body of Christ (all people who are or have been or will be spiritually united with Christ).

Yesterday, before I went to bed I played StarCraft II and someone on the other team calling themself "LORD" defeated me.
That actually happened.
then I went to bed telling God, I honestly thought I had something good easily taken away from me, because like someone who had never known what it was like to have something good, I was an easy target for the devil to make me think it was bad because it was too good. I had told God before sleeping that it was His fault I was in this situation. It seems like every time I complain to God, I have demons/satan rushing in, as if they're watching what I do, interfering. When I complain to God, I am waiting for deliverance, but the demons which are harassing me are trying to offer a false deliverance.

Something like someone calling themself LORD, happening in real life is no reason to trust anything. Even in the Bible God Himself calls deceptive words man's appellation of the temple that it was God's temple.

Do not trust in these deceptive words: This is the temple of the LORD, the temple of the LORD, the temple of the LORD. For if you truly amend your ways and your deeds, if you truly execute justice one with another, if you do not oppress the sojourner, the fatherless, or the widow, or shed innocent blood in this place, and if you do not go after other gods to your own harm, then I will let you dwell in this place, in the land that I gave of old to your fathers forever. *Behold, you trust in deceptive words to no avail. Will you steal, murder, commit adultery, swear falsely, make offerings to Baal, and go after other gods that you have not known, and then come and stand before me in this house, which is called by my name, and say, We are delivered! ‚Äî only to go on doing all these abominations? Has this house, which is called by my name, become a den of robbers in your eyes?* Behold, I myself have seen it, declares the LORD. (ESV)
#+END_QUOTE

I went to sleep around midnight.

So at 1 AM, after sleeping 1 hour I wake up the first time.
I can't remember if it was that time or later that I had a dream or something, where in my mind I was saying something like,
"I will not pray the our Father."
Then I woke up and I prayed the our Father prayer in my heart anyway.

Our Father who art in Heaven, hallowed by thy name.
Thy kingdom come, thy will be done on earth as it is done in heaven.
Give us this day our daily bread and forgive us our debts/trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us.
And lead us not into temptation but deliver us from evil.
For Yours are the kingdom and the power and the glory,
forever and ever. AMEN!!

Even though I do not want to be goaded by demons, I decided to just do what is true anyway and pray to God,
and satan has no part in it.
But I will not be goaded by demons. I didn't pray it "because" the demons say "don't do it".
I prayed because I was woken up, against my will, and I decided I would pray it anyway.

I went back to sleep. I think I might have woken up again and it might have been actually around this time I had that dream of "I will not pray the our Father" prayer. I'm slightly dazed by the sleep disturbances so it's hard to be certain of the exact order.
I also after this had another picture in my sleep "May the Lord Jesus Christ sanctify you completely." Something like this.
And I have prayed to God so many times asking Him to deliver me from the demonic harassment.

So just then at 7AM I got a dream of me telling mum, (meg and ryan there too I think)
that my crypto would be worth 30 million if I had kept it but I was trusting Jesus (and I was thinking, trusting Jesus as I was giving to people who were asking me for help - and this is true).
Then mum told me, "We'll pay for the wedding."
And I said "No, why would I go into debt to pay off a wedding for the next 20 years?" And also, knowing my parents couldn't afford it, I said, "Would I want to kill someone on the day I get married? (putting this massive debt on someone) Why would I want to cause anyone harm on the day I got married [by giving them a massive debt]?"
This was inside Meg and Ryan's old place in Dunedin.
And Meg said, "Come on, let's pick up some rubbish."
And I saw in my mind a picture "She is Proposingondor".

I will still not be goaded by demons.

No lie is of the truth, and in real life I do not know at all what the crypto I gave away would be worth.
At the same time, I will not marry anyone unless I'm delivered from demons and sanctified and God makes it explicitly clear
through an unambiguous message what His will is for me.
Dreams like this are not good enough, sorry.
I will not be goaded by a false-christ, nor by demons.

I rebuke the demonic harassment in Jesus Christ's name.
And once again, I pray to God in Jesus Christ's name that He will help me and set me free from this constant satanic opposition.

I have said it so many times. I need unambiguous guidance from God.
Even an angel speaking to me face to face and confessing Jesus.
And even then, I do not feel sanctified.
I feel like I'm oppressed by demons and have become corrupted as a result of ongoing demonic harassment. And I expect Jesus Christ to continue sanctifying me and deliver me from evil - that is something I ask Him for every single day. I feel like I was abandoned to Hades and that it corrupted me (this is what it currently feels like anyway), and so I'm waiting for deliverance.

At the same time, other very strange stuff has been going on in my day-to-day - stuff that is highly suspect, spiritually.
And the only right thing to do is to keep eyes on Jesus and not be misled, tempted or distracted by the devil.

Even right now at this moment, writing this, I feel like I'm under attack in my body/soul.
I want total cleansing and deliverance.

Also I still feel like I'm being affected by this spirit of Mormonism.
But I would say there are genuine Christians who may be Mormons.
Someone made a comment saying Luke (I love the Outdoor Boys channel btw) is a Mormon:
- [[https://www.youtube.com/shorts/_5kD1EIodBQ][youtube.com: The Outdoor Boys talk about Jesus Christ! ? #jesus #christian #celebrity #shorts {@RubenSolorzano_}]]
- [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HqhMk_IQ8tE][youtube.com: Luke from The Outdoor Boys talks about his Faith in Jesus Christ! {@RubenSolorzano_}]]
But all he's talking about here is Jesus Christ and His commandments.
I mean, Jesus sees the heart. He's the Judge.

Why have I been tormented/oppressed/harassed by demons? It's awful.
And on Monday just gone by this person who has said he is gay
confessed his faith to me saying that he believes the gnostic books.
God help me.
I asked him if he believes that Jesus is the Christ and the Son of God, and he
said yes. I also asked him if he believes that Jesus died for his sins and rose again. He impatiently said yes to that is as well.
He didn't make the confession from his own mouth asides from acknowledging my questions with a yes.
So I can't condemn him but neither can I see his heart.
I'm being pushed into these situations almost daily.
I think that Mormons, homosexuals and people believing heretical books
all need to turn away from those very things and be sanctified in God's Truth.
God help me.

** <2025-06-16 Mon>
Over the last week, I've been through so much tribulation.
Demons harassing me through people, even Christians.
Spirits not wanting to confess Jesus Christ is the Son of God.
This testimony may also come directly through other people.
That's because we regard noone according to the flesh anymore.
Something that is very affirming to me is when people confess directly to me that Jesus Christ is the Son of God.
I'm unsure why people very rarely do this. It's very strange.

I think it's really important to stick to my conviction regarding waiting for the promised voice and testimony of Jesus Christ from the the Holy Spirit in my heart.

I don't want to bear false testimony about Jesus, and so I want to be guided by a Spirit which testifies of Jesus.

Also, I feel as though the forced marriage-denial while enduring almost ceaseless demonic harassment for over 2 years,
and while also enduring not hearing the promised testimony of Jesus from the Holy Spirit
direct to my spirit, has been very damaging to my soul.
I am holding out for total sanctification and that testimony.

Also, how long does sanctification last?
Eternal life is at the end of sanctification and eternal life is knowing Jesus Christ and noone can have come to know Jesus Christ unless they keep His commandments, abiding in His love.
Being saved by obedience to Christ doesn't contradict in any way salvation through faith in Christ.
Salvation is the sanctification by the Holy Spirit, and by obedience to the Truth, obedience to Jesus.

I want to hear this testimony convincingly from Holy Spirit. And I want to not be waking up to demonic harassment:

    theologian from the last century, said,
    "The claim that God has
    spoken implies the trinity." And what he
    meant was if you say God has spoken,
    which is a basic biblical intuition,
    that means there must be in God a
    speaker, we call him the father, there
    must be a word spoken. We call that the
    son. And Bart says there must be an
    interpreter of the word. Why? Because
    the divine word, that's too much for our
    little minds to handle. So we need not a
    human interpreter. He's not going to
    help us with that. We need a divine
    interpreter of the divine word.

It's very important that I continue to remain faithful to the LORD, and endure to the end.
It's very important that I don't "sell-out" at the last moment.
I believe we must remain faithful to Lord Jesus, and endeavor to keep His commandments, and Jesus will give the rest at the point at which He does,
but along the way, I'm supposed to be holding faith in Jesus and obeying His commandments.

** <2025-06-22 Sun>
There's some extremely dodgy stuff happening with me, spiritually.
During my days, it seems like there are lying demons manipulating those around me.

I was woken up several times last night to extreme mental pressure against my mind trying to tempt me to not remain faithful to Jesus,
and in various situations through the day.
No spirit speaking to me (in these conversations in my sleep and in dreams and visions) made testimony of Jesus Christ.
They're often blasphemous, and trying to take my thoughts away from Jesus.
And all through the morning, even now <2025-06-22 Sun 12:42> midday, there's been this defilement of spirit trying to arouse me, move my genitals around and touch my lips. It's disgusting.
I am trying my best to resist satan and submit to God, focus on Jesus, trusting in, trusting and obeying Him.
That's what we're supposed to do.
Satan has been trying to derail me as I endeavour to do this, through sleep deprivation, miscommunication, slander, dream and soul-attacks.
I await the day of the Lord Jesus Christ, as I continue believe and trusting in Him.
I'm saved in that I am trusting in Jesus believing in Him and trusting in His blood, endeavouring to remain faithful to Him.
Now Christians are so often telling me things which might seem like they're trying to offer helpful and encouraging advice,
but the sheer volume of it as I'm striving to be faithful to Jesus, and be obedient to Jesus, 'appears' like I'm being attacked by Satan as they do this,
to try to derail my faith or mislead me, or to endorse sexual impurity, adultery, filthy talk, violence, etc.
It's bizarre. I'll quote Jesus and then it seems to arouse to anger Christians who have imprecise theology, Christians needing sanctification (and we all go through sanctification).
Or demons working through them might then start making these ad-hominem attacks against me bringing up sinful things from my past from before I was a spiritually regenerated new creation in Christ Jesu,
sinful stuff which demons no doubt had been trying to enslave me with and want to continue using to steal also the freedom
I have in Christ Jesus, the freedom to turn a new leaf and be walking in righteousness, by obedience to the Truth.
These types of comments often come through Christians.
Or pressure me to stop striving to obey Jesus while I'm under attack by satan.
Even if it's an issue of my faith specifically, rather than obedience, I'll still come under attack over my faith.

I have heard stuff through Christians in the last week which has not been encouraging me to not betray Jesus but rather, maybe them trying to be consoling in some way say things like, "We've all betrayed Jesus in some way." In the past I've heard, "It's not our own faith that matters, it's Jesus' faith. It's not our own obedience that matters, it's Jesus' obedience". And while there is an aspect of truth in this I still see these are half-truths, half-lies.

And the devil meanwhile attacks me as I commit to be faithful to Jesus, the devil sends temptation through dreams, deterrence through other Christians,
sleep deprivation with demons harassing me in my sleep, and attacks on my actual soul, my senses, etc. so that I'm just continually in a state of discomfort,
while I am endeavouring to remain faithful to Jesus.

So what I want to hear from Christians trying to encourage me is verbatim Scripture, and I most often am told things that simply aren't Scripture, they don't line up with Jesus and the Apostles' teachings.

Anyway, I'll finish today's journal entry saying that, Jesus is my Lord and Saviour.
I'm going to resist the devil's attempts to frame me as some kind of antichrist or betrayer of Jesus in the public which I think the devil had been trying to do (the devil has attacked me so hard through fellow Christians and also with the dream attacks etc. which have been so invasive and defiling),
and resist the devil's attempts to try to gaslight me, and to undermine and derail my faith.
Instead, I'm just going to continue believing in, trust in, believe, seek to obey faithfully to the best of my ability, with the hope of salvation.
I've been saved, I'm still saved (I have confidence because I still have my faith in Jesus and I'm loving to keep Jesus' commandments. I'm trying to get better at it), and I have hope to be saved in the future.

Jesus Christ my Lord, who is Jehovah God, the Son of God, the Lamb of God.

Jesus came on a rescue mission to save us. You should put your faith and trust in Him. Amen.

In this way did God agape love (treasure/value) the world, that He gave His
Only-Begotten Son that everyone who is trusting/believing in Him [may] not
perish, but [may] have life everlasting which is to be reconciled to our Creator
and His Son, in relationship with God forever, never perishing nor being cut
off from our source of life and all that is good.

    journey really needs to be met by just
    simple abiding in Jesus, and the experiential and
    existential reality of union and
    communion with Christ, and allowing for
    what our puritan forefathers spoke about
    as the testimony of the Holy Spirit to
    the heart, the touch. And so
    let me explain my theology of that,
    hoping this could encourage someone out
    there. I really believe the Holy Spirit
    has a ministry of assurance, and I never
    would have guessed would have guessed
    that the word assurance would be one of
    the terms that would be a whole tagline
    for what I'm trying to do in my ministry.
    But I actually think assurance is, number
    one it's possible, number two it's good.
    If someone pulls up Bible Gateway and
    does a search for the word 'assurance',
    they'll find that word a lot, even in the
    definition of faith in Hebrews 11, 1 John
    3 some wonderful words about how we
    reassure ourselves. I think assurance is
    a good thing and I just want to
    encourage people who are listening to
    this is a point our Catholic and
    Orthodox wonderful friends can agree
    with to a large degree. The Holy Spirit
    is in the business of the ministry of
    assurance. He is capable of
    supernaturally breathing, think of Alan
    breathing on the stone statues and
    Narnia and they come to life, He can do
    that to any human heart. Just as much as
    the ministry of Christ through His
    resurrection is this objective reality.
    The Holy Spirit, He's the most wonderful
    person to know. He can breathe on
    your heart and reassure you of the love
    of God, that you're a child of God. Romans
    8, the spirit testifies with our spirit
    so that we know we are children of God.

Amen!! I'm waiting for this "Holy Spirit to my spirit" testimony and the promised testimony of Jesus.

*** <2025-06-25 Wed> Tues and Wed I have had extreme spiritual attack
Evil dreams. Accusing, graphic, lewd dreams.
Unscriptural. Not confessing Jesus.
I caved in and succumbed a bit to the pressure.
Felt extremely spiritually drained.
I blamed God a bit for allowing me to be exposed to such intense spiritual attack for so long.

*** <2025-06-26 Thu> More dream attacks
Among other harassing dreams I have woken up to,
I had a 'pleasant' dream of being in a flying boat with a earthly family member doing circles over a catamaran in a harbour, and I looked outside  and someone was flying a car past with a trailing flag saying "grace is truth". Jesus was not confessed.

Jesus brought grace and truth, yes, but grace is misunderstood by people to mean, "let's just go back to the world to live in it as if it's heaven."

I hate satan and his deceptions.
Grace is for us to renounce ungodliness and be sanctified in the truth to live holy and loving lives.

On 2 April 2022 I was born-again of the Spirit.
On 3 May 2022 a spirit not confessing Jesus claimed to be the Holy Spirit.
But I confessed Jesus to them.
On 3 May 2023 I was in court pleading guilty for harassment because I did not want to cause harm to my neighbour, among other reasons.

I've been attacked by the devil so much after being born-again.
And because of my desire to be obedient to Jesus, people tell me stuff like, "I can't accept grace." which is a lie from the devil.

Just read your Bible and remain grounded in what the Scripture says, and put Jesus' words into practice, resist the devil and he will flee.

This morning I have managed to so far resist the devil's attacks quite well, praise God, and I'm feeling spiritually strong.
Yesterday was extremely tough.

    not by overpowering his enemies, but by
    forgiving them, by dying for them. This
    idea turns the idea of victory inside
    out and forces us to rethink what it
    really means to be truly strong. To be
    strong is to let go of your ego. To be
    strong is to live into self-sacrificial
    love for the sake of the other. Number
    two, the cross redefineses success. You
    see, for many, success is about climbing
    higher or achieving more things or
    avoiding pain altogether in our
    Epicurian society. But you see, the
    cross shows us that true glory is found
    in sacrificial love. The poetry of the
    cross, as Bishop Baron is talking about,
    is about embracing this reality. And one
    of those things, one of the things that
    happens within this reality is
    suffering, right? We experience
    suffering. But because we know that God
    loves us, we know that there's kind of a
    poetic justice to this suffering. Then
    ultimately, it's leading to the benefit
    of ourselves and of course the world at
    large.

Predictably, having been forced awake by demons at 7am this morning and having gone back to sleep,
I subsequently continued to receive a barrage of dreams and visions continually forcing me awake,
none of it confessed Jesus and I remember stuff in there which included temptation.
And now I have a headache.

So, yes, there was nothing to suggest that even the pleasant stuff was from God.
Nothing at all.
We have to keep Jesus' commandments and trust in God's word, and be corrected by His word, maintain faith to Jesus and seek to abide in the love which Jesus commanded and demonstrated.

** <2025-06-28 Sat>

What happened to me to cause such intense spiritual oppression to try to force me back into sin, to try to nullify the grace of God in my life?
What came against me, and continues to come against me to try to take my thoughts away from Jesus?

Even last night and this morning, more satanic/demonic harassment.
Forced awake at 5am/5:30am.
Why was such unreasonable pressure put on me over the last few years?
God knows, but it's unreasonable.
I've never heard of anything like this before.
Even in the church circles that I have been a part of, they had not been preaching forsaking sin, and keeping Jesus' commandments.
Being preached a different Jesus for such a long time and then relearning and discovering through reading my Bible myself (as a regenerate person) what the gospel really looks like, and what the will of God for us is... makes me puzzled.
It makes me question how and why it has been the case that churches skirt around the edges of Jesus' teachings when the majority of church attendees have probably never done a thorough read of them or recognise their importance,
at least among the places I've been to.
Obviously, I have to give due credit to God for allowing me to be in a position to study the Scriptures, and give due credit to God
for leading and guiding me. Praise God for that. The system clearly had failed for me, and God gave me time to study His Word.

Lots of stuff going on.
Extreme amounts of spiritual attack.
Plus interesting interactions with other believers.
But the fact is I haven't heard yet any testimony of Jesus through dreams or visions.
I get plenty of dreams and visions. I can't trust them.
They can be incredibly deceptive, but I already drew a line in the sand. I wont
trust any spirit which does not make a testimony of Jesus and confesses elementary doctrine of Christ until I'm satisified.
Right up to today, I've received a huge amount of spiritual attack in my sleep,
and throughout my days, testing and trials continually.

So in the morning, once again I get slammed with harassing and evil dreams and visions. And I'm getting attacked all through the morning.

I resist sin and do a Bible study and have breakfast and I play a video game later in the day.

So I got annoyed with someone who was on my team just provoking me, and eventually I raged a bit and said something back. I said what they did was a dumb thing to do. I didn't need to backbite, but I did. I don't think it was a loving thing to do to respond how I did.

It's such a petty little thing for me to get upset over, and some people might say what I did wasn't that bad,
but I was convicted by it, especially since I've been telling people recently to put on love.
I guess it's obvious I could improve at loving those who hate me.

Be angry and do not sin is what the Bible says.

Actually, I was dumb for backbiting. And it made me feel awful afterwards.
Like after telling people, we've got to love those who hate us, and then not practicing what I said.
I confess what I did as sin and may God forgive me.
It might seem like a tiny thing but it weighed pretty heavily on my conscience today.
If I see them again and remember then I will apologise to them.

Now I believe that if I confess sin as sin, then that is part of what it means to be walking in the light.

** <2025-07-11 Fri>

I've had an extreme amount of testing (through other people) and spiritual attack.

When it comes to being saved, I just want to say a few things.

I was seeking God through 2021 but I needed a new heart which would fear God and love Him and want to please Him, want to stop sinning,
want to be corrected by His Word, His Scripture, wants to remain faithful to Him.

And I called out to God for Him to make Himself real to me, and He made me born-again.
I was born-again of the Spirit in 2022.
God regenerated my spirit, and He gave me a new heart, a heart of flesh, and put the fear of Him in me so that I would keep His commandments.
So it's all grace.
Even before God regenerated my spirit, I was in grace.
But I know it's important now, extremely important to trust and obey Jesus Christ, and trust and obey His Word, trust and obey the Holy Scripture.
It's important even for salvation to remain in Him.
I know that.
Don't let anyone tell you we don't have to continue in faith, love and hope, and obedience to God,
but we need a new heart and a new spirit in order to do all of that willfully.
And we must not turn from God.
God wants worshipers who worship Him in reality, in spirit and in Truth.

God help me.

For the sake of the Kingdom, we may choose to be single. I'm certainly not against this. Whatever God wills for me. Whether God gives me a wife or God gives me the gift of singleness, I must seek first the Kingdom of God and His Righteousness and God will do what is best for me. Sometimes because of the "spirit"-spouse stuff, I feel like I'm dying. I want whatever is best for the Kingdom of God. God guide me. I will not force anything. In Jesus Christ's name, AMEN.

Called to consecrate themselves with undivided heart to the Lord and to "the affairs of the Lord", they give themselves entirely to God and to men. Celibacy is a sign of this new life to the service of which the Church's minister is consecrated; accepted with a joyous heart celibacy radiantly proclaims the Reign of God. In the Eastern Churches a different discipline has been in force for many centuries: while bishops are chosen solely from among celibates, married men can be ordained as deacons and priests. This practice has long been considered legitimate; these priests exercise a fruitful ministry within their communities. Moreover, priestly celibacy is held in great honor in the Eastern Churches and many priests have freely chosen it for the sake of the Kingdom of God. In the East as in the West a man who has already received the sacrament of Holy Orders can no longer marry.

+ [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vl8ziU0iqeE][youtube.com: Four Tests for False Teaching {@desiringGod}]] :: Those are some good tests.

    Breastplate of righteousness = breastplate of faith and agape love. So we should be living with a love for the Truth. We believe the gospel and we love God's Word, we love Jesus Christ. Demons may believe but they don't love the Truth. They don't love Jesus. They don't want to be around Him. I believe faith, agape love, hope, obedience (desiring to do the will of God, desiring to do what God wants us to do, desiring to do what God has commanded) are all in the heart. We need God to give us a new heart that fears Him and clings to Him for life, trust His word, desires to please Him, and wants to be around Him, wants to get closer to Him. God gives us a new heart and a new spirit so we can do His will, so it's all grace. Justified by faith alone means justified not of our own works, but through faith in Jesus Christ. Anyone who has faith in Jesus Christ has the right to become a child of God. That means, they have the right to be cleaned up by Jesus Christ's blood so that they can be set free from sin, and practice righteousness. God will clean us up through sanctification through faith, sanctification through obedience to the Truth. God helps us put a stop to sin, love one another, and practice righteousness. Yes, salvation is through sanctification and faith in Jesus Christ. So we must go on in faith and obedience to Jesus Christ, coming into agreement with God's Word, and in obedience to Christ. And it has to be a lawful keeping of Christ's commandments, so we must agape-love God out of our whole heart, with all our soul, with all our mind and all our strength, and agape-love our neighbour as ourself. It's our duty to keep God's commandments, and God gives us a new heart to be able to do our duty.
    
    Re: justification by faith alone, at the bottom of it, it's trust in Jesus Christ in our heart, and we don't merely believe the truth, but love the truth, and we trust Jesus, and we trust Father God. So we're correctable by the Word. We trust the word even before we understand it. This faith is a clinging, an adherance to the truth, trusting the truth, it's a trusting of the Word of God, trusting Jesus Christ Himself.
    
    Obedience, is a desire to do (a will to do) what God wants us to do, and obedience is also actually doing what God has commanded. At the base of it, it's all in the heart:
    
    *[[https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20John%203%3A17&version=ESV][I John 3:17]]* - But if anyone has the world's goods and sees his brother in need, yet closes his heart against him, how does God's love abide in him? (ESV)
    
    *[[https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=James%202%3A14&version=ESV][James 2:14]]* - What good is it, my brothers, if someone says he has faith but does not have works? Can that faith save him? (ESV)
    
    So Jesus commands us to have faith in Him. If we have faith in Jesus we are obedient to that commandment.
    If we're trusting Jesus we're obedient to that commandment.
    Obedience covers so much stuff.
    Paul wants us to try to be obedient in all things, even until our obedience is complete.
    At the bottom of it, we arrive at a heart that just loves doing what God has commanded us to do as Christians!
    So that heart of obedience is what we have that enables us to produce works that are pleasing to God.

+ [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vl8ziU0iqeE][youtube.com: Four Tests for False Teaching {@desiringGod}]] :: God gives us a new heart which fears Him and is able to be corrected by Him.
    And then we do go through correction, even after being born again, born of the Spirit.
    We are disciplined even after being given the new heart which fears God.
    Receiving correction from Jesus is extremely important.
    Because God continues working on our heart.
    With that new heart of flesh that fears God, God may then humble us, me may test us, he continues to work on our heart after we receive the new heart, until we simply love to keep His commandments, and they're not burdensome to us.
    Through testing, and discipline, our hearts are transformed. So we receive a new heart but God continues working on it.
    
    Loving God and one another is our duty:
    
    *[[https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ecclesiastes%2012%3A13&version=ESV][Ecclesiastes 12:13]]* - The end of the matter; all has been heard. Fear God and keep his commandments, for this is the whole duty of man. (ESV)
    
    *[[https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2022%3A36-40&version=ESV][Matthew 22:36-40]]* - Teacher, which is the great commandment in the Law? And he said to him, You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind. This is the great and first commandment. And a second is like it: You shall love your neighbor as yourself. On these two commandments depend all the Law and the Prophets. (ESV)
    
    Even Jesus Christ's commandments depend on the 2 Great Commandments, so as far as I understand we have to do Jesus' commandments lawfully and that means as we follow Jesus' commandments, that shouldn't violate the 2 Great Commandments. So in Christ we must also keep these 2 Great Commandments. That means we must agape-love God and agape love our neighbor as ourself. So even when we think about keeping God's commandments, such as to have faith in Jesus Christ, we must be doing this while at the same time agape-loving God and at the same time agape-loving our neighbour as ourself. Agape love is a treasuring/valuing/preserving/compassion love and God the Father and Jesus God the Son should be our first agape love, and those in the family of Christ we must also agape love, and our spouses we must agape love and we are even called to agape all people, but we're supposed to have no agape for this world:
    
    *[[https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2022%3A36-40&version=ESV][Matthew 22:36-40]]* - Teacher, which is the great commandment in the Law? And he said to him, You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind. This is the great and first commandment. And a second is like it: You shall love your neighbor as yourself. On these two commandments depend all the Law and the Prophets. (ESV)
    
    *[[https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20John%205%3A1-2&version=ESV][I John 5:1-2]]* - Everyone who believes that Jesus is the Christ has been born of God, and everyone who loves the Father loves whoever has been born of him. By this we know that we love the children of God, when we love God and obey his commandments. (ESV)
    
    Breastplate of righteousness = breastplate of faith and love. A heart of love, a heart that trusts God, a heart that wants to please God, a heart of obedience desiring to do the things God has commanded us to do, produces good deeds. God wants us to want to do His will, not merely do it but want to do it.
    
    *[[https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Thessalonians%205%3A8&version=ESV][I Thessalonians 5:8]]* - But since we belong to the day, let us be sober, having put on the breastplate of faith and love, and for a helmet the hope of salvation. (ESV)
    
    *[[https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20John%203%3A23-24&version=ESV][I John 3:23-24]]* - And this is his commandment, that we believe in the name of his Son Jesus Christ and love one another, just as he has commanded us. Whoever keeps his commandments abides in him, and he in them. And by this we know that he abides in us, by the Spirit whom he has given us. (ESV)
    
    *[[https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians%206%3A14&version=ESV][Ephesians 6:14]]* - Stand therefore, having fastened on the belt of truth, and having put on the breastplate of righteousness, (ESV)
    
    God turns us into doers of His word.
    
    *[[https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=James%201%3A19-23&version=ESV][James 1:19-23]]* - Know this, my beloved brothers: let every person be quick to hear, slow to speak, slow to anger; for the anger of man does not produce the righteousness that God requires. Therefore put away all filthiness and rampant wickedness and receive with meekness the implanted word, which is able to save your souls. But be doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving yourselves. For if anyone is a hearer of the word and not a doer, he is like a man who looks intently at his natural face in a mirror. (ESV)
    
    Draw near to God and He'll draw near to you, absolutely.
    If we seek out God, like through repentance, through trust, through, holding confidence, through taking steps of faith, through obedience to Jesus Christ, any of that, if we seek out God, we will find. Just gotta continue.
    
    
    Yes, God makes us born-again, gives us a new heart which fears Him and then He still continues working on us, and still continues working on our hearts, and we're supposed to strive in trusting and obeying God and God continues correcting and transforming us. We should keep pressing in to God.
    
    And at the end we just love to do what God wants us to do.
    And we love God, Father, Son and Holy Spirit, for who God is.
    Jesus Christ is High King of Heaven.
    That's really awesome.

*** Journal <2025-07-12 Sat>
When I was born-again of the spirit on 2 April 2022, God gave me a new heart which feared Him and was able to receive correction from Him.
I didn't have all the answers.
I didn't have great theology.
But God would teach me.
In other words, He would write His laws on my heart,
and help me to abide in Christ's commandments.

I truly do despair of life as it is right now.
Against my understanding, I have been terrorised by demons - being punished and tormented without knowing why.
I've just been continually trying to understand why.
And of course, satan has huge numbers of accusations and reasons which he tries to make be believe.

If I'm in the kingdom of God then I feel like a package moving around a busy sorting facility, constantly being tested
and sorted, without end. I've felt constantly under constraint, deprived of sleep, woken up by demons - a messenger of Satan, I think.
And it feels like in my soul, the body of sin, the flesh, is trying to usurp and kill the new creation, and the people around me also placing such unreasonable pressure on me to obey the flesh and to not live in the spirit.
In other words, pressuring me to think like the world thinks, rather than to have the mind of Christ.

And where is the promised testimony of the Holy Spirit as I seek to keep Christ's commandments and abide in His teachings?

I feel like I'm dying sometimes, dying spiritually, losing the fight against the enemy who attacks my soul and attacks me through people around me.

I want to be set free, as Jesus Christ promised for those who He sets free.
I know Jesus bought me but sadly it seems He allowed me to be absolutely terrorised by demons.

Requiring employment/world's assets before marriage proposal is evil, as to require it puts man's kingdom above God's kingdom.
Because to do so would be saying that people have to have what the world says qualifies a person before they have the right to what God freely gave us.
It would be like telling a bird it's allowed to fly only if it can qualify as a human pilot.
It would be like telling a person they don't have a right to become a child of God through faith in Jesus Christ.
It would be like hating Jesus Christ, the Light of the world, so putting Him to death on a tree.
Denying what is given to us as a right is anti-God.

Do I have the right to ask?
Most of the trees in the Garden of Eden, Adam and Eve were freely allowed to eat.
What is permissible. What is unhelpful?
What are my freedoms?

I'm not under Mosaic Law.
I'm not under man's tradition.
I'm under Christ's Law and Grace and Truth came through Jesus Christ. All Christ's commandments are Grace and Truth!
That means I'm under grace and under Christ's Law at the same time! ([[https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah%2041%3A1-4&version=ESV][Isaiah 41:1-4]], Romans 15:12, Matthew 12:19-21, Isaiah 11:10)

Under Christ's Law, I'm allowed to propose marriage if I'm doing it lawfully, receiving with thanksgiving, knowing the truth,
while keeping God's Great Commandments, while holding faith in Jesus Christ, while following Jesus Christ, while keeping Christ's Law with a good conscience.

I can't claim total [[https://selfdenial.org.nz/][self-denial]] with this one. So I can't claim perfect innocence.

I was simply told by a member of their family, "Any further contact (with them) is unlawful."
If I told someone, "It's unlawful to talk to some person.", does that make it unlawful?
Do they have that right to tell me what is lawful or not?
I wanted to marry someone (and I don't think I'd told any of them at that stage), and I was told before revealing my desire that "any further contact with any member of their family was unlawful" (not from a police officer) at the time.

And I was born-again of the spirit.
Was I born-again of the spirit after or before being told that any further contact is unlawful? Pretty sure it was after, but not certain, as didn't make a record.
I was made into a new person. New creation. Then I made contact and proposed later in the year.
I was born-again and simply became preoccupied with Jesus Christ and later that year I proposed.
Even after being born-again, I was simply gutted at the thought of not hearing from her again. I was aware even after being born-again of the spirit (made new) that I was told before revealing my desire that "Any further contact is unlawful" by a member of their family.
To not propose to her would feel like destroying something very pure.

Later, I proposed to her but I was taken to court over it.
Anyway, at pleading guilty, I committed my way to the Lord Jesus Christ, and I felt like I wasn't allowed to move forward even after I committed my way.

One court judge said I must have been baptised at midnight. The other court judge said "That is your opinion" in response to me saying that "Jesus is the Truth" in a letter to him. And he said that I'm not allowed to forgive.
But I pleaded guilty effectively to harassment for exercising free speech (2 out of 3 of the brail breaches claims from my perspective were not lawful but I couldn't take the other side to trial because I didn't want to hurt her, rather I still had lots of joy over proposing, but as soon as court proceeding started, I truly didn't want to break the law. The bail breach claims from my perspective were unlawful. I didn't really know it was her who was distressed, but I didn't want to cause her any distress.
I had no fear over punishment at all. I didn't care about career. To take them to trial would waste their time and money and it would not be exercising Christ's love if I were to take them to trial over it. The first bail breach was the only valid one from my memory. But the same time, it was graceless. I breach bail for asking, "Can I try ask again in a year?" after a police officer simply said, "The smartest thing I can do is just drop it", just after I had proposed marriage. Like the Terminator arriving at my door after having proposed to the love of my life. And so I broke bail the first time for asking again if I could ask in a year. I guess I have a human heart. Can I be taken to prison for that, proposing while under unreasonable constraint? Probably only by a system which is anti-human) and neither was I forcing someone to marry me, simply making an offer.

Now, in committing to that path of going my separate ways, I have had immense pressure from other people and through demonic dreams, to renege on that commitment.

I need God to set me free from satanic oppression over my life.

I feel like God would betray me to force me to find secular employment before having a wife.
Why? Because I had put Jesus first before marriage.
It feels like having to hold my breath and resist the urge to breath in 'dying' to that marriage proposal.
And after doing so I would see it as purely evil to not allow me to move forward on that commitment to move forward.
To hold me in this position would be like to not even allow a person to die while drowning at the bottom of the ocean, a person who was there in the first place because they didn't want to harm their neighbour.

However I'm totally willing to work for God as Adam did before God made Eve, that's fine.
Man is espoused to Christ first. Christ the head of the man, and man the head of the wife.
Not the Pope as head of the man, but Christ Himself as head of the man.

Whatever has happened to me has been grossly lacking in grace.

I have no desire at all to ever propose to anyone else ever again.
I want all my memories to be erased.
I want God to honour His own words and send Holy Spirit to make testimony of Jesus Christ to me.

Just to be clear, this ball rests in God's courts. I feel as though I have not been fairly delt with by God, and if I have a bone to pick with anyone, it is only with God.

** Journal <2025-07-26 Sat>
I confess yesterday I got very upset with the Lord Jesus in my prayers.
I have had such heavy spiritual attack.
I don't understand it.
And sometimes I've put the blame on the Lord.
But God knows I love Him, and I have my hope set on Him.

Almost every single night I've been getting hit with such antichrist dreams and visions.
Antichrist. Literally, demons/satan putting evil in my mind as I'm sleeping.
Pure darkness. Stuff that is anti-God, anti-Christ, adulterous, lying, harassing dreams and visions.

And on top of that, the collective pressure on me, through spirit-spouse stuff, or so-called Christians refusing to help me, as I strive obediently to Jesus, and suffer for it.
It's very isolating, and sometimes the pressure gets to me.

The pressure of resistance against me as I try to live for righteousness (in the way God wants me to) feels like being an infant holding up a church building while all the adults flee/ turn a blind eye, or like the man in the story of the "Good Samaritan" who's bean beaten and left for dead on the side of the road needing to save himself and all the "Christians" turn a blind eye.

I may feel as though I'm in a "spiritual prison" feeling unable to work and marry.
But I want to be completely delivered from the true spiritual prison which is sin.
Sin is a spiritual prison.

Even Simon the magician believed and was baptised but it is evident that even the Apostle Peter recognised that Simon might perish. As far as I can tell Simon had not yet received Holy Spirit. His heart still wasn't right. Just like Simon, we must receive the love of the truth in our heart to be saved. Simon was instructed to *repent from sin*. While true agape love is the bond of perfection, I think the bond of iniquity might mean a love of darkness. Simon had to relinquish his sinful desire. Likewise, the rich young ruler (in [[https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark%2010%3A17-27&version=ESV][Mark 10:17-27]]) had a love of worldly possessions. We need to agape love the truth and fall out of love of darkness. Even as believers, we need to continue on in the teachings of Christ to be saved:

Now when the apostles at Jerusalem heard that Samaria had received the word of God, they sent to them Peter and John, who came down and prayed for them that they might receive the Holy Spirit, for he had not yet fallen on any of them, but they had only been baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus. Then they laid their hands on them and they received the Holy Spirit. Now when Simon saw that the Spirit was given through the laying on of the apostles' hands, he offered them money, saying, Give me this power also, so that anyone on whom I lay my hands may receive the Holy Spirit. But Peter said to him, May your silver perish with you, because you thought you could obtain the gift of God with money! *You have neither part nor lot in this matter, for your heart is not right before God.* *Repent*, therefore, of this wickedness of yours, and pray to the Lord that, if possible, the intent of your heart may be forgiven you. For I see that you are in the gall of bitterness and in *the bond of iniquity*. (ESV)

Jesus' words are true. As I understand it, probably Simon Magus "had" salvation when he believed and was baptised but salvation is a process and as Jesus says, the devil steals the word from a person's heart so that they do not believe. So a person must continue in true faith. As I currently understand it, we also must not "fall away". We must endure in our faith. Simon Magus needed to repent from sin to receive Holy Spirit and in order to continue on in true justifying faith in Jesus, as I understand it:

I've been getting hit real hard with spiritual attacks.
Dreams that are anti Jesus Christ, and trying to temp me into fantasizing about sexual immorality, and this defilement which tries to arouse my body.

This morning at 3.00am I woke up to demonic dreams, one that was trying to tempt me to fantasise, and the feeling of some spirit occupying the interior of my left leg and all around the private area.

I don't see it as fair at all that I come under such heavy spiritual attack,
given relationship/marriage and job denial etc. and these crazy accusations of sexual immorality by harassing demonic dreams to get bombarded with these utterly satanic dreams during the night it's just disgusting and not right.

They're unwelcome.

Jesus Christ help me. I don't know why this is happening.

I believe that Jesus Christ who is the Son of God bled and died for my sins.

It's the afternoon.
I feel as though Father God may have led someone to talk to me today.
I just pray for them that my testimony of Jesus saving me, making me born-again, will have a positive impact on them. That the Holy Spirit will lead them into all truth, and that they will just have a love of Jesus Christ, and learn to keep Jesus' commandments better.

Dear Heavenly Father and my Lord Jesus Christ and Holy Spirit,
Jehovah, Almighty God,
Lord, help the person who talked to me today to abide in Christ's commandments and help me also,
and help them to not bear a grudge, and I ask the same for me.
Lord Jesus Christ, I can't live like this.
I want to be healed and restored.
I've asked You countless times, LORD God.
Countless times.
Countless times, really believing that if I don't receive deliverance that it'd be my destruction.
When literally satan and his demons attack my mind, and relationships, and my body/soul etc. I feel violated and depressed and I feel like sometimes I'm not strong enough to resist the enemy's attacks.
Sincerely, Jesus Christ, I believe that You need to heal me and protect me, and follow through with Your promise that Holy Spirit will testify of You to me, to those who abide in Your word, and keep Your commandments.
Sincerely, I do not believe I have had sufficient grace at all to protect me from what's happened.
I've been born-again and what happened after that is the stuff of nightmares and horror stories.
I hope I don't have to live with these memories.
So please, God, help me Jesus Christ.
I believe You bled and died for my sins and rose for my justification.
How can You let me perish when I'm trusting in You?
Don't let me perish but heal me and protect my soul.
In Jesus Christ's name, I ask,
AMEN!!

    - I feel like from time to time are demons entering and exiting my body frequently, or something like that,
      - these demons have been violating me mentally and sexually.
      - sometimes during the day when I'm less vulnerable because I'm awake
      - I've been getting these attacks daily for over 2 years, and I'm feeling weak.
  - Leave the house, help people asking for help on the street
  - Do Bible studying
  - Practice handwriting
  - Spend lots of time thinking about Jesus' teachings
  - Journal
  - Maybe a little emacs programming
  - Play some Cute Defense on StarCraftII
  - Feed my cat twice a day
  - Every night I go to bed trusting in Jesus, trusting Him to keep me safe.
    - But almost every single night without fail, there is so much demonic oppression going on.
  - Almost every time I sit down, I get spiritual attack. Feel like there is a spiritual defilement in my lower body.
  - A ringing in my ears that is triggered when I am tested spiritually (such as through someone asking a question) and subsequently say something / respond to it.
  - Always under the pump financially. Always. If I have money then someone is extremely likely going to ask me for help somehow.
    - Yet, following Christ's commandments has to be done lawfully.
      - Must be done in love, for example.
      - Must be done in faith.
      - Must take care of dependents.
  - I'd be working but I've been denied work. Yet I love doing as Jesus commanded and being the good Samaritan.
  - My joy is coming almost entirely right now from maintaining a good conscience with Jesus and having a relationship with Jesus, following His commandments, i.e. having a real relationship with Jesus.
- People refuse to give me work. They very often "ghost" me. They go dead silent.
  - I blame literally demons actually manipulating other people into doing that by various means
- On a Sunday I often have nice conversations with people. But given the reality of having been born-again, having first hand evidence of the supernatural, of being born-again of the Spirit, and where I'm literally having to live by Christ's teachings/commandments, walking in the Spirit, rather than being worldly-minded, I often see worldly thinking, and compromise within the church walls. Very often.
  - Everything feels like "hard-mode". Like where is the grace for me to be able to live?
- With regards to people I know who I'm close to,
  - I have seen vastly different sides to people
    - Like different people in the same body.
      - I had written this off to one version of a person which listens to Jesus / speaks the truth about God, and another which doesn't, and I'd taken the latter to be "the flesh". Like when a person speaks from the flesh and does not want to listen to God's Word.
      - But honestly, I don't really know what's going on. It just seems like I've seen too much stuff which a regular person shouldn't normally know about of have seen.


There's simply stuff I have seen which I wish that I had not have seen.
God help me.

I honestly don't know how to be delivered from this (well, the bad stuff).
There is good stuff amongst it.
But I feel like I need desperately Jesus to deliver me from evil, heal and sanctify me, and speak to me.
And I feel like I need other Christians to be assisting me instead of turning a blind eye to me.


I need more than just a little bit of reassurance that God's working behind the scenes.
I need Jesus Christ to speak clearly to me, to assure me, encourage me, to let me hear the testimony which Holy Spirit gives concerning Himself (Jesus).
I need deliverance.
I need protection at night.
I need guidance.
I need healing.
I need my soul to be knit back together.
I need grace.
God knows I've asked Him for grace, and for all these things.
Imagine asking God for such things every day, and going to sleep trusting in Him to take care of You, then getting woken up to demons putting stuff in your mind and invading your body.
It's violating on so many levels.
I don't think this is a matter of me being more humble anymore.
I bend over backwards trying to please God, and He lets all this stuff happen to me.
I don't understand why.
Then when stuff gets to me and I succumb to temptation, the spiritual attack I receive intensifies.
It's really horrific being me right now.
Jesus save me.


To whoever's listening. Whatever happened to me felt like crucifying love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, self-control,
99% fruit of the spirit got crucified. And then I now feel like having being washed clean, made brand new, Satan tried to destroy me after I got born-again.
Don't get me wrong, I still had some issues, but I had love in my heart for everyone. I didn't want to hurt anyone.
Satan tried to destroy me after I got born-again.
But I had so much joy and peace and faith in God - so much of it, in 2022, despite a lot of self-denial which at times I had peace of mind over with but could really get me down.
Now my daily/nightly existence is a nightmare.
Where am I now under heaven? Feels like I've been put in an evil, demon-infested, version of earth after getting born-again, and it feels very defiling and I don't want to be here.

For the desires of the flesh are against the Spirit, and the desires of the Spirit are against the flesh, for these are opposed to each other, to keep you from doing the things you want to do. But if you are led by the Spirit, you are not under the law. Now the works of the flesh are evident: sexual immorality, impurity, sensuality, idolatry, sorcery, enmity, strife, jealousy, fits of anger, rivalries, dissensions, divisions, envy, drunkenness, orgies, and things like these. I warn you, as I warned you before, that those who do such things will not inherit the kingdom of God. But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, self-control; against such things there is no law. And those who belong to Christ Jesus have crucified the flesh with its passions and desires. If we live by the Spirit, let us also walk by the Spirit.

I am utterly sick of the way in which the so-called Christians around me refuse to give me the confession that Jesus Christ has come [into the world, from God] in the flesh.
When I've asked for it, I've been met with comments like, "Why do I need to tell you?"
I'd say that the spirit of antichrist has been working in those situations.
For the people who have specifically refused to give me that confession, I can't say that they are my family in Christ.
I can't say they are my family in Christ because my family in Christ would confess that Jesus Christ has come [into the world, from God] in the flesh.
They would confess that, because they love Jesus.
But I ask Father God that the people who have refused to make this confession to me, that they may come around to freely making this confession of the truth when asked.
And I pray for myself, that I can be delivered from continually brushing up against people who have the spirit of antichrist.

If we are "in the Spirit" then what other people confess or refuse to confess identifies whether or not the spirit working through them is from God. The principle can and should be used to test dreams, visions, angels, demons and human beings to see if we can trust them. I would never trust someone completely who refuses to give me this testimony:

I don't want to be in a world with AI. Please help me Jesus Christ and get me out of this world.
I don't want to be forced into being around people who worship demons and people who say they believe in Jesus but who do not believe they need to confess, turn away from and forsake sin, and who do not believe they need to love their family in Christ.
For some reason, when I pray and ask God to be delivered from such situations, and make a concerted effort to be corrected by the Scripture and to turn away from and forsake sinful stuff, and to denounce sinful stuff, and antichrist religion, I have found that I'm made to run into the types of people who have not turned away from such things. I'm really exhausted and I feel like I've run out of patience.
I've been crying out to God continually, basically daily, for about 2 years now, and I haven't been delivered.
I've still been getting these absolutely satanic dreams at night time.
What I've gone through is not acceptable.
Demonic harassment is not the inheritance that I hope in Jesus Christ for.
LGBT, AI world is not the inheritance that I hope in Jesus Christ for.
And I wouldn't trade my inheritance for anything this world can offer.
I wouldn't trade it.
When I pray to God and ask Him for help, when I ask Him to set me free from whatever demonic oppression has been preventing me from working and marrying, from whatever demonic oppression has been attacking my mind and soul, and when the devil then tries to frame marriage as an idol, I question God as to why, just why would He allow satan to be doing that to me.
I'm not going to live here in this world, I refuse, under these conditions.
Even still, to remain here certainly feels like remaining aboard a sinking ship.
I don't want to be in this world.
I want Jesus Christ to return.
I want to be raptured ([[https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g726/kjv/tr/0-1/][harpaz≈ç]]).
God help me.

Every day now it seems is a Psalm 88 day.
And why God thinks it's OK to not speak to me, but instead allow antichrist spirits to barrage me with dreams, deprive me of sleep, etc.
and bring me into contact with people who are unrepentant, and why God allows my soul to literally get attacked by this disgusting defilement.
It's actually not OK.
I'm literally lying here and I'm under spiritual attack. I can feel it in my blood.
I'm very much not OK with what has been made to happen to me.
Jesus Christ never let me have a family, but puts me through a living hell on earth.
That much is understandable as He said His followers would have tribulation in this world.
The one thing I refuse to let slide is this demonic harassment in my sleep, while God goes SILENT on me.
That's not OK.
I don't care if David also recorded this issue with God's silence in [[https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalms%2088%3A14&version=ESV][Psalms 88:14]] because demons have been harassing me at the same time.
Any dream I receive, no matter how "pleasant" it might be, if it doesn't confess Jesus Christ, I rebuke it and rebuke the author of it in Jesus Christ's name.
The author of any dream which doesn't confess Jesus, I condemn.
That demon spirit which doesn't confess Jesus Christ can burn in hell, for invading my mind and soul.
Also, Jesus has to fulfill His promise.
He promised Holy Spirit would testify of Him.
I demand this testimony.

So I've just woken up to more spiritual attack.
Something had been giving me evil dreams and visions,
and also my soul getting attacked.
Feeling as though a spirit is trying to have sex with me.
It feels like there is a spirit which clings to my lips/tongue and genital area.
I woke up this morning to evil dreams, and aroused and demoralised,
with no job, with no wife, and no money, and with stress on my mind.
With feeling like I'm constantly under the pump.
I pray that God hears those around the world who are suffering as I'm suffering, and I ask God to do something about it.

I get attacked by demons almost every day, and at the same time God seems to be ignoring me, and Jesus hasn't yet provided the testimony of Himself through Holy Spirit to my heart.
What I'm expecting is an audible voice or dream or something making the testimony to me in my mind.
That's what I'm expecting, and I haven't heard it.

I believe that the Apostle Paul was also being terrorised by such an evil spirit:

All through the night I was attacked with evil dreams and visions,
and what sometimes feels like mind control (what feels like me thinking and something something in a dream, until I snap out of it).
I was forced awake to evil dreams and visions maybe 10-20 times, all through the night, and it essentially all antichrist stuff,
and none of it confessed Jesus.

However, I responded in one of these dreams saying that "controlling one's own body is their spiritual act of worship".

I believe that with faith in Jesus if I am holding fast to the gospel and at the same time practicing Jesus' works, denying self, doing good, sharing the word of God, and striving for holiness, especially agreeing with God with what He thinks is good and hating wickedness, even though I might fall short, still confessing sin as sin, and hating the sin, and leaning on the righteousness of God, faith in the blood of Jesus, rather than my own righteousness as I endeavour to keep Jesus' works, striving to be faithful with unrighteous wealth, then whilst I might receive tribulation, I believe that most likely that results in influencing the world as God listens to my prayers.

Alternatively, who do they believe in and trust? Do they believe in and trust God, or do they believe in and trust AGI/ASI?
Do they fear God? Or do they fear AGI/ASI?
I have absolutely no fear of AGI/ASI.
It's of the world.
When people try to use AI to judge me / criticise me while I have been born-again and have a real relationship with God and I fear God and want to do what please Him, I just know that the AI stuff is detached from reality, propolled by greed and idolatry and I know I'm being persecuted for righteousness-sake.
I don't want to be in this world.
I have no love for it.

Life's impossible.
Jesus Christ lets me get attacked by demons every single day.
I'm in this really messed-up situation where:
- I've been denied work and thus have a large student no-interest loan, and born-again of the spirit and wanting to pay it of but also obey Jesus Christ and do as the good Samaritan to people
- How can it be OK that I get born-again in a situation where I'm not allowed to obey God?
- I'm literally in debt and demons harass me about money. I give even though I don't have a job and I'm denied employment
- My earthly parents put pressure on me as well
- I'm literally getting attacked by this spirit of antichrist. The satantic oppression against me is horrendous.
- Today it was more Hindu dreams and visions, stuff promoting Hinduism and against Jesus. Why does God allow this stuff? It's disgusting. May Christ make it end for His reputation

In John 17, Jesus prayed for His disciples that they would be protected by the evil one.
Since I still come under immense spiritual attack, but am in the world, it seems like either:
- God keeps me in the world and protects me, or
- God raptures me.
But to keep me in the world but not protect me is not what Jesus prayed for, so seems to be against what is right.
- I'm repentant but getting harassed by satan basically daily
- My parents also like to argue and harass me

God's put what feels like impossible demands on me regarding faith and holiness but is unwilling to speak clearly and plainly to me to guide me.
I'm reliant on the Scripture alone and hopefully Holy Spirit leading me.
But, very strangely, God seems unwilling to grant what He promises through His word, that is the testimony of Jesus Christ from Holy Spirit.

I feel like I'm always under spiritual attack almost continually.
I feel like a lot of protestant churches do preach faith alone but not together with repentance and holiness and that's when often I come under spiritual attack by people who are into new age, etc. and hinduism, for example, and when demons attack me.
Also getting harassed/accused about stuff from my past when I'm repentant.
God Almighty, when a person gets born-again of the spirit and baptised as an appeal for a good conscience and is regenerate and repentant but
is being prevented from, denied from walking in freedom as a forgiven person, then that is antichrist.

I can relate strongly to feeling abandoned by God.
And I can't relate strongly to feeling as though God is being faithful to me.
That's just the state of things.

I have faith in God and faith in Jesus Christ and endeavour to keep a good conscience and be obedient to God.
But it seems strongly to me from experience as though God is willing to push me beyond what I can handle to the point, while I tell Him it's more than I can handle.
For sure, I pray to Him in advance of breaking point. Yet, God doesn't seem to respect at all my limits.
That's just facts.

Christians are commanded to obey their parents *in the Lord*.
If my parents are not walking by the spirit, I don't think that commandment applies at that instance.
We must obey God rather than man.

+At this point, telling God to set me free and protect me from spiritual attack, if He does not do that, then He can't expect me to walk in the ways He's commanded. I'm sick of being abused by God.+

The amount of demonic harassment I've received in my sleep over the last few days in staggering. I won't go into details.

As a person who has been writing about theology online after being born-again and doing my best to resist heresies, I have experienced a lot of testing on theology, temptation and tribulation and maybe, just maybe, one of the reasons I've received so much of it is because I have been so vocal about such things and because I have been trying to keep Jesus' works as I do this.
I don't want to blame God.
I don't understand what's going on.
My hope is for a future salvation that is what I'm looking forward to as I hold my faith in Jesus Christ and in His blood, in His passion, death and resurrection as I endeavour to obey Him and keep His commandments, trying to maintain a good conscience, having been obedient to the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ.

I mentioned at my Tues Bible study on 19 Aug that I feel spiritually unwell.
I feel increasingly spiritually unwell.

I'm not bitter holding grudges with anyone.

I just:
- feel spiritually unwell.
- don't feel spiritually clean.
- want to hear the voice of Holy Spirit.
- don't understand why this has happened to me.

I have been getting attacked spiritually non-stop.

Indeed I was set free from sin on 2 April 2022 because I was baptised into Christ's death. I am extremely confident that that is what it is.

It only makes sense to view what happened to me as a second birth.

The flesh, the old self, was crucified.
The body of sin will be brought to nothing.

I was regenerated.
I was made a new creation.
Now the body of sin must be brought to nothing, so there is a battle.

Yet I believe that sanctification is ongoing in some sense. The entire time I've been holding my faith in Jesus. Yet whatever happened in an attempt to corrupt me after getting born-again happened to me regardless of the fact that I was keeping my faith, and also trying to hold a good conscience with God. God gave me the fear of Him and a new spirit and then I had to become obedient to the standard of teaching which I'm called to become obedient to.

Being dead to sin seems to not mean "unable to let indwelling sin reign in our mortal body", so it seems that being dead to sin and having been set free (and sin no longer having power over oneself), it's still possible for a person to then "let sin reign in the mortal body" (allow it to reign), and we definitely do not want to allow sin to reign in our mortal body. I think what Paul is saying here is that we have been set free from sin and that to let sin reign after you've been set free would be something like a king allowing his enemy to reign in his own kingdom. Rather than doing that, we should be walking in faith and obedience to Jesus Christ:

Sadly, though, it really feels as though I have come under attack by something which has been invading my dreams, giving me antichristian dreams and visions and dreams and visions which are not trustworthy (don't come with a confession that "Jesus Christ has not come [into the world, from God] in the flesh"), tempting to sin, arousing my body, tempting me into defiling "passion". Whatever has come against me is unacceptable and I think it's not fair. All the while, no word from Holy Spirit testifying to Jesus Christ. No word at all. My present situation really does not feel good.

God keeps allowing me to get harassed by demons, and I'm complaining about it because I can't live being terrorised by this and feeling like God is gaslighting me.
It's not nice being in a position where it feels as though God is ignoring you, but rather allowing demons to terrorise you. It really isn't.

I want to help people find Jesus but if God keeps letting me get harassed by demons, and if God doesn't heal me, and clean me (and I do have faith in Jesus' blood), and I do *want* to be healed (!!!) then how am I supposed to be effective at helping others to find Jesus? And wouldn't it just provide an awful testimony for others who witness what's going on?

We must *want* (agape love, treasure the light) to be healed / sanctified / made holy, to have purified consciences ([[https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hebrews%209%3A13-15&version=ESV][Hebrews 9:13-15]]) to serve God:

Yes, I want to be healed. Heal me, please, God, and please faithfully grant me the testimony of Jesus Christ through Your Holy Spirit, the testimony which says that Jesus Christ has come into the world in the flesh.

The situation I find myself in is incredibly unjust.
The very least that God can and should do in my honest opinion is speak to me clearly and give me the promised testimony of Jesus Christ from Holy Spirit.
I do not think it's good in any way to continue allowing me to be harassed by demons, especially while withholding the testimony.
It's been a very long time under these conditions, and a massive spiritual battle, and quite frankly I'm very sick of it.
There's nothing righteous about God holding me in this situation like this for such a long time when I have given Him everything.
God has to fulfill His promises, and this situation He has put me in is hell.
It's just not right to continue withholding the testimony.
I refuse to be forced to remain in this corrupt world, especially while under such heavy demonic oppression, especially while God is withholding the testimony of Jesus from His Holy Spirit.
I expect so much more from God.
It feels to me like the relationship I have with God is an abusive relationship.

** Journal <2025-09-01 Mon>
There is some evil spirit that has a record of attacking me daily, especially in the mornings and today was no exception. I have to try to avoid thinking about my present situation. And God didn't speak to me, but I received more demonic dreams, sleep interruption and this defilement attacking my soul today.

I am very much against the evil spirits which have been attacking me, and I'm pro-Jesus, pro-holiness, pro-God, pro-repentance. But I'm extremely disappointed at God for allowing me to be attacked by demons, and I do not understand at all why He can allow such things but withhold speaking to me Himself, withholding the testimony of Jesus Christ from Holy Spirit.

Specifically, one dream I had was of one of the YA leaders, a guy at a church I formerly attended having "transitioned" and had woman's breasts.
So I've been under attack by an LGBT demon. That is one thing which has been attacking me. And I rebuke that evil spirit in Jesus Christ's name.
In my soul, especially when I lie down or sit down, and especially at night, I feel a some spiritual defilement which manifests physically.
And it doesn't help me in any way that at the same time I'm experiencing isolation, slander, unjust prejudice in finding work, and demons preventing me from marriage, and also demons spreading heresy in the churches and also being in a world full of unlawful AI stuff with almost everyone embracing it, my old self crucified but forced to integrate into the world system or face the consequences, etc. I feel like my life is a living hell where there is nowhere to go and where Jesus Christ Himself seems to have abandoned me as well, Himself promising me He has not abandoned me and that His Holy Spirit will testify of Him, but seemingly not following through with that.

All that antichrist spirit which has been at work trying to destroy me, I rebuke in Jesus Christ's name. Hallelujah.

What is going on regarding the spiritual attack I'm receiving is not OK, and I repeat what I said yesterday, the relationship I have with God feels like an abusive relationship [where God considers me collateral/expendable] and just plain ignores me while I strive for faith and obedience and to please Him. I feel like my soul is very damaged now, and it currently feels irreparable because even though I have faith in Jesus, and I try to keep His commandments, and I want to be cleaned I feel like God has not cleaned me, but rather allows me to be harassed by demons, and this demonic harassment has felt like a very corrupting influence. There is something very not right about what has been going on.

But the worst part of it, is it feels like God doesn't want to even show Himself to be with me to comfort me through the testimony of Jesus Christ from Holy Spirit direct to my mind/heart/soul. I just don't understand that, and I'm going to record without deceit what is going on here. The Scripture says things which I'm learning about, and which I trust and I'm also recording my experiences.

+ Hmm... <2025-09-03 Wed> :: But God has led people to me that I can make testimony to. I trust in God that He knows what is going on. I believe that God is good and that all things will work together for good. I love God and I've just been afraid because the spiritual attack has been very intense. I believe God's still taking care of me and I will try to resist sin as I wait for Jesus.

Our Heavenly Father and our Lord Jesus Christ, and Holy Spirit,
Jehovah, Yahweh, Almighty God,
God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob.
Hallowed be Your name.
Your kingdom come, Your will be done on earth as it is done in heaven.
Give us today our daily bread and forgive us of our trespasses as we
forgive/have forgiven those who have trespassed against us.
And lead us not into temptation but deliver us from evil.
Please heal us, protect us and give us the promised testimony.
Please fix my life because it feels so damaged now,
and my conscience feels stuffed up and not repairable, and I blame it on
having been attacked by demons for an extremely long time without deliverance,
but while asking You for deliverance.
Please deliver me for Your name's sake, and heal me.
I don't want to be in this world any longer.
I want to be healed.
I want to be delivered.
I want You to speak to me.
Yours is the kingdom, the power and the glory forever and ever,
in Jesus Christ's name, I ask and pray.
AMEN!!

I'm very concerned about what is happening to me.
I feel spiritually sick.
I don't know what the tinglish on my tongue is.
I don't know why there is a burning warmth in my belly, a tightness in my chest, the movements, tingling and spontaneous arousal is.
I don't know why my dreams are invaded by demons daily.
I don't know I have been afflicted daily and nightly with terrible trials and demonic oppression/harassment.
But I want it to stop in the mighty name of Jesus Christ.
Please, LORD God, clean me with Your precious blood, I ask, AMEN!!

I want to be healed.

I want to be clean. God I was happy when I was born-again 3 years ago. I felt so spiritually clean and new, reborn, and alive from the dead.

    I actually think this view that a man does not have a right to take a wife is wrong. Believing men have a right to take a believing wife, just not whoever they want. It's a God-given right, though, for a believing man to take a believing wife!
    God has given human beings rights. One of these rights is to become a child of God through faith in Jesus (*[[https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%201%3A12-13&version=ESV][John 1:12-13]]*), for example. That means we have the right to keep Christ's commandments and noone has the right to deny a believer in Jesus the right to a) put a stop to sin, b) love your family in Christ (including forgiving them), and c) practice righteousness because that's how Apostle John describes children of God.
    We have a right to marry (*[[https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Corinthians%209%3A3-14&version=ESV][I Corinthians 9:3-14]]*) but not whoever we want, because a wife is a gift:
    People may not make use of their rights and decide to not marry for the sake of the Kingdom (*[[https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke%2018%3A29-30&version=ESV][Luke 18:29-30]]*, *[[https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2019%3A12&version=ESV][Matthew 19:12]]*).
    So it would be evil for the government to make it illegal for a man to take a wife (*[[https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Timothy%204%3A1-3&version=ESV][I Timothy 4:1-3]]*).
    In fact, making it impossible for a person to marry has the potential to be destructive to a person, if it pushes them into defiling passion then it can damage the person's soul (*[[https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Peter%202%3A11&version=ESV][I Peter 2:11]]*, *[[https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Colossians%202%3A20-23&version=ESV][Colossians 2:20-23]],3:1-6*).

If we want to start a family then we should have the fear of God and ask God. A wife is a gift from God:

I had an improved day today.

After going to sleep, I don't recall any times waking up during the night.
But I was awoken at a reasonable time this morning but under a bit of spiritual attack (feeling it in my body) and just after having a dream of me on the beach with the Beatles' singer John Lennon asking me if I wanted to join him for a beer and to listen to a mixtape of Paperback Writer, or something, and in the dream I said yes, and someone, him I think said, "Yay."

I woke up and I felt under spiritual attack.
I still rebuked this dream and rebuked the spiritual attack I was receiving.

Don't get me wrong, the Beatles were talented musicians and in the past I would overindulge in listening to them, but I'm in spiritual warfare and I'm trying to keep my focus on heavenly things rather than earthly things.

God have mercy.

And during the day I have received a fair amount of spiritual attack too.
It occurred to me during the day that John Lennon had that anti-religion song.

I'm not against Christian "religion", but see it still as a "guardian" or tutor, kinda like the old Law in that when a person is born-again and regenerate and radically transformed by the gospel, God's work pushes the envelope and religion can be a straitjacket. We need a personal relationship with Christ and for Holy Spirit to teach us and to be obedient and faithful to God, keeping His commandments not in pretense but in truth.

In the same way we also, when we were children, were enslaved to the elementary principles of the world. But when the fullness of time had come, God sent forth his Son, born of woman, born under the law, to redeem those who were under the law, so that we might receive adoption as sons. And because you are sons, God has sent the Spirit of his Son into our hearts, crying, Abba! Father! So you are no longer a slave, but a son, and if a son, then an heir through God. (ESV)

But overall I think it has been an improvement today where I was feeling stronger and ruling over sin.
I still have to be discerning and go by the Scripture.

During the day I went to the University and thought about now being light in the Lord Jesus, it being "day", God being our day, and I should be working the works of Him who sent Jesus Christ while it is day, and before I was born-again, it was "night".
I think that I should do a Bible study on that and find passages about it.

My citizenship is in heaven.

Just as I was lying down with my eyes closed, a picture appeared in my mind of a New Zealand passport (with a Maori graphic its the cover) lodged in the branches of a tree the forest just down the road from the house where I live.

And I thought to myself... I remember a few years ago before I was born-again when I was camping in the woods down the road with an Alice in Wonderland book... And around about that time I had been thinking about what Jack had said about maybe NZ being Eden (that is, God's garden).

I don't really believe that NZ is literally the original Garden of Eden. But I believe God does take care of His world.

There has been an evil spirit which has been slandering me and I rebuke it in the mighty name of Jesus Christ.

+ <2025-09-06 Sat> Just clarifying :: What I'm talking about, though, is something that has been ongoing, and I noticed something new yesterday. It honestly feels like fighting a hydra - taking out one head and pops up, or a game of whackamole, or cat and mouse there is a spirit working through people, constantly trying to propagate lies. Sometimes it looks like a spirit of unforgiveness. Other times it looks like a schism spirit. Other times it's just clearly pitting obedience up against faith Other times it manifests as pressure to be saved by works. I know with are saved by faith in Jesus Christ, that is the love of the truth in the heart; faith, love, obedience and actually the doing of God's commandments in the heart. I know that sounds abstract because it is, but it's still real.

I'm so sick and tired of this life.
I hate being here so much.
I hate being harassed by demons.
I got harassed during my sleep again today.

I've done some praying.
I've done some despairing.

I've done some questioning.
Why has Jesus Christ withheld from me the testimony from Holy Spirit?
Why do other so-called Christians not even give it to me?

    Here's some Bible verses to think about.

    *[[https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalms%20115%3A3-8&version=ESV][Psalms 115:3-8]]* - Our God is in the heavens; he does all that he pleases. Their idols are silver and gold, the work of human hands. They have mouths, but do not speak; eyes, but do not see. They have ears, but do not hear; noses, but do not smell. They have hands, but do not feel; feet, but do not walk; and they do not make a sound in their throat. Those who make them become like them; so do all who trust in them. (ESV)

    *[[https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation%2013%3A15-18&version=ESV][Revelation of John 13:15-18]]* - And it was allowed to give breath to the image of the beast, so that the image of the beast might even speak and might cause those who would not worship the image of the beast to be slain. Also it causes all, both small and great, both rich and poor, both free and slave, to be marked on the right hand or the forehead, so that no one can buy or sell unless he has the mark, that is, the name of the beast or the number of its name. This calls for wisdom: let the one who has understanding calculate the number of the beast, for it is the number of a man, and his number is 666. (ESV)

    *[[https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation%2018%3A2&version=ESV][Revelation of John 18:2]]* - And he called out with a mighty voice, Fallen, fallen is Babylon the great! She has become a dwelling place for demons, a haunt for every unclean spirit, a haunt for every unclean bird, a haunt for every unclean and detestable beast. (ESV)

I just think we need to take Christ's teachings and commandments seriously and not fear the AI stuff, but rather have faith in, love and obey God, and fear God, abiding in Jesus' teachings and commandments. We should go all-in with Jesus.

And in Jesus Christ's name I rebuke the demonic harassment which has been causing me sleep disruption.
And in Jesus Christ's name I rebuke those spirits which have been preventing me from taking a wife and from getting work.

So I believe that Jesus, (Yeshua, Joshua) is one of God's names, Jesus being God the Son of God, and Father God having given Jesus His own name which belongs to Him (to Father God):

+ As it says on the [[https://www.gotquestions.org/meaning-name-Jesus.html][GotQuestions website]] :: The name Jesus, announced to Joseph and Mary through the angels (Matthew 1:21; Luke 1:31), means ‚ÄúYahweh saves‚Äù or ‚ÄúYahweh is salvation.‚Äù Transliterated from Hebrew and Aramaic, the name is Yeshua. This word is a combination of Ya, an abbreviation for Yahweh, the name of Israel‚Äôs God (Exodus 3:14); and the verb yasha, meaning ‚Äúrescue,‚Äù ‚Äúdeliver,‚Äù or ‚Äúsave.‚Äù

Jesus (Yeshua, Iƒìsous) and Jehovah (Yahweh) all refer to God's name (*[[https://biblehub.com/greek/3686.htm][onoma]]*).

Nothing has changed with regards to who is my Lord and Saviour and God and King.

Gay marriage and homosexual relationships are inherently sinful and agape-loving the sin more than (or rather than) agape-loving Jesus leads to death.

We have to come to the love the Truth. The truth is Father God, the truth is Jesus Christ.

Age-gap marriage and relationships between consenting adults are not inherently sinful, as far as I understand.

A wife is a gift from God, and we can't take whoever we want.
We can ask God for a wife.

And I rebuke that anti-marriage spirit in the Mighty name of Jesus Christ, Jehovah, Yahweh, God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob.

I rebuke them in the mighty name of Jesus Christ.

As I was about to walk through the door of the Salvation Army today, a guy I had seen on the street referred to me as Rob, the name of my dad of the flesh (that is, my earthly dad), which was odd.
I attended the Sunday service at the Salvation Army, there was a quiz on fathers in the Bible. 
For example, there were a couple of questions:
- Which of these 4 options was a son to David? And the answer was Solomon.
- Which of these 4 options was father to Jacob? And the answer was Isaac.

I quickly found out that it's actually Father's Day today when it was mentioned.
Then the sermon was on [[https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke%2015%3A11-32&version=ESV][Luke 15:11-32]].

So it's obvious that what has happened today is clearly "spiritual" / "prophetic" in nature.

Anyway, I realised that I had missed one thing I want to rebuke today.
I also rebuke the spirit of transhumanism in the mighty name of Jesus Christ.
In the Mighty name of Jesus Christ's name I rebuke the spirit of substituting a spouse with a robot (or AI).
In the Mighty name of Jesus Christ I rebuke the spirit of having a robot (or AI) for a spouse.

+ [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PDW0ka8_T0][youtube.com: ? What the Bible REALLY Says About Women as Church Leaders {@HeavenlyMindedHome}]] :: I commented: Thank you. I am in essentially full agreement with this, and thanks for this. I'm recently born again and God has been teaching me and testing me. I love how you talked about how woman have calling to teach the children. And I learned a lot from this video. However 1 tiny thing I'd like to say is that I believe that woman in the Lord may be considered to be "sons" of God. The Biblical basis for this is...
    Just because a woman person may have an identity in Christ as a son of God (as Paul says neither male nor female), this transcendent reality is not a reason to pervert the natural order of things regarding natural gender. Paul is certainly not endorsing LGBT, etc. or same-sex marriage, and certainly not endorsing that slaves should not submit to their earthly master (*[[https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Titus%202%3A9-10&version=ESV][Titus 2:9-10]]*):. Interestingly, I think Jesus is implying by saying that the sons of this age marry and 'are given' (women are given) in marriage, that a woman may be considered a "son of this age", and it really gets me thinking about what that word 'son' is being used to mean. It's not a natural gender thing:

    *[[https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke%2020%3A33-36&version=ESV][Luke 20:33-36]]* - In the resurrection, therefore, whose wife will the woman be? For the seven had her as wife. And Jesus said to them, The sons of this age marry and 'are given' (women are given) in marriage, but those who are considered worthy to attain to that age and to the resurrection from the dead *neither marry nor are given in marriage*, for they cannot die anymore, because they are equal to angels and are *sons of God, being sons of the resurrection*.

    It's not left or right, Republican,
    Democrat, trans, straight or whatever
    there. I mean, there's an effort to
    recast this as a different kind of
    contest between worldviews.

    It's no, the dividing line is do you think God exists
    or do you think you are God? And it's
    that simple. It has always been that
    simple. It will never change. And I
    think our souls are at stake. I really,
    really believe that. I think Jesus is
    the only answer.

Just with Tucker's last comments here, I really think it's more than just
believing that God exists, but also trusting Him and loving Him.
But I hope that is what Tucker was trying to articulate here.

Jesus is our life. God must be our first love:

God, I'm tired of being here in this world being forced into isolation,
and being forced to cross paths with people who profess satanic beliefs.

Throughout the night last night, I received huge amounts of spiritual attack, waking up to evil dreams pushed into my head, and then receiving spirit spouse stuff in the day arousing my body and tempting me.

Jesus Christ help me.

I've been forced into my present situation against my will and held here.

While God just refuses to even give the testimony of Jesus Christ from Holy Spirit.
It's truly bizarre that God has withheld that from me.

I want the confession which the Apostle John speaks of.

In all likelihood the eschatology of the tribulation and rapture happens at the end of the age. How many ages are there? I simply do not know. Just the next one? Perhaps. More? Perhaps.

Just because I consider that God may or may not have more ages left, that doesn't mean I want to be here as a part of it.
I don't. I just see this as a fork in the road.
This age is wrapping up from what I can tell.

I don't want to stay here. I wholeheartedly believe that God can take me out of this world if it's His will.
I'm begging God to just get me out of here.
The spiritual warfare has been so intense.
I don't have a desire to be here anymore.
Marriage as a possibilty was, in my view robbed from me, and no longer an option.

    Tom, I just want to be taken out of this world and go to be with the Lord Jesus
    Christ. May Jesus Christ please save me and deliver me from this evil
    generation and deliver me from this world. I want to be raptured. I don't want
    to stay here. I keep getting attacked by demons. I've given my all for Jesus.
    I'm so tired and want to go home. I feel like there is so much spiritual
    darkness trying to force me to remain in this world. I've been born-again of
    the spirit. I don't want to stay here in this world. I don't belong in this
    world. God is good all the time. But it feels like I'm constantly receiving the
    opposite of what I ask for in prayer. There's some adversarial thing just
    constantly opposing sanctification and faith and trying to keep me in the
    world. I believe that rapture is imminent but that we should be walking in
    faith, love and holiness, abiding in Jesus' commandments, walking in the light,
    remaining faithful to Jesus, to be ready for rapture. God have mercy and let me
    not stay here on the earth. I'm so sick of it. I actually refuse to remain
    here. Jesus said about the sons of this age that they marry and are given in
    marriage. But sons of the resurrection neither marry nor are given in marriage.
    I've been spiritually resurrected. These certainly seem like Luke 21 times. I
    believe that God can absolutely rapture me. I don't believe we know the day or
    the hour it will happen. But I believe that it could happen at any time. Jesus
    Christ get me out of here. There's so much deception. I refuse to stay here.
    The church I just went to today was preaching against rapture. What I'm
    personally experiencing in my day to day is just so adversarial. There's so
    much deception in all the churches I've attended recently. I believe I'm a son
    of the resurrection. I'm not a son of this age, and it's an evil generation in
    my view.

    Oh yeah and I believe that Jesus died on a tree and rose from the dead. His
    blood paid the price for me to be completely set free from sin. Jesus paid the
    price for me to be redeemed, spirit, and body. Jesus is Jehovah the Son of God.
    Jesus is Yahweh.  We are unworthy servants. I've only endeavoured to my duty. I
    love God. I love Jesus. I'm trusting in Jesus' Christ's blood to be set free.
    It's Jesus' blood alone that can deal with my sin problem. I love my family in
    Christ. I endeavour to love my neighbour as myself. God knows I try to please
    Him. The evil that has come against me has seemed very defiling. May God take
    pity on me and deliver me from this world. May God sanctify me completely. May
    God speak to me please to give me the testimony of Jesus Christ from Holy
    Spirit confessing that Jesus Christ has come into the world in the flesh,
    direct to me. Please pray for me. I've been under so much spiritual attack. I
    was born-again of the spirit on 2 April 2022. I've literally seen my
    regenerated spirit and I called out to Jesus to save me. I don't want to be
    here. I refuse to remain here.

I'm really concerned about my sanctification.

Jesus Christ, don't let me die.
Why in Jesus Christ's name, in Yahweh's name, in Jehovah's name, why has the testimony of Jesus Christ not been given to me from Holy Spirit?
Why, God?
I don't understand how a person can get corrupted while they are trusting in Jesus Christ.
It makes no sense to me.
I don't understand how giving up everything for Jesus could bring on such spiritual oppression.
I don't understand why God has allowed me to be oppressed by such evil stuff, terrorised by demons for such a long time.
All the while, not speaking to me clearly, and allowing demons to harass me.
Jesus Christ help me.
For Your name's sake God please deliver me from evil and clean me, and speak to me clearly.

I actually don't remember much of dreams last night, but this morning I got a dream which I believe was adversarial/satanic, and masquerading with the face of an old friend.
And as much as I love my old friend (of the flesh) it was literally anti-rapture, anti-"what I'm praying to God and hoping in God for".
I just believe that it's satanic.
What I experienced yesterday was far worse. Yesterday I had these sickening demonic dreams/visions.
As I sit here I feel this defilement attacking my mind and soul.

Whatever rapture looks like, it certainly involves faith in Jesus Christ, and trusting in God's word, rather than following the course of this world.

I just pray for my old friends, those who were my friends before God put a new spirit inside of me.

If someone is not born-again of the spirit then they cant see the kingdom.
They'll be thinking like the world, seeing things the way the world sees.

We should be walking in faith, love and holiness, seeking to please God, not buying what God has entrusted to us, but sowing in His Kingdom.
We should be seeking the knowledge of Jesus Christ, abiding in His commandments, and walking by the spirit.
We should "get on with it", and not be fearful.

  *[[https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2025%3A1-46&version=ESV][Matthew 25:1-46]]* - Then the kingdom of heaven will be like ten virgins who took their lamps and went to meet the bridegroom. Five of them were foolish, and five were wise. For when the foolish took their lamps, they took no oil with them, but the wise took flasks of oil with their lamps. As the bridegroom was delayed, they all became drowsy and slept. But at midnight there was a cry, Here is the bridegroom! Come out to meet him. Then all those virgins rose and trimmed their lamps. And the foolish said to the wise, Give us some of your oil, for our lamps are going out. But the wise answered, saying, Since there will not be enough for us and for you, go rather to the dealers and buy for yourselves. And while they were going to buy, the bridegroom came, and those who were ready went in with him to the marriage feast, and the door was shut. Afterward the other virgins came also, saying, Lord, lord, open to us. But he answered, Truly, I say to you, I do not know you. Watch therefore, for you know neither the day nor the hour. For it will be like a man going on a journey, who called his servants and entrusted to them his property. To one he gave five talents, to another two, to another one, to each according to his ability. Then he went away. He who had received the five talents went at once and traded with them, and he made five talents more. So also he who had the two talents made two talents more. But he who had received the one talent went and dug in the ground and hid his master's money. Now after a long time the master of those servants came and settled accounts with them. And he who had received the five talents came forward, bringing five talents more, saying, Master, you delivered to me five talents; here I have made five talents more. His master said to him, Well done, good and faithful servant. You have been faithful over a little; I will set you over much. Enter into the joy of your master. And he also who had the two talents came forward, saying, Master, you delivered to me two talents; here I have made two talents more. His master said to him, Well done, good and faithful servant. You have been faithful over a little; I will set you over much. Enter into the joy of your master. He also who had received the one talent came forward, saying, Master, I knew you to be a hard man, reaping where you did not sow, and gathering where you scattered no seed, so I was afraid, and I went and hid your talent in the ground. Here you have what is yours. But his master answered him, You wicked and slothful servant! You knew that I reap where I have not sowed and gather where I scattered no seed? Then you ought to have invested my money with the bankers, and at my coming I should have received what was my own with interest. So take the talent from him and give it to him who has the ten talents. For to everyone who has will more be given, and he will have an abundance. But from the one who has not, even what he has will be taken away. And cast the worthless servant into the outer darkness. In that place there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth. When the Son of Man comes in his glory, and all the angels with him, then he will sit on his glorious throne. Before him will be gathered all the nations, and he will separate people one from another as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats. And he will place the sheep on his right, but the goats on the left. Then the King will say to those on his right, Come, you who are blessed by my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world. For I was hungry and you gave me food, I was thirsty and you gave me drink, I was a stranger and you welcomed me, I was naked and you clothed me, I was sick and you visited me, I was in prison and you came to me. Then the righteous will answer him, saying, Lord, when did we see you hungry and feed you, or thirsty and give you drink? And when did we see you a stranger and welcome you, or naked and clothe you? And when did we see you sick or in prison and visit you? And the King will answer them, Truly, I say to you, as you did it to one of the least of these my brothers, you did it to me. Then he will say to those on his left, Depart from me, you cursed, into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels. For I was hungry and you gave me no food, I was thirsty and you gave me no drink, I was a stranger and you did not welcome me, naked and you did not clothe me, sick and in prison and you did not visit me. Then they also will answer, saying, Lord, when did we see you hungry or thirsty or a stranger or naked or sick or in prison, and did not minister to you? Then he will answer them, saying, Truly, I say to you, as you did not do it to one of the least of these, you did not do it to me. And these will go away into eternal punishment, but the righteous into eternal life. (ESV)

    just sitting in here
    and doing some thinking and guys, I got
    to tell you, the spiritual warfare has
    picked up like nobody's business. Um
    something is coming very soon.
    There's just no doubt about it.
    Something is coming very, very, very, very,
    very, very soon.
    I feel it so strongly.
    Now's the time to repent for sin.
    Now's the time to get your relationship
    in right standing with God.
    Now it's time
    to pay attention to what you're looking
    at, to what you're doing, who you're
    talking to,
    what you're spending your time on,
    where you go, what you do, everything.
    Sorry guys, I got quiet there for a
    moment.
    There's a shift.
    There's a shift that's taking place
    within the spiritual realm.
    We can't see it happening but it is
    happening.
    It manifests itself
    through certain ways in the physical.
    We can feel it.
    Sometimes
    we think about it not for just, you
    know, no reason whatsoever.
    But be because of the reason of
    things are happening.
    There's an endless war between good and
    evil, God and Satan himself.
    And they're trying to Satan
    and demons are looking for access.
    They're looking access for access
    in your life,
    in your family,
    right? In your household,
    in your thoughts,
    in your desires,
    in your affections.
    in your acquaintance
    or acquaintances
    who you spend time with.
    Here's a battle that's raging on
    and it's not going to end until we leave
    this earth.
    Prepare yourself for what's coming.
    Prepare yourself for he who comes in the
    name of the Lord.
    And for those that will call upon the
    name of the Lord, they shall be saved.
    Make straight a highway, a path for the Lord.
    For the Lord's judgment
    and the Lord's indignation is coming
    to the disobedient,
    to the children who have disgraced their
    father with their many sins
    and iniquities.
    All because
    they've wanted to live their way, have
    it their way, indulge their way, spend
    time their way on what's important to them.
    It's only been about themselves.
    It's not been about anybody else.
    And it's certainly not been about God.
    For those of you that are watching, if
    the Holy Spirit is convicting you, it's
    time.
    It's time.
    It's time to repent.
    It's time to lay it at the altar at the
    feet of Jesus.
    It's time to recognize his sacrifice and
    that it's more than enough to defeat our
    sin, to defeat our addictions, to defeat
    our evil nature.
    It's more than enough.
    He's more than enough.
    But we've got to believe that in our hearts
    with all our heart, soul, mind, and strength.
    We can't pave the way for the enemy anymore.
    He who is stolen, let him steal no more.
    We must go back into the enemy's camp
    and take back what he's stolen from us.
    For the angel of the Lord encamps around
    about those who fear him
    and he defends them. He protects them.  Folks,
    the only way we're going to win this battle
    that wages every single day up until the
    day that we go home,
    the only way that we'll win this battle truly
    is that we set not our feet toward evil things.
    that we are so careful in what we
    cultivate in our minds, that we are so careful
    about every singular detail
    in spending time with God, how we go about it,
    that we don't rush it,
    that we don't get impatient,
    that we don't grow weary and welloing
    that we trust him even when it seems
    like we can't because his way
    his ways are higher than our ways and
    his thoughts are higher than our
    thoughts.
    For there is no other name given under
    heaven in which we should be saved.
    Choose this day whom you will serve.
    You cannot serve two masters.
    You will either love one and despise the other
    or you will despise the the one and love
    the other.
    Are you building a kingdom in this world
    for yourself?
    Are you storing up for yourselves
    treasures in heaven in heavenly kingdom
    where God through Jesus has
    went to prepare a place for you specifically
    that where he is you may be also.
    If it were not so he wouldn't have told us.
    Meditate on the word today.
    spend time in prayer and supplication.
    And if the Holy Spirit leads you to
    fast, fast also.
    God bless.

** Journal <2025-09-19 Fri>
- I've been under huge amounts of spiritual attack.
- God is good all the time, I believe, while I also endure extreme demonic oppression.
- God hasn't yet given me the testimony of Jesus Christ direct from Holy Spirit to my heart confessing / agreeing that Jesus Christ has come into the world from God in the flesh. But I am still agreeing that Jesus Christ is Jehovah the Son of God who has come into the world in the flesh from God (the Word of God became flesh).
- I'm sorry for getting upset at God.
- I hate my life here in this world. I passionately hate it.
- I hate how it seems like I'm continually going through tribulation and satanic resistance to holiness.
- I am angry with God for not providing the testimony of Jesus Christ from Holy Spirit.
- I am angry with how I perceive that I've been treated by God when I remember particular sufferings I have endured particularly after getting born-again, but also before.
- I feel as though I can't endure the isolation, the demonic harassment, and the withholding of the testimony from God direct to my spirit.
- Sanctification (being cleaned up) *is* the salvation.
- Only Father God knows the day or the hour when the coming of the Lord is.

Waking up to demonic dreams is not something I enjoy.
I rebuke these LGBT dreams in Jesus Christ's name.

I'm literally depressed and isolated and getting slammed by these demonic dreams every night.
All the while, God just refuses to give the testimony.

See how it says that a person does not sin by taking a wife, even after they are called. But Paul says for those who marry after they are called there will be worldly troubles. And also, Paul points out that the present form of the world is passing away, so after we are called by God, we should really be anticipating the coming of the Lord Jesus Christ:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *[[https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Corinthians%207%3A24-31&version=ESV][I Corinthians 7:24-31]]* - So, brothers, in whatever condition each was called, there let him remain with God. Now concerning the betrothed, I have no command from the Lord, but I give my judgment as one who by the Lord's mercy is trustworthy. I think that in view of the present distress it is good for a person to remain as he is. Are you bound to a wife? Do not seek to be free. Are you free from a wife? Do not seek a wife. But if you do marry, you have not sinned, and if a betrothed woman marries, she has not sinned. Yet those who marry will have worldly troubles, and I would spare you that. This is what I mean, brothers: *the appointed time has grown very short*. From now on, let those who have wives live as though they had none, and those who mourn as though they were not mourning, and those who rejoice as though they were not rejoicing, and those who buy as though they had no goods, and those who deal with the world as though they had no dealings with it. For the present form of this world is passing away. (ESV)
#+END_QUOTE

Nevertheless, I'm still committed to "remaining as I am", anticipating the coming of the Lord Jesus Christ.

I don't want to live in this world anymore. I wish my memories were erased.

I woke up this morning to getting another LGBT dream and some other stuff which was not the confession of the testimony that Jesus Christ has come into the world in the flesh,
and I had more spiritual attack against my soul.

Tired, I made breakfast and played some Cute Defense. I was in a game of "Cute Defense" on StarCraft II and 2 people were spreading perverted, sexual and homosexual speech in the game chat so everyone can see it and I initiated a votekick.

I was told they don't support the votekick and I responded to them that Jesus doesn't support them.
And one of them laughed.

I said that I hate them speading their perversion inside the game chat.

One of them said we're all sinners. I said that he sounded like an unrepentent one.

One of them said "I believe in God."

He said that hate is a sin.

I quoted 2 verses:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *[[https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalms%20139%3A21&version=ESV][Psalms 139:21]]* - Do I not hate (H6962. quwt, loathe) those who hate you, O LORD? And do I not loathe those who rise up against you? (ESV)

#+END_QUOTE

I had specifically said, "The fear of God is the hatred of sin." I think that's a good paraphrase.

I said if you obey sin you'll die but if you obey God you'll live.

I actually hate when people spread filthy, sexual words in the game.
And young people including children might be playing this video game.
And these people were defending what they were doing.

And I pray for them that they'll repent and come to love God and hate sin.

  Dear Heavenly Father and my Lord Jesus Christ and Holy Spirit,
  God, I want them to turn from their sin.
  please, God, my desire is for them to turn away from sin and for them to love, You, God.
  I hate with a righteous hatred when people commit gross injustice.
  Spreading disgusting perverted speech in a video game especially when there may be young people reading, I hate with a righteous hatred.
  And my anger against people who do such things is a righteous anger.
  I don't consider them to be my family in Christ if they are unrepentant.
  I know that I must agape love my family in Christ, but if people love sin more that You, God, then I just hate that,
  and I hate the fact that their actions influence other people and because I don't want people to perish, I want
  these people who love sin more than You to be stopped particularly because it hurts other people, and spreads corrupt behaviour.
  That's the issue. It's not that I don't want them to be saved. I want them to be saved.
  But I hate what they're doing. Do I love them? In that I don't want them to perish, yes, but come to a love of and knowledge of the truth.
  Please help them, God, to be saved.
  In Jesus Christ's name, I ask,

Your boasting is not good. Do you not know that a little leaven leavens the whole lump? Cleanse out the old leaven that you may be a new lump, as you really are unleavened. For Christ, our Passover lamb, has been sacrificed. Let us therefore celebrate the festival, not with the old leaven, the leaven of malice and evil, but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth.

But when the Helper comes, whom I will send to you from the Father, the Spirit of truth, who proceeds from the Father, he will bear witness about me. And you also will bear witness, because you have been with me from the beginning. *I have said all these things to you to keep you from falling away.* (ESV)

**** So that you will love one another

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *John 15:12-17* - This is my commandment, that you love one another as I have loved you. Greater love has no one than this, that someone lays down his life for his friends. You are my friends if you do what I command you. No longer do I call you servants, for the servant does not know what his master is doing; but I have called you friends, for all that I have heard from my Father I have made known to you. You did not choose me, but I chose you and appointed you that you should go and bear fruit and that your fruit should abide, so that whatever you ask the Father in my name, he may give it to you. *These things I command you, so that you will love one another.* (ESV)

*** I found out today about what Donald Trump recently said
Regarding what Donald Trump said at the Memorial for Charlie Kirk:

Donald said, "In that private moment on his dying day, we find everything we need to know about who Charlie Kirk truly was. He was a missionary with a noble spirit and a greatw great purpose. He did not hate his opponents. He wanted the best for them. That's where I disagreed with Charlie. I hate my opponent. And I don't want the best for them. I'm sorry. I am sorry, Erika. But now Erika can talk to me and the whole group and maybe they can convince me that that's not right. But I can't stand my opponent."

It's OK that he said he "can't stand my opponent" if it were meant in the sense of he's disgusted by his opponent.

But to say "I hate my opponent", I hope was only in that "loathing/disgusted by" sense and not in the "have no regard for the life of/does not see value in" sense, as agape love (which Christians are commanded to have for those who hate them) is a love which wishes for the other person to not perish.

It's disappointing that it was said with ambiguity, though, on TV.

In [[https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalms%20139%3A21&version=ESV][Psalms 139:21]], there are two words which are translated into the English word "hate" but they are different words with different meanings. [[https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Proverbs%208%3A13&version=ESV][Proverbs 8:13]] shows that it's a good thing to hate evil. As [[https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalms%20139%3A21&version=ESV][Psalms 139:21]] shows, David loathed people who hate God but in the Greek it doesn't say that he hated them the same way that those people hated God because a different word was used. Sadly, the English translation here confuses this by using the same word in place of two different words.
