My earliest memories are of living in Miramar before Weta Workshop.
Today at C3 Church, the pastor took an analogy from Lord of the Rings to describe sin.
What Frodo may have experienced in fiction, carrying the one ring, reminds me of my experience over the last 2 years.
In the books, the ring amplifies evil. The ring turned Sm√©agol into Gollum.
That's like what sin does to people - it corrupts people and the effects are:
- they are corrupted from the image of God.
- blindness to their condition, death.

People are born with corruption, but as people turn away from the truth and commit sin the corruption magnifies. It doesn't get better.

Corruption gets increasingly worse without atonement by blood.

  *[[https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hebrews%209%3A22&version=ESV][Hebrews 9:22]]* - Indeed, under the law almost everything is purified with blood, and *without the shedding of blood there is no forgiveness of sins*. (ESV)

Jesus said in [[https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2023%3A26&version=ESV][Matthew 23:26]] (from the ESV), "You blind Pharisee! First clean the inside of the cup and the plate, that the outside also may be clean."
We really don't want corruption in our heart or impurity in our spirit. The outside reflects what's going on inside us, and I don't mean merely our outward appearance. Dare I confess this but I will for the sake of others so they may take sin seriously, after being born-again as I had been repenting (even after being born-again), I have seen things that have made me feel like in some sense my spiritual innocence has been stolen.

While sin corrupts, the grace of God through blood of Jesus can restore us. He is the perfect man, and His blood washes us clean from corruption.

  *[[https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Corinthians%204%3A4&version=ESV][II Corinthians 4:4]]* - In their case the god of this world has blinded the minds of the unbelievers, to keep them from seeing the light of the gospel of the glory of Christ, who is the image of God. (ESV)

I just didn't expect that after I was born-again that there was going to be a spiritual battle. But there is a battle, and it hit me fast and hard.

  *[[https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%208%3A13&version=ESV][Romans 8:13]]* - For if you live according to the flesh you will die, but if by the Spirit you put to death the deeds of the body, you will live. (ESV)

Like traumatised Frodo where Hobbiton was essentially ruined for him, I have among other things asked to be born-again again, and that I can be [[https://meninblack.fandom.com/wiki/Neuralyzer][neuralyzed]] because of what I've been through, or raptured and taken to heaven, everything new. But I'm still here, it seems. At least I've been brought into Christ.
