Actually, more specifically, Jesus is talking about when people keep Jesus' commandments and sayings and do them, they are like a man building their house on the rock. I feel like Catholic Truth here is taking a saying of Jesus out of its own context to use it in another context. But in its own context, this verse is talking about people who hear and do Jesus' sayings:

Belief is important (and is an initial act of obedience):

  *[[https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2016%3A15-18&version=ESV][Matthew 16:15-18]]* - He said to them, But who do you say that I am? Simon Peter replied, *You are the Christ, the Son of the living God*. And Jesus answered him, Blessed are you, Simon Bar-Jonah! For _flesh and blood has not revealed this to you, but my Father who is in heaven_. And I tell you, you are Peter, and *on this rock I will build my church*, and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it. (ESV)

Obedience is important:

  *[[https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke%206%3A46-49&version=ESV][Luke 6:46-49]]* - Why do you call me Lord, Lord, and not do what I tell you? _Everyone who comes to me and hears my words and does them, I will show you *what he is like: he is like* a man building a house, who dug deep and laid the foundation on the rock_. And when a flood arose, the stream broke against that house and could not shake it, because it had been well built. But the one who hears and does not do them is like a man who built a house on the ground without a foundation. When the stream broke against it, immediately it fell, and the ruin of that house was great. (ESV)

Jesus prepares a place for us. He builds us a heavenly dwelling. As we keep Jesus' sayings, the Lord is building for us a house in the heavens.

As we believe and obey Jesus Christ our house is built.
- *[[https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Philippians%202%3A13&version=ESV][Philippians 2:13]]* - for it is God who works in you, both to will and to work for his good pleasure. (ESV)
- *[[https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalms%20127%3A1&version=ESV][Psalms 127:1]]* - Unless the LORD ([[https://biblehub.com/hebrew/3068.htm][3068. Yhvh]] - /Phonetic Spelling: (yeh-ho-vaw'), Meaning: Jehovah/) builds the house, those who build it labor in vain. Unless the LORD watches over the city, the watchman stays awake in vain. (ESV)
  - If Jehovah builds the house then those who build it *do not labour in vain*
- *[[https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke%206%3A48&version=ESV][Luke 6:48]]* - he is like a man building a house, who dug deep and laid the foundation on the rock. And when a flood arose, the stream broke against that house and could not shake it, because it had been well built. (ESV)
- *[[https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Timothy%202%3A24-26&version=ESV][II Timothy 2:24-26]]* - And the Lord's servant must not be quarrelsome but kind to everyone, able to teach, patiently enduring evil, correcting his opponents with gentleness. God may perhaps grant them repentance leading to a knowledge of the truth, and they may escape from the snare of the devil, after being captured by him *to do his will*. (ESV)
- *[[https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Corinthians%205%3A1-3&version=ESV][II Corinthians 5:1-3]]* - For we know that if the tent, which is our earthly home, is destroyed, we have a building from God, a house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens. For in this tent we groan, longing to put on our heavenly dwelling, if indeed by putting it on we may not be found naked. (ESV)
- *[[https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hebrews%203%3A4&version=ESV][Hebrews 3:4]]* - (For every house is built by someone, but the builder of all things is God.) (ESV)
