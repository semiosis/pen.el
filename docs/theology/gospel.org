* Gospel
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *John 3:16-21* - For God so loved the world, that he gave his only Son, that whoever (G3956 pas) believes (G4100 pisteuo) in him should not perish but have eternal life. For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but in order that the world might be saved through him. Whoever believes in him is not condemned, but whoever does not believe is condemned already, because he has not believed in the name of the only Son of God. And this is the judgment: the light has come into the world, and people loved the darkness rather than the light because their deeds were evil. For everyone who does wicked things hates the light and does not come to the light, lest his deeds should be exposed. But _whoever does what is true comes to the light_, so that _it may be clearly seen that his deeds have been carried out in God_. (ESV)
#+END_QUOTE

The gospel involves deeds being carried out in God.

Whoever _does what is true comes to the light._

_Whoever has faith in and puts their trust in in Jesus Christ is not condemned and should not perish._

We must honour Jesus Christ:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *John 5:21-24* - For as the Father raises the dead and gives them life, so also the Son gives life to whom he will. The Father judges no one, but has given all judgment to the Son, that all may honor the Son, just as they honor the Father. _Whoever does not honor the Son does not honor the Father who sent him_. Truly, truly, I say to you, whoever _hears my word and believes (G4100 *pisteuo*) him who sent me has eternal life_. He does not come into judgment, but has passed from death to life.
#+END_QUOTE

I believe =John 5:24= is a true statement and that it should not be read outside of the words Jesus said directly before it (=Whoever does not honor the Son does not honor the Father who sent him=).

We do not nullify the rest of what Jesus has commanded of and asked of us. If Jesus is your judge, then I think it's wise to take on board the rest of what Jesus has said:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *Philippians 1:15-22* - Some indeed preach Christ from envy and rivalry, but others from good will. The latter do it out of love, knowing that I am put here for the defense of the gospel. The former proclaim Christ out of rivalry, not sincerely but thinking to afflict me in my imprisonment. What then? Only that in every way, whether in pretense or in truth, Christ is proclaimed, and in that I rejoice. Yes, and I will rejoice, for I know that through your prayers and the help of the Spirit of Jesus Christ this will turn out for my deliverance, as _it is my eager expectation and hope that I will not be at all ashamed, but that with full courage now as always Christ will be honored in my body, whether by life or by death_. For to me to live is Christ, and to die is gain. _If I am to live in the flesh, that means fruitful labor for me._ Yet which I shall choose I cannot tell.
#+END_QUOTE

We're not justified through the works of the law but through faith, and faith involves obedience to Jesus Christ:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *Galatians 2:15-16* - “We are Jews by nature and not sinners from among the Gentiles; nevertheless knowing that a man is not justified by the works of the Law but through faith in Christ Jesus, even we have believed in Christ Jesus, so that we may be *justified by faith in Christ* and not by the works of the Law; since by the works of the Law no flesh will be justified.
#+END_QUOTE

It's by faith in Christ that we are justified, and faith involves obedience.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *John 3:36* - Whoever believes (G4100 pisteuo) in the Son has eternal life; whoever does not *obey* the Son shall not see life, but the wrath of God remains on him. (ESV)

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *John 3:16* - "For God (G2316 theos) so (G3779 houto) loved (G25 agapao) the world (G2889 kosmos), that He gave (G1325 didomi) His only (G3439 monogenes) begotten (G3439 monogenes) Son (G5207 huios), that whoever (G3956 pas) believes (G4100 pisteuo) in Him shall not perish (G622 apollumi), but have (G2192 echo) eternal (G166 aionios) life (G2222 zoe).

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *1 John 3:23* - And this is his commandment, that we believe in the name of his Son Jesus Christ and love one another, just as he has commanded us. (ESV)
#+END_QUOTE

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *Matthew 22:37-39* - And he said to him, You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind. This is the great and first commandment. And a second is like it: You shall love your neighbor as yourself. (ESV)
#+END_QUOTE

Jesus Christ is the Son of the Living God. Believing on His name is God's will for us, and loving one another is God's will for us as He has commanded. There is more that Jesus has commanded us, too.

The promise to Gentiles:

Galatians 3:8* - And the Scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the Gentiles by faith, preached the gospel beforehand to Abraham, saying, In you shall all the nations be blessed. (ESV)

Genesis 12:3* - I will bless those who bless you, and him who dishonors you I will curse, and in you all the families of the earth shall be blessed. (ESV)

Because Abraham _obeyed God's voice_:

Genesis 22:18* - and in your offspring shall all the nations of the earth be blessed, because you have obeyed my voice. (ESV)

Repentance and coming to the light are absolutely part of the gospel!

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *1 Corinthians 15:1-4* -  Now I would remind you, brothers, of the gospel I preached to you, which you received, in which you stand, and by which you are being saved, if you hold fast to the word I preached to you-unless you believed in vain.  For I delivered to you as of first importance what I also received: that Christ died for our sins in accordance with the Scriptures, that he was buried, that he was raised on the third day in accordance with the Scriptures,  (ESV)
#+END_QUOTE

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *Acts 2:47* - Praising God, and having favour with all the people. And the Lord added to the church daily such as should be saved. (ESV)
#+END_QUOTE

** A life of faith (living in accordance with the truth, and in relationship with God) is required - faith continues
What I mean by relationship is:
- being obedient to God,
  - abiding in Jesus
- being accountable to God,
- waiting on God,
- trusting on God,
- being led by the Spirit of God,
- etc.

*** We must abide by his teaching

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *II John 1:9* - Everyone who goes on ahead and does not abide in the teaching of Christ, does not have God. Whoever abides in the teaching has both the Father and the Son.
#+END_QUOTE

It is a gift to be obedient to Jesus:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *Romans 6:23* - For the wages of sin is death, but the free gift of God is eternal life _in_ Christ Jesus our Lord. (ESV)
#+END_QUOTE

*** We must live sowing to the Spirit

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *Galatians 6:7-8* - Do not be deceived: God is not mocked, for whatever one sows, that will he also reap. For the one who sows to his own flesh will from the flesh reap corruption, but the one who sows to the Spirit will from the Spirit reap eternal life. (ESV)
#+END_QUOTE

#+END_QUOTE

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *Colossians 2:18-19* - Let no one disqualify you, insisting on asceticism and worship of angels, going on in detail about visions, puffed up without reason by his sensuous mind, and not holding fast to the Head, from whom the whole body, nourished and knit together through its joints and ligaments, grows with a growth that is from God.
#+END_QUOTE

*** We should clean ourselves with the aid of the Word and the Holy Spirit
We should clean ourselves up:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *II Timothy 2:21* - Therefore, if anyone cleanses himself from what is dishonorable, he will be a vessel for honorable use, set apart as holy, useful to the master of the house, ready for every good work.
#+END_QUOTE

Through faith, the Holy Spirit cleanses us:

  *Acts 15:8-9* - And God, who knows the heart, bore witness to them, by giving them the Holy Spirit just as he did to us, and he made no distinction between us and them, having cleansed their hearts by faith.

By obedience to the word of God:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *Ephesians 5:25-27* - Husbands, love your wives, as Christ loved the church and gave himself up for her, that he might sanctify her, having cleansed her by the washing of water with the word, so that he might present the church to himself in splendor, without spot or wrinkle or any such thing, that she might be holy and without blemish.
#+END_QUOTE

By the Holy Spirit washing and renewing us:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *Titus 3:4-6*- But when the goodness and loving kindness of God our Savior appeared, he saved us, not because of works done by us in righteousness, but according to his own mercy, by the washing of regeneration and renewal of the Holy Spirit, whom he poured out on us richly through Jesus Christ our Savior,
#+END_QUOTE

It's the will of God:

#+END_QUOTE

*** We *must* clean ourselves up
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *Daniel 12:9-10* - He said, Go your way, Daniel, for the words are shut up and sealed until the time of the end.

#+END_QUOTE

#+BEGIN_QUOTE

#+END_QUOTE

*** We must stop sinning

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *II Peter 2:2-4* - And many will follow their sensuality, and because of them _the way of truth_ will be blasphemed. And in their greed they will exploit you with false words. Their condemnation from long ago is not idle, and their destruction is not asleep. For if God did not spare angels when they sinned, but cast them into hell and committed them to chains of gloomy darkness to be kept until the judgment;
#+END_QUOTE

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *II Peter 2:19-20* - They promise them freedom, but they themselves are slaves of corruption. For _whatever overcomes a person, to that he is enslaved_. For if, after they have escaped the defilements of the world through the knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, they are again entangled in them and overcome, the last state has become worse for them than the first.
#+END_QUOTE

Therefore, the way of truth involves following Jesus and putting a stop to sin.

I agree with Billy Graham:

#+END_QUOTE

** The sons of disobedience are the ones who are conformed to sexual immorality, impurity, or covetousness, etc.
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *Ephesians 5:5-7* - For you may be sure of this, that everyone who is sexually immoral or impure, or who is covetous (that is, an idolater), has no inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and God. Let no one deceive you with empty words, for because of these things the wrath of God comes upon the sons of disobedience. Therefore do not associate with them;

** Get to know Jesus by following His commandments
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *Matthew 7:21-27* - Not everyone who says to me, Lord, Lord, will enter the kingdom of heaven, but the one who does the will of my Father who is in heaven.  On that day many will say to me, Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in your name, and cast out demons in your name, and do many mighty works in your name?  And then will I declare to them, I never knew you; depart from me, you workers of lawlessness.  Everyone then who hears these words of mine and does them will be like a wise man who built his house on the rock.  And the rain fell, and the floods came, and the winds blew and beat on that house, but it did not fall, because it had been founded on the rock.  And everyone who hears these words of mine and does not do them will be like a foolish man who built his house on the sand.  And the rain fell, and the floods came, and the winds blew and beat against that house, and it fell, and great was the fall of it. (ESV)

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *Luke 6:46-49* - Why do you call me Lord, Lord, and not do what I tell you? Everyone who comes to me and hears my words and does them, I will show you what he is like: he is like a man building a house, who dug deep and laid the foundation on the rock. And when a flood arose, the stream broke against that house and could not shake it, because it had been well built. But the one who hears and does not do them is like a man who built a house on the ground without a foundation. When the stream broke against it, immediately it fell, and the ruin of that house was great. (ESV)

We must obey God. We have faith in God who was delivered up for our trespasses and raised for our justification, and having faith in God is having faith in His Son which is believing in and obeying Jesus Christ:
