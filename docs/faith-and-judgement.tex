\section{My thoughts and bible references regarding theology}
\label{sec:orgf3726db}
\textbf{Acts 13:48} - And when the Gentiles heard this, they began rejoicing and glorifying the word of the Lord, and as many as were appointed to eternal life believed. (ESV)

I've been thinking about belief, faith, works, law and receiving the Holy Spirit!
Please let me know what you think if you have the time.
I'm trying to get clearer on this.

\subsection{The law}
\label{sec:orgd30db03}

\textbf{Matthew 19:4-9} - He answered, Have you not read that he who created them from the beginning made them male and female, and said, Therefore a man shall leave his father and his mother and hold fast to his wife, and they shall become one flesh? So they are no longer two but one flesh. What therefore God has joined together, let not man separate. They said to him, Why then did Moses command one to give a certificate of divorce and to send her away? He said to them, Because of your hardness of heart Moses allowed you to divorce your wives, but from the beginning it was not so. And I say to you: whoever divorces his wife, except for sexual immorality, and marries another, commits adultery. (ESV)

\textbf{Matthew 5:14-20} - You are the light of the world. A city set on a hill cannot be hidden. Nor do people light a lamp and put it under a basket, but on a stand, and it gives light to all in the house. In the same way, let your light shine before others, so that they may see your good works and give glory to your Father who is in heaven. Do not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them. For truly, I say to you, until heaven and earth pass away, not an iota, not a dot, will pass from the Law until all is accomplished. Therefore whoever relaxes one of the least of these commandments and teaches others to do the same will be called least in the kingdom of heaven, but whoever does them and teaches them will be called great in the kingdom of heaven. For I tell you, unless your righteousness exceeds that of the scribes and Pharisees, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven. (ESV)

\textbf{Leviticus 18:22} - You shall not lie with a male as with a woman; it is an abomination. (ESV)

\textbf{Romans 7:22} - For I delight in the law of God, in my inner being, (ESV)

\subsubsection{The law may be pursued by faith. Justification through faith}
\label{sec:org048b751}

\begin{verbatim}
1           Faith
2         /       \
3    Those who     Gentiles
4  pursue the law
5    by faith
\end{verbatim}

\textbf{Romans 9:31-32} - but that Israel who pursued a law that would lead to righteousness did not succeed in reaching that law. Why? Because they did not pursue it by faith, but as if it were based on works. They have stumbled over the stumbling stone, (ESV)

The most important thing though is faith because it applies to both the adherent of the law and also the Gentile who has faith.

\textbf{Romans 4:16} - That is why it depends on faith, in order that the promise may rest on grace and be guaranteed to all his offspring—not only to the adherent of the law but also to the one who shares the faith of Abraham, who is the father of us all, (ESV)

\textbf{Matthew 21:32} - For John came to you in the way of righteousness, and you did not believe him, but the tax collectors and the prostitutes believed him. And even when you saw it, you did not afterward change your minds and believe him. (ESV)

To follow the law by faith, I think, is to not lie, commit adultery, idolize, etc. in truth and reality, keeping yourself accountable to God.

\subsection{The law is good, if used properly - and its usage is part of the gospel}
\label{sec:org26eb238}
\textbf{1 Timothy 1:8-11} -  Now we know that the law is good, if one uses it lawfully, understanding this, that the law is not laid down for the just but for the lawless and disobedient, for the ungodly and sinners, for the unholy and profane, for those who strike their fathers and mothers, for murderers, the sexually immoral, men who practice homosexuality, enslavers, liars, perjurers, and whatever else is contrary to sound doctrine, in accordance with the glorious gospel of the blessed God with which I have been entrusted.  (ESV)

\subsection{Anyone who believes in Him receives forgiveness of sins}
\label{sec:org8fc9743}
\textbf{Acts 10:43:} Of Him all the prophets bear witness that through His name everyone who believes in Him receives forgiveness of sins.”

\subsection{Faith has a quantity, and faith receives from God}
\label{sec:org64431aa}
\textbf{Luke 7:8-9} -  For I too am a man set under authority, with soldiers under me: and I say to one, Go, and he goes; and to another, Come, and he comes; and to my servant, Do this, and he does it.  When Jesus heard these things, he marveled at him, and turning to the crowd that followed him, said, I tell you, not even in Israel have I found such faith.  (ESV)

\subsubsection{Faith has substance, and a quantity, usually drawn out over time}
\label{sec:org38b6155}
\textbf{Hebrews 11:1} -  Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen.  (KJV)

\textbf{Hebrews 11:1} - Now faith is the assurance of things hoped for, the conviction of things not seen. (ESV)

\textbf{Matthew 17:20} - He said to them, Because of your little faith. For truly, I say to you, if you have faith like a grain of mustard seed, you will say to this mountain, Move from here to there, and it will move, and nothing will be impossible for you. (ESV)

I think faith is like casting a net to receive something.

If you want to catch something big then you need a lot of faith.

Faith receives salvation, and salvation is the gift which is received through faith.
Faith is something which a person must have to receive the free gift.
The onus is on us to receive the free gift.

We must approach Jesus.
We must repent (change our minds, turning from our wicked ways, and turn to God) and obey God.
God has said many things, about his statutes and about how we should listen to Jesus.
I think repentance (from the heart turning from sin) is still approaching Jesus because Jesus fulfilled the law.

Humble yourself and obey God's commandments (not out of pride, but out of authentic faith with God, being accountable to God, in secret).
Trying to turn from sin in truth and reality.

\textbf{2 Chronicles 7:14} -  if my people who are called by my name humble themselves, and pray and seek my face and turn from their wicked ways, then I will hear from heaven and will forgive their sin and heal their land.  (ESV)

\textbf{Matthew 18:3} -  and said, Truly, I say to you, unless you turn and become like children, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven.  (ESV)

It says unless \textbf{you} turn - The onus is on you.

\textbf{Matthew 5:20} - For I tell you, unless your righteousness exceeds that of the scribes and Pharisees, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven. (ESV)

It says unless \textbf{your} righteousness.

\emph{\textbf{Through faith a person is saved (the onus is on us to receive)}}

Salvation is the gift.

\textbf{Ephesians 2:8} - For by grace you have been saved through faith.  And this is not your own doing; it is the gift of God,  (ESV)

\subsubsection{The work of faith}
\label{sec:org55b1715}
\textbf{Hebrews 11:8} - By faith Abraham obeyed when he was called to go out to a place that he was to receive as an inheritance. And he went out, not knowing where he was going. (ESV)

\textbf{Hebrews 11:6} - And without faith it is impossible to please him, for whoever would draw near to God must believe that he exists and that he rewards those who seek him. (ESV)

Work substantiates faith because it is the act of receiving from God.

A work of faith could indeed be following the law in faith (as opposed to following the law by works).

For example, keeping your integrity, remaining faithful to God and not lying to God.

\subsubsection{Faith receives}
\label{sec:org6b8fe4c}
\textbf{Hebrews 11:13} - These all died in faith, not having received the things promised, but having seen them and greeted them from afar, and having acknowledged that they were strangers and exiles on the earth.

\subsubsection{Her faith saved her / is forgiven because she loved much}
\label{sec:org2906117}
Her love is a work of faith.

\textbf{Luke 7:47-50} -  Therefore I tell you, her sins, which are many, are forgiven—for she loved much.  But he who is forgiven little, loves little.  And he said to her, Your sins are forgiven.  Then those who were at table with him began to say among themselves, Who is this, who even forgives sins?  And he said to the woman, Your faith has saved you; go in peace.  (ESV)

I also currently believe that one's response to forgiveness must be like the woman Jesus mentions in Luke 7:47 - with a PROPROTIONAL love for Jesus.

\section{Who will enter heaven?}
\label{sec:org0be03f6}
\textbf{1 Corinthians 6:9-20} -  Do you not know that the unrighteous will not inherit the kingdom of God?  Do not be deceived: neither the sexually immoral, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor men who practice homosexuality, nor thieves, nor the greedy, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor swindlers will inherit the kingdom of God.  And such were some of you.  But you were washed, you were sanctified, you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and by the Spirit of our God.  All things are lawful for me, but not all things are helpful.  All things are lawful for me, but I will not be enslaved by anything.  Food is meant for the stomach and the stomach for food—and God will destroy both one and the other.  The body is not meant for sexual immorality, but for the Lord, and the Lord for the body.  And God raised the Lord and will also raise us up by his power.  Do you not know that your bodies are members of Christ?  Shall I then take the members of Christ and make them members of a prostitute?  Never! Or do you not know that he who is joined to a prostitute becomes one body with her?  For, as it is written, The two will become one flesh.  But he who is joined to the Lord becomes one spirit with him.  Flee from sexual immorality.  Every other sin a person commits is outside the body, but the sexually immoral person sins against his own body.  Or do you not know that your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit within you, whom you have from God?  You are not your own, for you were bought with a price.  So glorify God in your body.  (ESV)

\subsection{Sinners will not inherit the kingdom of God}
\label{sec:org4af45f3}

\textbf{Galatians 5:19-21} -  Now the works of the flesh are evident: sexual immorality, impurity, sensuality, idolatry, sorcery, enmity, strife, jealousy, fits of anger, rivalries, dissensions, divisions, envy, drunkenness, orgies, and things like these.  I warn you, as I warned you before, that those who do such things will not inherit the kingdom of God.  (ESV)

\subsection{Following the law properly is not a matter of self-righteousness, it's a matter of who has stopped sinning}
\label{sec:org114a354}

\textbf{Revelation 22:15} -  Outside are the dogs and sorcerers and the sexually immoral and murderers and idolaters, and everyone who loves and practices falsehood.  (ESV)

\textbf{Ephesians 5:5} -  For you may be sure of this, that everyone who is sexually immoral or impure, or who is covetous (that is, an idolater), has no inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and God.  (ESV)

\textbf{1 John 3:4-9} -  Everyone who makes a practice of sinning also practices lawlessness; sin is lawlessness.  You know that he appeared to take away sins, and in him there is no sin.  No one who abides in him keeps on sinning; no one who keeps on sinning has either seen him or known him.  Little children, let no one deceive you.  Whoever practices righteousness is righteous, as he is righteous.  Whoever makes a practice of sinning is of the devil, for the devil has been sinning from the beginning.  The reason the Son of God appeared was to destroy the works of the devil.  No one born of God makes a practice of sinning, for God's seed abides in him, and he cannot keep on sinning because he has been born of God.  (ESV)

\subsection{This makes sense - the law certainly still exists}
\label{sec:orgebb33d3}
\textbf{1 Timothy 1:8-11} -  Now we know that the law is good, if one uses it lawfully, understanding this, that the law is not laid down for the just but for the lawless and disobedient, for the ungodly and sinners, for the unholy and profane, for those who strike their fathers and mothers, for murderers, the sexually immoral, men who practice homosexuality, enslavers, liars, perjurers, and whatever else is contrary to sound doctrine, in accordance with the glorious gospel of the blessed God with which I have been entrusted.  (ESV)

\subsection{Great or small in the kingdom of God}
\label{sec:orgaa0f7de}
Those who annul and teach others to break the law will be called least in the kingdom.
\begin{itemize}
\item It's prideful to say that God is wrong, Jesus behaved badly and that the Law is wrong
\begin{itemize}
\item It refuses to acknowledge sin
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
Those who keep God's commandments and AND the righteousness of faith / the testimony of Jesus will be called great in the kingdom.
\begin{itemize}
\item This is humility to keep God's commandments by faith (and not works)
\end{itemize}

There is a self-righteous way of trying to keep the law, and there is a humble way.
The self-righteous way is to pursue the law as if by works - telling God you're righteous because of technicality.
\begin{itemize}
\item The self-righteous way often makes the mistake of condemning the innocent.
\item The self-righteous way often makes the mistake of being without mercy, or love.
\end{itemize}
The humble, faith way is accountable to God - it's not lying to God.
\begin{itemize}
\item It's loving God, and loving one's neighbour.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Gay 'marriage'}
\label{sec:org28aec1c}
I currently believe this means that grace may exist for gay people who have faith in Jesus but they are accountable to God for it.
This is my current understanding. Is this correct?

Also, the Kingdom stretches from heaven to earth, so gay 'marriage' may happen on earth but such a thing could never exist in heaven.
But neither does marriage between man and woman even exist in heaven.

But those who practice sexual impurity which includes homosexuality wont inherit the kingdom. But can they enter the kingdom on earth?

\textbf{Matthew 6:10} - Your kingdom come, your will be done, on earth as it is in heaven.

The question is, which I do not have the answer for, is there any place for it in God's kingdom anywhere down? Maybe, maybe not.

God's original design is male and female union and also the law reflects the spiritual reality.

I saw a dark spot around my rib when I was born-again.
I think this indicates I am male, and there's a female kingdom partner out there for me!

\url{https://web.archive.org/web/20220402091720/https://mullikine.github.io/posts/astral-projection/}

I think it's really unlikely that it is tolerated anywhere in God's kingdom.

I don't think God ever endorses people to sin.

\subsection{Abiding in Christ}
\label{sec:org9788fd5}
\begin{itemize}
\item Maintaining belief in Jesus is the basic requirement which prevents you from being cut off
\begin{itemize}
\item But that is not enough to be counted a disciple of Jesus
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Securely abiding in Christ}
\label{sec:orgc342541}
\begin{itemize}
\item Loving Jesus and abiding in His love involves keeping His commandments
\begin{itemize}
\item Love one another as He loved us - the same way, selflessly, forgivingly, mercifully, compassionately
\item Love God faithfully
\begin{itemize}
\item An indicator is that the world hates you
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\item Keeping all of Jesus' words, keeping His commandments
\begin{itemize}
\item Ask whatever you wish
\end{itemize}
\item Bear fruit
\begin{itemize}
\item Forgiving others, loving others (charity, etc.)
\item Prove to be a disciple of Jesus
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{God the Father can graft people in and out of Christ}
\label{sec:orgf72bf6a}

So take repentance seriously, and keep Jesus' words and His commandments.
And, most importantly, believe in Jesus, and that he has paid the price for your sin with His blood.

\textbf{John 15} - I am the true vine, and my Father is the vinedresser.  Every branch of mine that does not bear fruit he takes away, and every branch that does bear fruit he prunes, that it may bear more fruit.  Already you are clean because of the word that I have spoken to you.  Abide in me, and I in you. As the branch cannot bear fruit by itself, unless it abides in the vine, neither can you, unless you abide in me.  I am the vine; you are the branches. Whoever abides in me and I in him, he it is that bears much fruit, for apart from me you can do nothing.  If anyone does not abide in me he is thrown away like a branch and withers; and the branches are gathered, thrown into the fire, and burned.  If you abide in me, and my words abide in you, ask whatever you wish, and it will be done for you.  By this my Father is glorified, that you bear much fruit and so prove to be my disciples.  As the Father has loved me, so have I loved you. Abide in my love.  If you keep my commandments, you will abide in my love, just as I have kept my Father's commandments and abide in his love.  These things I have spoken to you, that my joy may be in you, and that your joy may be full.  This is my commandment, that you love one another as I have loved you.  Greater love has no one than this, that someone lays down his life for his friends.  You are my friends if you do what I command you.  No longer do I call you servants, for the servant does not know what his master is doing; but I have called you friends, for all that I have heard from my Father I have made known to you.  You did not choose me, but I chose you and appointed you that you should go and bear fruit and that your fruit should abide, so that whatever you ask the Father in my name, he may give it to you.  These things I command you, so that you will love one another.  If the world hates you, know that it has hated me before it hated you.  If you were of the world, the world would love you as its own; but because you are not of the world, but I chose you out of the world, therefore the world hates you.  Remember the word that I said to you: A servant is not greater than his master. If they persecuted me, they will also persecute you. If they kept my word, they will also keep yours.  But all these things they will do to you on account of my name, because they do not know him who sent me.  If I had not come and spoken to them, they would not have been guilty of sin, but now they have no excuse for their sin.  Whoever hates me hates my Father also.  If I had not done among them the works that no one else did, they would not be guilty of sin, but now they have seen and hated both me and my Father.  But the word that is written in their Law must be fulfilled: They hated me without a cause.  But when the Helper comes, whom I will send to you from the Father, the Spirit of truth, who proceeds from the Father, he will bear witness about me.  And you also will bear witness, because you have been with me from the beginning.

\textbf{Romans 11} - I ask, then, has God rejected his people? By no means! For I myself am an Israelite, a descendant of Abraham, a member of the tribe of Benjamin. God has not rejected his people whom he foreknew. Do you not know what the Scripture says of Elijah, how he appeals to God against Israel? Lord, they have killed your prophets, they have demolished your altars, and I alone am left, and they seek my life. But what is God's reply to him? I have kept for myself seven thousand men who have not bowed the knee to Baal. So too at the present time there is a remnant, chosen by grace. But if it is by grace, it is no longer on the basis of works; otherwise grace would no longer be grace. What then? Israel failed to obtain what it was seeking. The elect obtained it, but the rest were hardened, as it is written, God gave them a spirit of stupor, eyes that would not see and ears that would not hear, down to this very day. And David says, Let their table become a snare and a trap, a stumbling block and a retribution for them; let their eyes be darkened so that they cannot see, and bend their backs forever. So I ask, did they stumble in order that they might fall? By no means! Rather through their trespass salvation has come to the Gentiles, so as to make Israel jealous. Now if their trespass means riches for the world, and if their failure means riches for the Gentiles, how much more will their full inclusion mean! Now I am speaking to you Gentiles. Inasmuch then as I am an apostle to the Gentiles, I magnify my ministry in order somehow to make my fellow Jews jealous, and thus save some of them. For if their rejection means the reconciliation of the world, what will their acceptance mean but life from the dead? If the dough offered as firstfruits is holy, so is the whole lump, and if the root is holy, so are the branches. But if some of the branches were broken off, and you, although a wild olive shoot, were grafted in among the others and now share in the nourishing root of the olive tree, do not be arrogant toward the branches. If you are, remember it is not you who support the root, but the root that supports you. Then you will say, Branches were broken off so that I might be grafted in. That is true. They were broken off because of their unbelief, but you stand fast through faith. So do not become proud, but stand in awe. For if God did not spare the natural branches, neither will he spare you. Note then the kindness and the severity of God: severity toward those who have fallen, but God's kindness to you, provided you continue in his kindness. Otherwise you too will be cut off. And even they, if they do not continue in their unbelief, will be grafted in, for God has the power to graft them in again. For if you were cut from what is by nature a wild olive tree, and grafted, contrary to nature, into a cultivated olive tree, how much more will these, the natural branches, be grafted back into their own olive tree. Lest you be wise in your own conceits, I want you to understand this mystery, brothers: a partial hardening has come upon Israel, until the fullness of the Gentiles has come in. And in this way all Israel will be saved, as it is written, The Deliverer will come from Zion, he will banish ungodliness from Jacob; and this will be my covenant with them when I take away their sins. As regards the gospel, they are enemies of God for your sake. But as regards election, they are beloved for the sake of their forefathers. For the gifts and the calling of God are irrevocable. Just as you were at one time disobedient to God but now have received mercy because of their disobedience, so they too have now been disobedient in order that by the mercy shown to you they also may now receive mercy. For God has consigned all to disobedience, that he may have mercy on all. Oh, the depth of the riches and wisdom and knowledge of God! How unsearchable are his judgments and how inscrutable his ways! For who has known the mind of the Lord, or who has been his counselor? Or who has given a gift to him that he might be repaid? For from him and through him and to him are all things. To him be glory forever. Amen. (ESV)

\textbf{Matthew 12:33-37} -  Either make the tree good and its fruit good, or make the tree bad and its fruit bad, for the tree is known by its fruit.  You brood of vipers! How can you speak good, when you are evil?  For out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks.  The good person out of his good treasure brings forth good, and the evil person out of his evil treasure brings forth evil.  I tell you, on the day of judgment people will give account for every careless word they speak, for by your words you will be justified, and by your words you will be condemned.  (ESV)

\subsubsection{The law of Christ}
\label{sec:org1af174a}
We are still \emph{under} a 'law of faith', but we are not \textbf{under} the Mosaic law.
We are under the law of Christ which is a law of faith.
But the Mosaic law still exists.

\textbf{I Corinthians 9:21} - To those outside the law I became as one outside the law (not being outside the law of God but under the law of Christ) that I might win those outside the law.

\textbf{Galatians 6:2} - Bear one another's burdens, and so fulfill the law of Christ.

\textbf{I John 3:4-11} - Everyone who makes a practice of sinning also practices lawlessness; sin is lawlessness.  You know that he appeared to take away sins, and in him there is no sin.  No one who abides in him keeps on sinning; no one who keeps on sinning has either seen him or known him.  Little children, let no one deceive you. Whoever practices righteousness is righteous, as he is righteous.  Whoever makes a practice of sinning is of the devil, for the devil has been sinning from the beginning. The reason the Son of God appeared was to destroy the works of the devil.  No one born of God makes a practice of sinning, for God's seed abides in him, and he cannot keep on sinning because he has been born of God.  By this it is evident who are the children of God, and who are the children of the devil: whoever does not practice righteousness is not of God, nor is the one who does not love his brother.  For this is the message that you have heard from the beginning, that we should love one another.

\subsection{The truth is God made them male and female, but handed erroneous, rebellious people over to their lust in impurity}
\label{sec:orgedbdd81}
\textbf{Genesis 1:27} - So God created man in his own image, in the image of God he created him; male and female he created them.

\textbf{Genesis 5:2} - Male and female he created them, and he blessed them and named them Man when they were created.

\textbf{Genesis 6:19} - And of every living thing of all flesh, you shall bring two of every sort into the ark to keep them alive with you. They shall be male and female.

\textbf{Joel 2:27-29} - You shall know that I am in the midst of Israel, and that I am the Lord your God and there is none else. And my people shall never again be put to shame.  And it shall come to pass afterward, that I will pour out my Spirit on all flesh; your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, your old men shall dream dreams, and your young men shall see visions.  Even on the male and female servants in those days I will pour out my Spirit. (ESV)

\textbf{Matthew 19:4} - He answered, Have you not read that he who created them from the beginning made them male and female, (ESV)

\textbf{Mark 10:6} - But from the beginning of creation, God made them male and female. (ESV)

\textbf{Romans 1:24-32} - Therefore God gave them up in the lusts of their hearts to impurity, to the dishonoring of their bodies among themselves, because they exchanged the truth about God for a lie and worshiped and served the creature rather than the Creator, who is blessed forever! Amen.  For this reason God gave them up to dishonorable passions.  For their women exchanged natural relations for those that are contrary to nature; and the men likewise gave up natural relations with women and were consumed with passion for one another, men committing shameless acts with men and receiving in themselves the due penalty for their error.  And since they did not see fit to acknowledge God, God gave them up to a debased mind to do what ought not to be done.  They were filled with all manner of unrighteousness, evil, covetousness, malice.  They are full of envy, murder, strife, deceit, maliciousness.  They are gossips, slanderers, haters of God, insolent, haughty, boastful, inventors of evil, disobedient to parents, foolish, faithless, heartless, ruthless.  Though they know God's decree that those who practice such things deserve to die, they not only do them but give approval to those who practice them.  (ESV)

\subsection{I do not endorse gay marriage}
\label{sec:orgb35dd9c}
I personally do not endorse gay marriage. When I have in the past, I repent of that. That is not to say it is not possible to endorse it yourself but a person is accountable to God for that act of annulling one of His commandments.

In the manner in which I judge, I know I will be judged. So I believe that because I do not / no longer endorse gay marriage for others, I do not endorse it for myself, and I'll be held to that standard.

\textbf{Matthew 5:14} - You are the light of the world.  A city set on a hill cannot be hidden.  (ESV)

I know I am called to exercise personal righteousness/holiness as the light of the world. I believe that God's grace extends to all who put their faith in Jesus and have Jesus' righteousness imputed onto them, the righteousness of faith in Jesus Christ God's Son who has paid through his blood the price for our sin.

I believe one must know that God's law is right and when presented with God's law, they recognise that the law is right and recognise their transgression.

And no-one should endorse sinful things. Homosexuality is erroneous.
If they do, however, endorse it then I think that inhibits them from approaching God.

I feel as though I have been robbed in my life of normal Christian marriage by endorsing it for others in the past.

\subsection{Belief comes before or at the time of receiving the Holy Spirit (receiving the Holy Spirit comes at the time of or after believing)}
\label{sec:org28e4e69}
I believe that the Holy Spirit goes to those who obey God. I believe belief in Jesus comes first.

\textbf{Acts 2:38} - And Peter said to them, Repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins, and you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit. (ESV)

\textbf{Acts 5:32} - And we are witnesses to these things, and so is the Holy Spirit, whom God has given to those who obey him. (ESV)

Belief in Jesus comes first but receiving the Holy Spirit and baptism may happen in any order after that.

I think this is generally the order of things.

\subsection{God is sovereign to reveal Himself.}
\label{sec:org6a58cc3}

\textbf{Romans 10:20} - Then Isaiah is so bold as to say, I have been found by those who did not seek me; I have shown myself to those who did not ask for me. (ESV)

I also believe 1 Cor 12:3.

\subsection{Outside of the Holy Spirit, noone can say Jesus is Lord}
\label{sec:orgd271d3e}

\textbf{1 Corinthians 12:3} - Therefore I want you to understand that no one speaking in the Spirit of God ever says Jesus is accursed! and no one can say Jesus is Lord except in the Holy Spirit. (ESV)

\subsection{Works accompany the true believers}
\label{sec:org8a1f7f0}
\textbf{Mark 16:16-17} - Whoever believes and is baptized will be saved, but whoever does not believe will be condemned. And these signs will accompany those who believe: in my name they will cast out demons; they will speak in new tongues; (ESV)

\subsection{Those that reject the gospel are not the same as those who haven't heard the gospel}
\label{sec:org9941ef3}
\textbf{Mark 6:11} - And if any place will not receive you and they will not listen to you, when you leave, shake off the dust that is on your feet as a testimony against them.

\textbf{John 13:20} - Truly, truly, I say to you, whoever receives the one I send receives me, and whoever receives me receives the one who sent me.

\textbf{Matthew 10:40} - “He who receives you receives Me, and he who receives Me receives Him who sent Me.

\textbf{Mark 9:37} - “Whoever receives one child like this in My name receives Me; and whoever receives Me does not receive Me, but Him who sent Me.”

I lean towards this interpretation:

People who hear the gospel and reject it / reject Jesus / choose to not believe are condemned.

\subsection{I believe that repentance is important in faith and faithfulness to God (lots of people say these days that trying to follow the law is self-righteousness; they believe good is evil), but following the law in faith is OK}
\label{sec:orge514451}

\textbf{Matthew 21:32} - For John came to you in the way of righteousness, and you did not believe him, but the tax collectors and the prostitutes believed him. And even when you saw it, you did not afterward change your minds and believe him. (ESV)

\textbf{Acts 2:38} - And Peter said to them, Repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins, and you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit. (ESV)

Basic repentance is 'metanoia' (a change of mind) - it's part of belief.
But this is what repentance looks like.

\textbf{Joel 2:12-13} - Yet even now, declares the LORD, return to me with all your heart, with fasting, with weeping, and with mourning; and rend your hearts and not your garments. Return to the LORD, your God, for he is gracious and merciful, slow to anger, and abounding in steadfast love; and he relents over disaster. (ESV)

And repentance has the fruit of in your heart truly deciding to tell the truth, not commit adultery, etc. - being accountable to God, knowing that He sees.

\textbf{Matthew 3:8} - Bear fruit in keeping with repentance.  (ESV)

This is following the law by faith, I think; Truly loving God and one's neighbour.

\textbf{Romans 14:23} - But whoever has doubts is condemned if he eats, because the eating is not from faith. For whatever does not proceed from faith is sin. (ESV)

\subsection{Celebrating/endorsing sin / error is not right}
\label{sec:orgc4d8574}

If a newly born-again Christian is spending all their time with sinners though and endorsing continually instead of being discipled, then they can
have their mind conformed to the sinners instead of being strengthened in the truth. This is why I think it's not especially great to, immediately after getting born-again,
be overly exposed to unbelievers and sinners.

Jesus ate with sinners but Jesus was the special guest. Think of Nicodemus inviting Jesus over.

\subsection{Faith has substance to it, and an amount to it, usually drawn out over time}
\label{sec:orgfdfded8}
\textbf{Hebrews 11:1} - Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen. (KJV)

For me, I was acting in faith ever since I was born-again, resulting in a huge chain of events and confirmations!

\subsection{Faith believes God and hopes in invisible things, and is convicted of them}
\label{sec:orge7c369f}

But at the end of the day, justification by faith in Jesus justifies the ungodly sinner - but it is faith that justifies and not faithlessness. It's the type of belief that recognises one's sin, and results in love for Jesus, and it's obedient and submissive to God - it's repentant.

\textbf{Hebrews 11:6} - And without faith it is impossible to please him, for whoever would draw near to God must believe that he exists and that he rewards those who seek him. (ESV)

Where we are unfaithful, though, God is faithful. God wants us to choose Him. He wants us to repent.

\subsection{Who chooses who? I believe Jesus chose me and I also chose Jesus}
\label{sec:orga465ddb}
\textbf{John 15:16} - You did not choose me, but I chose you and appointed you that you should go and bear fruit and that your fruit should abide, so that whatever you ask the Father in my name, he may give it to you. (ESV)

\subsection{Structure of the Kingdom}
\label{sec:org9ad3422}

The law still exists. A thought I have : "Perhaps structure of God's kingdom might be determined by the law and Jesus' words."

\textbf{Hebrews 1:3} - He is the radiance of the glory of God and the exact imprint of his nature, and he upholds the universe by the word of his power. After making purification for sins, he sat down at the right hand of the Majesty on high, (ESV)

\textbf{Psalms 89:14} - Righteousness and justice are the foundation of your throne; steadfast love and faithfulness go before you. (ESV)

\textbf{Revelation of John 20:4} - Then I saw thrones, and seated on them were those to whom the authority to judge was committed. Also I saw the souls of those who had been beheaded for the testimony of Jesus and for the word of God, and who had not worshiped the beast or its image and had not received its mark on their foreheads or their hands. They came to life and reigned with Christ for a thousand years.

\subsection{There is no sexual immorality in heaven, no violence, no sinners.}
\label{sec:orga63110a}

\textbf{Revelation 21:22-27} - And I saw no temple in the city, for its temple is the Lord God the Almighty and the Lamb. And the city has no need of sun or moon to shine on it, for the glory of God gives it light, and its lamp is the Lamb. By its light will the nations walk, and the kings of the earth will bring their glory into it, and its gates will never be shut by day—and there will be no night there. They will bring into it the glory and the honor of the nations. But nothing unclean will ever enter it, nor anyone who does what is detestable or false, but only those who are written in the Lamb's book of life. (ESV)

\textbf{Isaiah 11:6} - The wolf shall dwell with the lamb, and the leopard shall lie down with the young goat, and the calf and the lion and the fattened calf together; and a little child shall lead them. (ESV)

\textbf{Matthew 22:30} - For in the resurrection they neither marry nor are given in marriage, but are like angels in heaven.

\subsection{Adhering to the law like a Pharisee - pursuing the law by works}
\label{sec:org69dafbb}
But adhering to the law like a Pharisee is like strapping yourself to a razor blade, but that doesn't mean the law is wrong.

\textbf{Romans 3:20} - For by works of the law no human being will be justified in his sight, since through the law comes knowledge of sin.

\subsection{Follow the law mercifully and without self-righteousness, accountable to God, being a servant to others}
\label{sec:org7cafcf2}
So as to not become a hypocrite or condemn the innocent.
Accountable to God - a relationship with God.
Without self-righteousness.

\textbf{Acts 23:3} - Then Paul said to him, God is going to strike you, you whitewashed wall! Are you sitting to judge me according to the law, and yet contrary to the law you order me to be struck?

\textbf{Matthew 12:3-8} - He said to them, Have you not read what David did when he was hungry, and those who were with him: how he entered the house of God and ate the bread of the Presence, which it was not lawful for him to eat nor for those who were with him, but only for the priests?  Or have you not read in the Law how on the Sabbath the priests in the temple profane the Sabbath and are guiltless?  I tell you, something greater than the temple is here.  And if you had known what this means, I desire mercy, and not sacrifice, you would not have condemned the guiltless.  For the Son of Man is lord of the Sabbath.

The greatest among you will be your servant.
Keeping the commandments by faith results in a person a who is a servant, serving others.

\textbf{Luke 22:26} - But it is not this way with you, but the one who is the greatest among you must become like the youngest, and the leader like the servant.

\textbf{Matthew 5:19} - Therefore whoever relaxes one of the least of these commandments and teaches others to do the same will be called least in the kingdom of heaven, but whoever does them and teaches them will be called great in the kingdom of heaven.

Not the best example, but, for example, when someone says you owe them money, and you can see they are blind, it's paying them because you're the one submitting to God.
It's humbling yourself even to others and following God's commandments in truth and reality, with a real faith relationship with God.
It's serving others as Jesus has served us.
It's keeping accountable to God and maintaining faithfulness to God, not keeping others accountable to you.

This isn't self-righteousness, but is a self-sacrificial obedience to continue working as a bond-servant of Christ, being the light of the world.

\subsection{All the law is still used}
\label{sec:orgfa57bdb}
The law is good and it still exists, and God still uses the law. All of it. We are supposed to stand for truth and live righteously as the light of the world.

That being said, we all fall short of the glory of God.
Jesus Christ is the end of the law to all who believe, but grace isn't an excuse to sin.

\subsubsection{Even the smallest of laws still come into effect in certain circumstances}
\label{sec:orgb1f0fc8}

\textbf{Leviticus 19:27} - You shall not round off the hair on your temples or mar the edges of your beard. (ESV)

For example, if Jesus sends you as an ambassador to some pagans and they asked you to shave your head in this specific way, or eat food sacrificed to idols.

\subsection{Justification by faith - Jews + Gentiles, and in-between}
\label{sec:orgaafc30a}
Justification by faith is the correct teaching but the promise is for the gentiles AND the adherent of the law but they all must have faith, and pursuing the law as if by works is the problem, but pursuing the law by faith is ok.

I believe in-between is OK, so long as it is by faith.

\textbf{Romans 7:22} - For I delight in the law of God, in my inner being, (ESV)

\textbf{Romans 9:30-32} - What shall we say, then? That Gentiles who did not pursue righteousness have attained it, that is, a righteousness that is by faith; but that Israel who pursued a law that would lead to righteousness did not succeed in reaching that law. Why? Because they did not pursue it by faith, but as if it were based on works. They have stumbled over the stumbling stone, (ESV)

\textbf{Romans 4:15-16} - For the law brings wrath, but where there is no law there is no transgression. That is why it depends on faith, in order that the promise may rest on grace and be guaranteed to all his offspring—not only to the adherent of the law but also to the one who shares the faith of Abraham, who is the father of us all, (ESV)

\textbf{Matthew 5:17-25} - Do not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them. For truly, I say to you, until heaven and earth pass away, not an iota, not a dot, will pass from the Law until all is accomplished. Therefore whoever relaxes one of the least of these commandments and teaches others to do the same will be called least in the kingdom of heaven, but whoever does them and teaches them will be called great in the kingdom of heaven. For I tell you, unless your righteousness exceeds that of the scribes and Pharisees, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven. You have heard that it was said to those of old, You shall not murder; and whoever murders will be liable to judgment. But I say to you that everyone who is angry with his brother will be liable to judgment; whoever insults his brother will be liable to the council; and whoever says, You fool! will be liable to the hell of fire. So if you are offering your gift at the altar and there remember that your brother has something against you, leave your gift there before the altar and go. First be reconciled to your brother, and then come and offer your gift. Come to terms quickly with your accuser while you are going with him to court, lest your accuser hand you over to the judge, and the judge to the guard, and you be put in prison. (ESV)

\subsection{Theoretically belief usually comes before or at the time receiving the Holy Spirit}
\label{sec:orgc917199}
But for me I believe before I was born-again and before I was baptised in the Holy Spirit.

\textbf{Acts 19:1-7} - And it happened that while Apollos was at Corinth, Paul passed through the inland country and came to Ephesus.  There he found some disciples.  And he said to them, Did you receive the Holy Spirit when you believed?  And they said, No, we have not even heard that there is a Holy Spirit.  And he said, Into what then were you baptized?  They said, Into John's baptism.  And Paul said, John baptized with the baptism of repentance, telling the people to believe in the one who was to come after him, that is, Jesus. On hearing this, they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus. And when Paul had laid his hands on them, the Holy Spirit came on them, and they began speaking in tongues and prophesying. There were about twelve men in all.  (ESV)

\section{Receive through the hearing of the word and faith}
\label{sec:org491094b}
\textbf{Galatians 3:2} - Let me ask you only this: Did you receive the Spirit by works of the law or by hearing with faith? (ESV)

Not just by hearing but by hearing with faith.

\subsection{The promised Spirit is received through faith}
\label{sec:org5b89b88}
\textbf{Galatians 3:14} - so that in Christ Jesus the blessing of Abraham might come to the Gentiles, so that we might receive the promised Spirit through faith.  (ESV)

\subsection{Justification by faith for the both adherents of the law and the gentiles}
\label{sec:org2ab57a8}
Justification by faith is the correct teaching but the promise is for the gentiles AND the adherent of the law but they all must have faith, and pursuing the law as if by works is the problem, but pursuing the law by faith is ok.

\textbf{Romans 7:22} - For I delight in the law of God, in my inner being, (ESV)

\textbf{Romans 9:30-32} - What shall we say, then? That Gentiles who did not pursue righteousness have attained it, that is, a righteousness that is by faith; but that Israel who pursued a law that would lead to righteousness did not succeed in reaching that law. Why? Because they did not pursue it by faith, but as if it were based on works. They have stumbled over the stumbling stone, (ESV)

\textbf{Romans 4:15-16} - For the law brings wrath, but where there is no law there is no transgression. That is why it depends on faith, in order that the promise may rest on grace and be guaranteed to all his offspring—not only to the adherent of the law but also to the one who shares the faith of Abraham, who is the father of us all, (ESV)

\subsection{Paul used the law to judge back, but without hypocrisy}
\label{sec:orga861e49}
\textbf{Matthew 23:27} - Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you are like whitewashed tombs, which outwardly appear beautiful, but within are full of dead people's bones and all uncleanness.

\textbf{Acts 23:3} - Then Paul said to him, God is going to strike you, you whitewashed wall! Are you sitting to judge me according to the law, and yet contrary to the law you order me to be struck?

\subsection{Justified by faith alone}
\label{sec:orgd9d589d}
Predestined, called, justified, glorified - sounds like election.

\textbf{Romans 8:30} - And those whom he predestined he also called, and those whom he called he also justified, and those whom he justified he also glorified. (ESV)

But repentance is a work of the heart which is an act of faith.
I believe repentance is inseparable from faith because intrinsic to faith is belief and intrinsic to belief is metanoia (changing one's mind).

At it's most basic form repentance means a person believes in Jesus as the Son of God and the Messiah who, being innocent, paid the price for their sin through His broken body and shed blood on the cross - a perfect and eternal offering; that He died there but God resurrected Him, and He is Lord of Heaven and Earth.

But I believe we are forgiven to forgive others. That must be part of the act of faith and the change of heart, I think.

\textbf{Matthew 6:15} - but if you do not forgive others their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses.  (ESV)

\subsection{Then, glorification}
\label{sec:orgb0af55c}
Glorification is the good works including forgiving others.

Forgiving others, walking righteously, and doing good works glorifies Jesus and glorifies God.

\subsubsection{Forgive others' offenses towards you}
\label{sec:org520bb70}
\textbf{Proverbs 19:11} - Good sense makes one slow to anger, and it is his glory to overlook an offense. (ESV)

\textbf{Ephesians 4:32} - Be kind to one another, tenderhearted, forgiving one another, as God in Christ forgave you. (ESV)

\subsubsection{Be extremely generous}
\label{sec:org11ad1e0}
\textbf{Matthew 10:8} - Heal the sick, raise the dead, cleanse lepers, cast out demons. You received without paying; give without pay. (ESV)

\subsubsection{Do the good works which have been gifted to you}
\label{sec:org3f78e7c}
\textbf{Ephesians 2:10} - For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God prepared beforehand, that we should walk in them.  (ESV)

\textbf{Matthew 5:16} - In the same way, let your light shine before others, so that they may see your good works and give glory to your Father who is in heaven.  (ESV)

\subsubsection{Walk in righteousness}
\label{sec:orgdb5e685}

\textbf{Daniel 12:3} -  And those who are wise shall shine like the brightness of the sky above; and those who turn many to righteousness, like the stars forever and ever.  (ESV)

\subsubsection{I think to relax commandments is throw away glorification}
\label{sec:org6edbd07}
\textbf{Matthew 5:19} -  Therefore whoever relaxes one of the least of these commandments and teaches others to do the same will be called least in the kingdom of heaven, but whoever does them and teaches them will be called great in the kingdom of heaven.  (ESV)
