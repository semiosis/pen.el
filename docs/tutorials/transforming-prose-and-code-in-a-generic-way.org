#+TITLE: Transforming prose and code, in a generic way
#+DATE: <2021-08-29>
#+AUTHOR: Shane Mulligan
#+KEYWORDS: gpt pen codex davinci gpt openai

** Summary
I demonstrate two prompts I have made. The
first is based on OpenAI's Davinci and I use
it to transform prose. The other is based on
OpenAI's Davinci-Codex and I use it to
transform code.

The prompts are parameterised to accept a NL
description of a transformation to make.
Rather than creating individual prompts for
specific transformations or types of
transformations, I simply have 2 generic
transformation prompts.

Davinci appears to be more adept at
transforming prose due to not to have had any
fine-tuning which distracts it from its world-
language oriented tasks.

Davinci-Codex, on the other hand, while being
able to employ other languages as a means of
controlling the generation of text, appears to
be less reliable at transforming prose
correctly, but more controllable in terms of
controlling the structure of its output.

Davinci-Codex also does a much better job at
transforming code with NL. That much should be
obvious.

** Transform prose
- Prose is still difficult to control.
- I've cherry picked these generations which came from the same batch.

*** Original
#+BEGIN_SRC text -n :async :results verbatim code
  No matter what you are looking at in the terminal, generate from it at the
  cursor position with previous text as context, and fuzzy search within that.
#+END_SRC

*** Generated
#+BEGIN_SRC text -n :async :results verbatim code
  adorn it with flowery and figurative language
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_SRC text -n :async :results verbatim code
  No matter what you are looking at in the
  terminal, a mouse click away is its previous
  context and a fuzzy search within that
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_SRC text -n :async :results verbatim code
  No matter what you are looking at in the
  terminal, generate from it at the cursor
  position with previous text as context, and
  fuzzy search within that
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_SRC text -n :async :results verbatim code
  Everywhere we look, whether we are using the
  command line or some sort of graphical user
  interface, we should always be able to
  generate that information at the cursor
  position with previous information as context.
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_SRC text -n :async :results verbatim code
  No matter what you are looking at in the
  terminal, generate from it at the cursor
  position with previous text as context, and
  fuzzy search within that for the pre-existing
  text of a self-quoted command

** Transform code
Code transformation with Codex is beyond belief; It's very powerful and accurate.

  	for ($blue = 0; $blue < 6; $blue++) {
  	    $code = 16 + ($red * 36) + ($green * 6) + $blue;
  	    printf($line1, $code);
  	    printf($line2, $code);
