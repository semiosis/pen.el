#+TITLE: Explain the grammar of Prolog or any BNF
#+DATE: <2021-10-17>
#+AUTHOR: Shane Mulligan
#+KEYWORDS: codex pen

** Summary
I use Codex to explain a language's grammar.

      We specify the <language name> syntax using Backus–Naur form.

      A program is a sequence of one or more
      variable declarations, followed by a
      sequence of one or more procedure
      declarations.

** Example result
This is an example of the above grammar, which is Prolog.

#+BEGIN_SRC text -n :async :results verbatim code
  A program is either a clause list
  followed by a query, or a query
  alone.
  
  A clause list is either a clause,
  or a clause list followed by a
  clause.
  
  A clause is either a predicate
  followed by a period, or a
  predicate followed by a colon
  followed by a predicate list
  followed by a period.
  
  A predicate list is either a predicate,
  or a predicate list followed by a
  comma followed by a predicate.
  
  A predicate is either an atom,
  or an atom followed by an open
  parenthesis followed by a term
  list followed by a close
  parenthesis.
  
  A term list is either a term,
  or a term list followed by a comma
  followed by a term.
  
  A term is either a numeral,
  or an atom, or a variable, or a
  structure.
  
  A structure is either an atom
  followed by an open parenthesis
  followed by a term list followed by
  a close parenthesis.
  
  A query is either a question mark
  followed by a predicate list, or
  just a question mark.

Another explanation:

#+BEGIN_SRC text -n :async :results verbatim code
  A program is either a clause list
  and a query, or just a query.
  
  A clause list is a sequence of clauses.
  A clause is either a predicate followed
  by a period, or a predicate followed by
  a ":-" followed by a predicate list.
  
  A predicate list is a sequence of predicates.
  A predicate is either an atom or an atom
  followed by an open parenthesis, followed
  by a term list, followed by a close
  parenthesis.
  
  A term list is a sequence of terms.
  A term is either a numeral, an atom, a
  variable, or a structure.
  
  A structure is either an atom followed by
  an open parenthesis, followed by a term list,
  followed by a close parenthesis.
  
  A query is either a "?-" followed by a
  predicate list, or just a predicate list.
  
  An atom is either a small atom or a quoted
  string.
  
  A small atom is either a lowercase letter,
  or a small atom followed by a character.
  
  A variable is either an uppercase letter,
  or a variable followed by a character.
  
  A numeral is either a single digit, or a
  numeral followed by a digit.
  
  A character is either a lowercase letter,
  an uppercase letter, a digit, or one of
  the following symbols: + - * / \ ^ ~ : . ? # $ &
  
  A string is a character sequence surrounded
  by single quotes.
