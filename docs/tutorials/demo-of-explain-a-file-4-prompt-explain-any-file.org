** Explain any file demo
*** Question
I'm just getting started with this type of
prompt engineering so apologies for the noob
question. I do think is awesome. I'm trying to
use https://github.com/semiosis/prompts/blob/master/prompts/explain-a-file-4.prompt to
explain any github repo but I cannot get the
right completion. Wondering if you have any
examples I can reference to. Thanks!

*** Answer
I just ran the
https://github.com/semiosis/prompts/blob/master/prompts/explain-a-file-4.prompt 
prompt on the following file: 
http://github.com/semiosis/pen.el/blob/master/docker-compose.yml

As a result, the following text was generated as the final prompt:
#+BEGIN_SRC text -n :async :results verbatim code
  $ ls | head -n 10
  CHANGELOG.org
  config
  CONTRIBUTING.org
  docker-compose.yml
  Dockerfile
  docs
  examples
  glossary.txt
  LICENSE
  Makefile
  
  $ ls ..
  Barliman
  dni
  engines
  examplary
  fine-tuning-gpt-3
  glossaries
  glossaries-gh
  huggingface-clj
  huggingface.el
  ilambda
  
  $ cat "docker-compose.yml" <<EOD
  version: "3.9"
  services:
    pen:
      build: .
      ports:
        - "57575:57575"
    semantic:
      image: "docker.pkg.github.com/github/semantic/semantic:latest"
      restart: always
    duckling:
      image: rasa/duckling:0.1.6.5
      restart: always
      ports:
        - 8000:8000
  EOD
  
  $ cat "README for docker-compose.yml.md" <<EOD
  # "docker-compose.yml"
  ## Explanation of code
#+END_SRC

=Pen.el= then completes the above final prompt producing the following generated readme file:
#+BEGIN_SRC text -n :async :results verbatim code
  # "docker-compose.yml"
  ## Explanation of code
  ### Naming
  - pen = the pen,
  - semantic = the `semantic-ui` website,
  - duckling = the duckling service,
  
  This is the same file from `semantic-ui` and the `duckling` example.
  
  ### `semantic`
  - `semantic` is a static website. It does not do anything on its own.
  - It just serves static files from one or more sources.
  - We can use it to serve the files from the `semantic-ui` github site:
  <!--
      semantic:
        image: "docker.pkg.github.com/github/semantic/semantic:latest"
        restart: always
  -->
  
  ### `duckling`
  - `duckling` is an `rasa` service.
  - The files are fetched from `rasa/duckling` which is the source code on github.
  - See `rasa/duckling` in the `huggingface` repo.
  
  - `docker run -p 8000:8000 rasa/duckling:0.1.6.5`
  
  <!--
    duckling:
      image: rasa/duckling:0.1.6.5
      restart: always
      ports:
        - 8000:8000
  -->
  
  The static website runs
