** Quick Setup using Docker
[[./wizard4.png]]

/A time-traveling wizard who uses a magic book and pen to create worlds./

The following commands set up =pen.el= for the first time.

+ Apply for a GPT-3 key :: https://beta.openai.com/

+ Apply for an AI-21 key :: https://www.ai21.com/

+ Apply for a Cohere key :: https://cohere.ai/

# + Free AIx GPT-J-6B key :: https://apps.aixsolutionsgroup.com/
#   The AIx API is under heavy development. Multiple completions is currently being emulated by making several calls.
#   Therefore, =Pen.el= will seem less responsive with GPT-J, currently.

These are the steps to run =Pen= on a linux
machine. It will use a docker image. See the
bottom of this document for Windows
instructions.

** Invoking =Pen.el=: Client and server
Please glance over this to learn how to invoke.

It'll get you going with =Pen.el= very quickly.

https://mullikine.github.io/posts/pen-el-host-interop-and-client-server/

The essence is you simply run the =pen= script
and it takes care of running the emacs+docker server.

** Configuration
For linux users, if you place your OpenAI API
key in the file =~/.pen/openai_api_key=, the 
[[https://github.com/semiosis/pen.el/blob/master/scripts/pen][pen shell script]] will
automatically pick that up.

If you run =pen= in a directory that contains a [[https://github.com/semiosis/prompts/tree/master/prompts][prompts repository]] then that repository will be used by =pen.el=.
That way you can persist changes to your prompts repository.

If you run =pen= in a directory containing a [[https://github.com/semiosis/pen.el/blob/master/src/pen.el][pen.el repository]] then that code will be what is run in the docker, rather than the =pen.el= contained within.

You may save files to the =~/.pen= directory
within the docker and those files will be
accessible to the host and will not be erased.

** Running =Pen.el= from the host, in bash
With a server running, you have these commands available on the host:

| Script name | Function                                             | Example                                                  |

| =pene=      | Run some emacs code from the host and get the result | =pene '(progn (message "hi") (message "yo"))'=           |
| =penq=      | Quit the server                                      | =penq=                                                   |
| =penf=      | Run a prompt function                                | =penf -u write-a-blog-post sky 300=                      |

=H= is the Hyper key, which works similar to Escape, Meta, Alt, Control or Shift that is present on the Space Cadet Keyboard.

=pen.el= emulates a Hyper key (=H-=) with =C-M-\=.

I like =Hyper= because you're writing =hyperreality=.

#+BEGIN_SRC text -n :async :results verbatim code
  hyperreality
      [#semiotics]
      [#postmodernism]

      An inability of consciousness to
      distinguish reality from a simulation of
      reality, especially in technologically
      advanced postmodern societies.

*** Usage
Running =pen-generate-prompt-functions= will
load all prompts from the prompts directory,
which is typically located here: =~/.emacs.d/prompts=.

Running =pen-run-prompt-function= will run a prompt function.

You may also press =SPC= while some text is selected to run a prompt function.

This is a prompt which, given text selected
will output the language that text is in.

It works for both world languages and for code.

The =title= of the prompt will be
[[https://pypi.org/project/python-slugify/][slugified]] and used as the name of
the prompt function.

=doc= and =notes= will both go into the
documentation for the function.

The prompt is using the =Input= =Output=
pattern.

=engine= is the name of a language model.

An API such as the =OpenAI API= (=GPT-3=) may serve
several different models.

+ Some alternative models for =GPT-3=:
  - babbage
  - content-filter-alpha-c4
  - content-filter-dev
  - curie
  - cursing-filter-v6
  - davinci
  - instruct-curie-beta
  - instruct-davinci-beta

=vars= is a list of variable names. Each
variable is substituted into the prompt if it
has a corresponding template placeholder.

For example, the =<1>= in the prompt
corresponds to where the first variable
(=text-or-code=) will be substituted.

=examples= is a list with the same number of
elements as =vars=. The values in =examples=
may be suggested as initial input when
running the prompt function and may be used in
test cases. They also serve as documentation
for the user.

=preprocessors= are a list of shell
pipelineable commands (stream filters) which
expect both input and output and can be used
to preprocess the variables before they are
substituted into the prompt template.

This prompt doesn't have a =postprocessor=,
but if it did it would postprocess the
returned completions in a similar fashion to
how the variables are preprocessed.

Finally, =aliases= is a list of alternative
function names for this prompt.

*** Prompt Engineering Workflow

+ Setup
  - Install =prompt= snippet into yasnippet.
  - M-x =yas/reload-all=
  - M-x =yas-insert-snippet=

+ Prompt design
  - 1. Come up with a task. Let's call it "Negate sentence"
  - 2. Insert the prompt snippet into a new prompt file.
  - 3. Remove keys from prompts file which we don't need.
  - 4. =var-defaults= is an advanced usage of prompts
    - But we will remove them
  - 5. Now load the prompt with =M-x pen-generate-prompt-functions=
  - 6. Now look at the prompt function documentation
    - The binding =C-h C-f= is used to bring up help for a function
  - 7. Looks like we made an error: "The Mars is very far away."
    - Change it and update the version of the prompt
  - 8. Reload functions

Test it out.

Maori isn't a very prominent language on the
web, but it still managed to capture the idea
of a welcome message, which I think is
amazing! I am Maori, so I appreciate this!

I want to demonstrate the usage of two more =.prompt= keys.

+ The technical jargon :: =var-defaults= overrides the default behaviour of the =(interactive)= form in emacs.

By specifying =var-defaults=, you can change
what functions or expressions are run to
acquire the values for the parameters to the
prompt.

The prompt here captures the selected text and
puts it into the second placeholder, =<2>=.

By default, that would go into the first one, =<1>=.

#+BEGIN_SRC yaml -n :async :results verbatim code
var-defaults:
- "(read-string \"language: \")"
- "(pen-selected-text)"
#+END_SRC

The =prompt-filter= is a final filter script
to transform the prompt before sending to the
=API= / =LM= for completion.

** Using prompt functions in your code
Prompt functions automatically 'curry' when
you leave out their arguments.

Here is an example, =pf-translate-from-world-language-x-to-y=:

#+BEGIN_SRC text -n :async :results verbatim code
  pf-translate-from-world-language-x-to-y is an interactive function
  defined in pen-example-config.el.

  Signature
  (pf-translate-from-world-language-x-to-y &optional FROM-LANGUAGE TO-LANGUAGE PHRASE)

  Documentation
  Translate from world language X to Y
  This prompt translates English text to any world langauge

  path:
  - /home/shane/source/git/spacemacs/prompts/prompts/translate-world-languages.prompt

  examples:
  - English
  - French
  - Goodnight

  preprocessors:
  - cat
  - cat
  - sed -z 's/\n/\\n/g'

  var-defaults:
  - (read-string-hist "Pen From language: ")
  - (read-string-hist "Pen To language: ")
  - (pen-selected-text)

  prompt-filter:
  - pen-c ascify
#+END_SRC

If this function is run without a selection
then =pen-selected-text= will resort to asking
the user for input.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp -n :async :results verbatim code
  ;; Leave out all arguments to be prompted for each argument
  (pf-translate-from-world-language-x-to-y)
#+END_SRC

The following default functions / expressions
(i.e. =var-defaults=) are run when called
interactively or to acquire the values of
optional parameters that were left out of the
call to the prompt function.

#+BEGIN_SRC yaml -n :async :results verbatim code
  var-defaults:
  - "(read-string-hist \"Pen From language: \")"
  - "(read-string-hist \"Pen To language: \")"
  - "(pen-selected-text)"
#+END_SRC

The following invocation supplies ="French"=
as the first parameter, but the others will be
requested.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp -n :async :results verbatim code
  (pf-translate-from-world-language-x-to-y "French")
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_SRC text -n :async :results verbatim code

** Current Development
*** =company-mode=
I'm trying to do something a little more
ambitious than simply having a single
completion function.

There will be infinitely many completion functions that you can select from.

*** HuggingFace transformers
Mark Watson in his book "Practical Artificial
Intelligence Programming With Clojure" uses
spaCy and the HuggingFace transformers library
from Clojure. I would like to connect to
HuggingFace's transformers library in this way.
