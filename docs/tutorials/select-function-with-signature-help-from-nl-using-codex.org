#+TITLE: Select function (with signature help) from NL using Codex
#+DATE: <2021-08-31>
#+AUTHOR: Shane Mulligan
#+KEYWORDS: gpt openai codex pen

** Summary
I create a handy function to suggest functions along with signature help, using Codex.

** elisp
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp -n :async :results verbatim code
  (defun pen-select-function-from-nl (use-case)
    (interactive (list (read-string "pen-select-function-from-nl use-case: ")))
    (let* ((lang ;; (pen-detect-language-ask)
            (read-string-hist "pen-select-function-from-nl lang: "))
           (funs (pf-find-a-function-given-a-use-case/2 lang use-case :no-select-result t))
           (sigs (pf-get-the-signatures-for-a-list-of-functions/2 lang (list2str funs) :no-select-result t)))
      (xc (fz (-zip-lists funs sigs) nil nil "pen-select-function-from-nl: "))))

*** Ask the tutor some questions
/How do I parse a date?/

+ An aside :: With Davinci the topic+subtopic tutor does well, but not with Codex.

#+BEGIN_SRC text -n :async :results verbatim code
  You can parse a date using the format
  function, but you should not use the default
  RecordParser, you need to use the FieldParser
  When given a format string, such as 'yyyy-MM-
  dd' (year, month, day), you should use the
  'parseDateFromString' function.
  
  And you can read about it here: http://www.has
  kell.org/haskellwiki/Parsec#Format_strings ##
  So to parse "2010-01-10" you would use:

/What is a monad?/

The tutor gives the meme description of a monad (functor in the category of endofunctors)!

#+BEGIN_SRC text -n :async :results verbatim code
  Monads are a type of algebraic structure used
  to create a category of actions, where each
  action is an object in the category.
  
  Monads are a very useful concept in functional
  programming.
  
  A monad is a functor in the category of
  endofunctors, or a category in which every
  endofunctor is a functor.
  
  Monads also allow for the abstraction of the
  "state" of a program at a given time.
  
  Different variants of monads include
  conceptually "state" monads, continuation
  monads, Reader monads, Writer monads, and
  various others.

*** Ask the tutor about python
/How do I manage a pool of threads?/

#+BEGIN_SRC text -n :async :results verbatim code
  Well, there are a few ways to manage a pool
  of threads.
  
  I can explain them to you.
  
  AI: The first way to manage a pool of threads
  is to use a ThreadPoolExecutor.
  
  This is a special kind of an ExecutorService
  that is meant to be used for executing threads
  in a pool.
  
  You can configure a ThreadPoolExecutor with a
  corePoolSize and a maximumPoolSize.
  
  The corePoolSize is the thread pool size that
  is kept even if the pool is empty and the
  queue is full.
  
  The maximumPoolSize is the maximum number of
  threads that can be in the pool.
  
  The initialPoolSize is the number of threads
  that are created when the thread pool is
  created.
  
  If the initialPoolSize is greater than zero,
  then that many threads are created.
  
  If the initialPoolSize is zero, the number of
  threads is the sum of the values of the
  corePoolSize and the maximumPoolSize.
  
  The keepAliveTime is the amount of time that
  threads in the pool stay alive if there are no
  tasks to do (or time-out).
  
  The maxQueueSize is the max number of tasks
  that can wait in the queue.
  
  The constantPoolSize is an upper bound on the
  number of threads that will ever be in the
  pool.
  
  If there are more threads in the pool than the
  constantPoolSize, then the pool has a larger
  constantPoolSize.
