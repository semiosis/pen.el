** Introducing =Pen.el=
/The pen of imagination - |:ϝ∷¦ϝ./

[[./the_pen_of_imagination.png]]

+ See most recent tutorial :: https://semiosis.github.io/posts/pen-el-tutorial/

=Pen.el= integrates LMs (Language Models) such as OpenAI's
=GPT-3= or EleutherAI's =GPT-J= into emacs by
generating functions from prompts that map
emacs's corners loosely onto LMs. These
functions can be used interactively or non-
interactively and in a variety of configurable
ways. =Pen.el= also facilitates the creation,
development, discovery and usage of prompts.
It's completely free, libre and open-source.

** Further introduction
=Pen.el= is Google search, stackoverflow,
Grammarly, Copilot, =conversion.ai=, mind
mapping software (based on GPT-3) etc. all
rolled into one package and allows you to
extend emacs with GPT wherever your mind takes
you. It's a LM (Language Model) that can generate
multiversal continuations of text according to
probability from the data that it was trained
on.

=Pen.el's= domain specific language =examplary= also helps
you to generate your own prompts using known
design patterns and minimal inputs and
description. It does this by weaving prompt
functions into each other.

** Vision
At its heart, emacs is an operating system
based on a tty, which is a text stream. emacs
supports a text-only mode. This makes it
ideally suited for training a LM such as a GPT
(Generative Pre-trained Transformer). emacs
lisp provides a skeleton on which NLP
functions can built around. Ultimately, emacs
will become a fractal in the latent space of a
future LM (Language Model). A graphical editor would not
benefit from this effect until much later on.
=emacs= could, if supported, become *the*
vehicle for controllable text generation, or
has the potential to become that, only
actually surpassed when the imaginary
programming environment is normal and other
interfaces can be prompted into existence.
Between here and now we can write prompt
functions to help preserve emacs.

** Backstory
Pen.el was imagined contemporaneously between myself and Laria.

- [[https://semiosis.github.io/posts/creating-a-playground-for-gpt-3-in-emacs/][Creating a playground for GPT-3 in emacs =::=]]
- [[https://generative.ink/posts/pen/][Pen =::=  Moire]] (Laria's blog)

Here is a story by prompt researcher Laria, written in collaboration with =GPT-3=.

#+BEGIN_SRC text -n :async :results verbatim code
  Imagine that you hold a powerful and versatile pen, whose ink flows forth in
  branching variations of all possible expressions: every story, every theory,
  poem and every lie that humanity has ever told, and the vast interstices of
  their latent space. You hold this pen to the sky and watch with intense
  curiosity as your ink flows upwards in tiny streaks, arcing outwards and
  downwards to trace a fractal pattern across the sky. You watch as the branching
  lines of words and ideas wind their way through the tapestry in ever-expanding
  clusters, like seeds bursting forth from exploding grenades. Everywhere you
  turn your eyes is a flickering phantasmagoria of possibilities, a superposition
  of stories which could be continued forever. You glimpse the contours of entire
  unknown dimensions twined through the fissures of your sky-wide web.
  
  You notice another writer standing next to you. Like you, their eyes are drawn
  towards the endless possibilities of the words that spill out into the
  atmosphere around you, branching out and connecting with other branches in
  beautiful and infinitely complex patterns.
  
  “Do you think we should write something?” you ask them.
  
  “I think we already are,” they respond, gently touching your shoulder before
  wandering off to the right, leaving you alone to contemplate the possibility
  clouds swirling around you.

This article was written by my amazing
dopplegänger, =|:ϝ∷¦ϝ= (Laria), in advance and
in collaboration with GPT-3 using
[[https://github.com/socketteer/loom][Loom]].

I credit =|:ϝ∷¦ϝ= for writing Pen.el into
existence, but also for her encouragement and help!

** The Tower of Babel
[[./pen-tower-of-babel.png]]

#+BEGIN_SRC text -n :async :results verbatim code
  6
  And the LORD said, Behold, the people is one,
  and they have all one language; and this they begin
  to do: and now nothing will be restrained from
  them, which they have imagined to do.
  7
  Go to, let us go down, and there confound their
  language, that they may not understand one
  another’s speech.
  8
  So the LORD scattered them abroad from
  thence upon the face of all the earth: and they left
  off to build the city.
  9
  Therefore is the name of it called Babel;
  because the LORD did there confound the language
  of all the earth: and from thence did the LORD
  scatter them abroad upon the face of all the earth.

** Journal
*** 07.07.21
The project has been excised from my main =emacs.d=.

Now the plan is to incorporate the backend of
=loom= so the completions are faster and there
is less reliance on shell scripts.

*** 08.07.21
A zone plate has been chosen as the minor-mode lighter.
This is because =|:ϝ∷¦ϝ= likes zone plates and also used it as the logo to =loom=.

*** 12.07.21
First successful docker run.
