#+TITLE: davinci-instruct-beta in emacs and Pen.el
#+DATE: <2021-07-18>
#+AUTHOR: Shane Mulligan
#+KEYWORDS: gpt pen nlg

** Summary
I demonstrate the default behaviours of a
=.prompt= engineered in =Pen.el= to do
generation and insertion.

=davinci-instruct-beta= is a fine-tuned
variant of =GPT-3= designed to generate text
given an NLP task.

** Prompt
A generic generation task.

Here, =max-tokens: <2>= specifies that the 2nd
parameter of the prompt function substitute
into the relevant template placeholder in the
=max-tokens= parameter.

This is the first time a variable has been
used to supply a prompt hyperparameter, rather
than part of the prompt.

** Generated blog post about emacs

#+BEGIN_SRC text -n :async :results verbatim code
  Emacs, Emacs, Emacs. Life without emacs is unimaginable for me.
  
  I've been using emacs for more than 10 years now. I can't remember when I first installed it on my computer. I know it was about 10 years ago and I was just a simple student.
  
  When I first installed it, I didn't have a clue what it was. I actually didn't have any idea that it was an editor. I just knew that it was some software that I had to install.
  
  Fast forward 10 years and I now know that it is indeed an editor. But it is so much more than that.
  
  It is one of the most powerful editors and development environments out there. I use it every day for my work. I use it to edit code, to debug code, to read documents, to write documents.
  
  It's not very intuitive to use at first. But with time, with experience, it will become second nature.
  
  I would like to mention some of its most useful features.
  
  One of emacs most coveted features is its extensibility. It has more than 2,000 packages that extend its capabilities.
  
  For example, I use it for all my LaTeX work. I don't have to install LaTex separately and worry about installing the wrong version. All I have to do is load a single package and my LaTeX work is done.
  
  It also has its own programming language that it can be programmed in. There are more than 2,000 packages for it as well.
  
  I use emacs for programming too. I can use emacs while programming.
  
  And I actually use it for everything. I use it for reading books, for editing images, for uploading documents.
  
  It's like a swiss army knife. It can do it all.
  
  I use it for everything. It's like a swiss army knife: it can do it all.
