#+TITLE: Create external prompt commands with Pen.el, interactively
#+DATE: <2021-10-16>
#+AUTHOR: Shane Mulligan
#+KEYWORDS: pen codex gpt

** Summary
While interactively using =Pen.el=, commands
are recorded to be run later as standalone
applications.

  We are using listOf 10 to create 10 lists of
  10 items each.
  
  We are using pickUpLine to pick up a random
  line from a list of lines.
  
  We are using decodeResultsList to convert the
  list of strings to a list of Maybe strings.
  
  We are using fromMaybe to convert the list of
  Maybe strings to a list of strings.
  
  We are using unlines to convert the list of
  strings to a single string.
  
  We are using print to print the string.

  This is a list data type.
  
  "Nil" is the empty list, and "Cons" is a
  function that takes an element of type a and a
  list of type a and produces a new list of type
  a.
#+END_SRC

The function is automatically recorded after
performing some interactive editing in
=Pen.el=.

The underlying editing functions are recorded
as standalone functions which you can use with
different parameters, or to extract the json
results.

This is a list data type.

It is recursive.
