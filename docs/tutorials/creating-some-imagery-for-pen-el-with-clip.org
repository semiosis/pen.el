#+TITLE: Imagery for Pen.el with CLIP and inspired from Myst: The Book of Atrus
#+DATE: <2021-07-15>
#+AUTHOR: Shane Mulligan
#+KEYWORDS: gpt clip pen

+ Original source material :: https://generative.ink/posts/alchemical-marriage-gpt-3-x-clip/#you-spin-worlds-together-and-untwine-them

** Summary
I follow the same instructions as in the
aforementioned article to generate some
imagery for =Pen.el=.

+ Project code :: https://github.com/semiosis/pen.el/

+ Tutorial and exhibition :: https://mullikine.github.io/posts/pen-tutorial/

*** Thoughts
Using Pen to generate a programming
environment using a LM. NL is the easiest to
use code for transforming images, programming
languages and NLs. That's why Pen exists, to
be a shell for creativity, provenance and
intelligibility, so as to not get lost in the
interactive fiction.

Don't you want to understand things via code rather than become lost in lost in the interactive fiction?
There's a natural tendency to be amazed at tech like neural image generation, and a tendency to focus on that.
But I think that the best place to focus thought is in the generative process, and in intelligibility.
So though it may not be pretty, the NL shell and the prompt sharing etc. is essentially creating the 'linking books' that Gehn was referring to in Myst.
You have to make the linking books. It's the first rule.
Otherwise u get stuck inside another world unable to escape.
Great allegory there.

*** Docker install =pen.el=

#+BEGIN_SRC sh -n :sps bash :async :results none
  docker run --rm -ti --entrypoint= semiosis/pen.el:latest ./run.sh

  # And to update the image
  docker pull semiosis/pen.el:latest
#+END_SRC

** Demo
I extract part of a passage from =Myst: The Book of Atrus=, using GPT-3 and =pen.el=.

** Generating the imagery
*** Generation 1
This is the passage I have decided upon.

#+BEGIN_SRC text -n :async :results verbatim code
  A time-traveling wizard who uses a magic book and pen to create worlds.
#+END_SRC

[[./wizard2.png]]

I like the little magic swirl above the planet on a pedestel.

*** Generation 2

*** Generation 3

*** Generation 4

*** Generation 5

This reminds me of how I imagined Atrus or Gehn

Hypothesis: both people and language models are multiverse generators.

** Excerpt from =Myst: The Book of Atrus=
#+BEGIN_SRC text -n :async :results verbatim code
  "Ink?"

  "Yes ... but not just any ink.

  It has special powers that ordinary ink does
  not possess.

  So, too, with the pages of the book.

  They are made of a special paper, the formula
  for which was kept secret by the Guild."

  "And the pen?" Atrus asked, pointing to it,
  "Is that special, too?"

  Gehn smiled.

  "No.

  The pen is but a pen.

  However, if anyone else tried to do what we
  are about to do- anyone, that is, without D'ni
  blood-then they would fail.

  It would be impossible."

  Turning to face the page, Gehn set the ink pot
  down, then, dipping the metallic rip of the
  quill into it, lifted the pen above the page
  and began to write.

  Slowly a D'ni character-the word "island,"
  Atrus noted-began to form, its intense
  blackness burned almost into the pure white
  surface by the pen.

  Gehn wrote another dozen characters onto the
  page, then lifted the pen and looked to Atrus.

  "Is it done?" Atrus asked, surprised that
  there had not been more.

  He had expected fireworks or the heavens to
  open.

  "Have you made a new Age?"

  Gehn laughed.

  "It exists, yes ... but as yet it is very
  crude.

  It takes a great deal of work to create an
  Age.

  There are special formulas you have to follow,
  precise laws to obey.

  As I said, it is not simply an Art, it is a
  science-the science of precise description."

  He gestured toward the open book.

  "As yet, I have merely sketched out the most
  basic elements of my new world.

  Ahead lies an immense amount of hard work.

  Every aspect of the Age must be described,
  each new element fitted in.

  But that is not all."

  Reaching across, Gehn took another, much
  smaller book from a pile at the side and held
  it out to Atrus.

  "Once the Age is complete, one must always-
  always-make a Linking Book."

  Atrus took the small book and opened it,
  noting at once how few pages were in it.

  All of them were blank.

  "Yes," Gehn continued.

  "Whenever you travel to a newly written Age
  you must always carry a Linking Book with you.

  If you did not, you would be trapped there,
  without any way of traveling back."

  Atrus looked back at his father, wide-eyed.

  "But what's actually in one of these Linking
  Books?"

  Gehn took the book back.

  "Each Linking Book refers to one of the larger
  descriptive books-to one specific book.

  You might say that it contains the essence of
  the larger book- certain phrases and words
  that fuses it to that book and no other.

  But that is not all.

  For a Linking Book to work, it must also
  include an accurate description of the place
  one wishes to link to on that particular Age,
  which is recorded by writing a special D'ni
  symbol, a Garo-hertee.

  Yes, and a Linking Book must be written in the
  Age and location it is meant to link to.

  And so a Linking Book is, in a sense, a
  working substitute for a descriptive book."

  Atrus thought a moment, then.

  "And can there be only one Linking Book for
  each descriptive book?"

  "Not at all," Gehn answered, delighted by his
  son's understanding.

  Then, setting the slender book back on the
  pile, he added.

  "You can make as many Linking Books as you
  want.

  But you must always make at least one.

  That is the first rule.

  One you must not forget."

  Atrus nodded, then.

  "But what if you change the Age?

  What if you decide to write more in the
  descriptive book?

  Would the Linking Book cease to work?"

  "No.

  If the descriptive book is changed, then all
  Linking Books associated with it will link to
  the changed world."

  Atruss eyes lit, imagining it, only now
  realizing just how complex and powerful this
  Writing was.

  "It sounds . .. astonishing!"
