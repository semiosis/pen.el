#+TITLE: Codex for anything: Imaginary + Real (with a bit of Codex) = Complex
#+DATE: <2021-08-25>
#+AUTHOR: Shane Mulligan
#+KEYWORDS: codex gpt openai pen imaginary-programming ii imaginary

** Summary
tltr; I add an imaginary dimension to the emacs terminal using OpenAI-Codex.

Integrating real interpreters with imaginary
ones creates something new that is greater than
the sum of their parts; A /complex terminal/.

The complex terminal utilises the Codex LM to
perform its underlying prompt functions. A
complex terminal uses imaginary functions to
enable the user to see what may happen upon
running a command, to see what may follow
after writing some code, and see what people
usually do within a terminal context, no
matter how deeply nested within interpreters
or files.

Much more of this to come. I am trying to make
this as robust as possible and it's too exciting.

** Demos
*** Using Codex with vim and nano
- First start emacs
- Then start the emacs terminal
- As you can see I am autocompleting for vim, using emacs
- Likewise you will see I can do the same for nano
- Nano is still pretty hard to use haha
- I could design as many prompt functions as I like for vim using this method
- As you can see I could use context menus and create definitions for vim-related things
- What else can I do?
- Well, while browsing syslogs, I can generate commands to match things, for example
- I could also rely on the autocompletion for EX from within vim

*** What do people typically do in =/var/log=?
- I demonstrated showing what people would probably do in a given context.
- I demonstrated using the glossary system to
  find out what a linux utility/log for a linux utility does.

*** Switching from bash to python
- I will demonstrate using the same imaginary
  functions from one interpreter to the next.
- It's also interesting that upon switching to
  a different interpreter such as python, Codex
  will suggest relevant Python libraries for the
  directory, so long as you listed out the
  contents or made it apparent.

*** Switching from bash to vim and using Codex inside vim
- It appears that codex runs commands from the EX REPL.

Use =pen-complete-lines= to look ahead while
using an interpreter such as ptpython to see
what would follow if you were to run the current line.

I have bound it to =M-4=.

           (pen-lines-complete
            (pen-complete-function preceding-text))))

+ Simple vs complex :: https://youtu.be/SxdOUGdseq4?t=190

[[./imaginary-real-simple.png]]

The etymology of complex means multiple braids.

[[./imaginary-real-complex.png]]

A /complex terminal/ has braided imaginary
programming with real programming. The word
/complex/ is suitable because it describes
this braiding along with the mathematical
connotations of complex numbers.

We could further extend this terminology to
include /complex programming/ in the realm of
/imaginary programming/ to describe a
programming style that combines both real
programming with imaginary programming.

But that is the topic of another blog article.

*** OK, what about automating emacs with Codex?
- I can't generate the emacs chrome from =emacs -nw -Q=, at least from an initial attempt
- Well, I just did "Hello World". What's next?
