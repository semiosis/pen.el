** Summary
I make a solidity code explainer.

** Example
*** Contract

#+BEGIN_SRC text -n :async :results verbatim code
  // SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
  pragma solidity >= 0.4.22 < 0.8.5;
  
  contract Migrations {
    address public owner = msg.sender;
    uint public last_completed_migration[<0;29;7M;
  
    modifier restricted() {
      require(msg.sender == owner,

*** Explanation
#+BEGIN_SRC text -n :async :results verbatim code
  We declare a new contract called Migrations.
  
  This contract will be an abstract contract
  that we'll use to store the version number of
  our smart contracts.
  
  We'll use this contract to keep track of which
  version of our smart contracts we've deployed
  to the blockchain.
  
  We declare a state variable called
  last_completed_migration that will store the
  version number of the smart contract that
  we've deployed to the blockchain.
  
  We also declare a modifier that will restrict
  access to the setCompleted function to the
  owner of the contract.
  
  This is a way to prevent other people from
  modifying the state variable.
  
  We create a function called setCompleted that
  will set the value of the state variable
  last_completed_migration to the value passed
  in as an argument.
  
  We restrict access to this function by using
  the modifier restricted.

      <delim>Code example 1
      pragma solidity 0.4.2;
      
      contract Election {
          // Read/write candidate
          string public candidate;
      
          // Constructor
          function Election () public {
              candidate = "Candidate 1";

      }
      <delim>
  
      <delim>Explanation of 1
      Let me explain the above code. We start by declaring the solidity version with the pragma solidity statement. Next, we declare the smart contract with the "contract" keyword, followed by the contract name. Next, we declare a state variable that will store the value of the candidate name. State variables allow us to write data to the blockchain. We have declared that this variable will be a string, and we have set its visibility to public.  Because it is public, solidity will give us a getter function for free that will allow us to access this value outside of our contract. We'll see that in action later in the console!
      
      Then, we create a constructor function that will get called whenever we deploy the smart contract to the blockchain. This is where we'll set the value of the candidate state variable that will get stored to the blockchain upon migration. Notice that the constructor function has the same name as the smart contract. This is how Solidity knows that the function is a constructor.

*** Explanations

1
#+BEGIN_SRC text -n :async :results verbatim code
  We start by importing the Context contract
  from the utils folder.
  
  This contract will give us access to the
  _msgSender() function, which will return the
  address of the account that called the
  function.
  
  We then declare the abstract contract Ownable,
  which will allow us to use the access
  modifiers onlyOwner.
  
  The constructor function is where we set the
  owner of the contract to the account that
  deployed it.
  
  This is done by calling the
  _transferOwnership() function, which is an
  internal function that will change the owner
  of the contract.
  
  The onlyOwner modifier will make sure that
  only the owner of the contract can call the
  function.
  
  The renounceOwnership function will make the
  contract ownerless.
  
  The transferOwnership function will change the
  owner of the contract to a new account.
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_SRC text -n :async :results verbatim code
  We start by importing the Context smart
  contract.
  
  This is a library that we'll use to make sure
  that the owner of the contract is the one who
  is calling it.
  
  We can do this by using the _msgSender()
  function.
  
  Next, we declare the contract as an abstract
  contract.
  
  This means that it will be an abstract class
  that cannot be instantiated.
  
  We do this with the "abstract" keyword.
  
  Then, we declare the constructor function.
  
  This is the only function that will be called
  when the contract is instantiated.
  
  We use the constructor keyword to declare it.
  
  Next, we declare the owner state variable.
  
  This is the only state variable that will be
  stored on the blockchain.
  
  It will store the address of the owner of the
  contract.
  
  Then, we declare the event that will be called
  when the owner is changed.
  
  This is a function that is called when an
  event is emitted.
  
  Finally, we declare the onlyOwner modifier.
  
  This is a modifier that is used to restrict
  the use of the function to the owner of the
  contract.

  We start by importing the Context smart
  contract.
  
  This is a library of code that we'll be using
  in our own smart contract.
  
  We'll be using it to restrict access to the
  contract to only the owner.
  
  Next, we declare the abstract contract that
  we'll be inheriting from.
  
  This is a contract that we'll be using as a
  base for our own smart contract.
  
  We'll be using it to restrict access to the
  contract to only the owner.
  
  The constructor function is where we'll set
  the owner of the contract.
  
  We'll be using the _transferOwnership function
  to set the owner of the contract.
  
  This function is an internal function that is
  used by the contract to change the owner of
  the contract.
  
  We'll see how to use it later in the console.
  
  The onlyOwner modifier is a modifier that
  restricts access to the function to only the
  owner of the contract.
  
  We'll use this modifier in our functions to
  restrict access to the contract to only the
  owner.
  
  The renounceOwnership function is used to
  remove the owner of the contract.
  
  It can only be called by the owner of the
  contract.

  change the owner of the contract.

  This is the same code as the first example,
  except that it is abstract.
  
  This means that it will not be directly
  deployed to the blockchain.
  
  Instead, it will be used as a base class to
  create a new smart contract.
  
  This is useful for creating contracts that are
  based on a common base contract.
  
  We start by declaring the solidity version
  with the pragma solidity statement.
  
  Next, we declare the smart contract with the
  "contract" keyword, followed by the contract
  name.
  
  Next, we declare a state variable that will
  store the value of the candidate name.
  
  State variables allow us to write data to the
  blockchain.
  
  We have declared that this variable will be a
  string, and we have set its visibility to
  public.
  
  Because it is public, solidity will give us a
  getter function for free that will allow us to
  access this value outside of our contract.
  
  We'll see that in action later in the console!
  Then, we create a constructor function that
  will get called whenever we deploy the smart
  contract to the blockchain.
  
  This is where we'll set the value of the
  candidate state variable that will get stored
  to the blockchain upon migration.
  
  Notice that the constructor function has the
  same name as the smart contract.
  
  This is how Solidity knows that the function
  is a constructor.
  
  We also declare an event called
  OwnershipTransferred.
  
  This event will be emitted whenever ownership
  of the contract changes.
  
  This is useful for tracking changes in
  ownership.
  
  Next, we declare a modifier that will restrict
  access to the contract's functions.
  
  This modifier is called onlyOwner.
  
  It will make sure that only the owner of the
  contract can call the function.
  
  Finally, we declare a function called owner.
  
  This function will return the address of the
  owner of the contract.
  
  Then, we declare a function called onlyOwner.
  
  This function will throw an exception if it is
  called by anyone other than the owner of the
  contract.
  
  Next, we declare a function called
  renounceOwnership.
  
  This function will leave the contract without
  an owner.
  
  It will not be possible to call onlyOwner
  functions anymore.
  
  Can only be called by the current owner.
  
  Finally, we declare a function called
  transferOwnership.
  
  This function will transfer the ownership of
  the contract to a new account.
  
  Can only be called by the current owner.

  We start by declaring the solidity version
  with the pragma solidity statement.
  
  Next, we import the Context contract, which is
  a smart contract that we'll use to store the
  owner of the contract.
  
  This is a good practice to follow, as it will
  make it easier to migrate to newer versions of
  solidity.
  
  Then, we declare the abstract Ownable
  contract, which is a smart contract that we'll
  use to restrict access to functions.
  
  It will also give us a constructor function,
  which will allow us to set the owner of the
  contract.
  
  The constructor function will set the owner of
  the contract to the address of the account
  that deploys the contract.
  
  The onlyOwner modifier will restrict the
  access to the function to the owner of the
  contract.
  
  The renounceOwnership function will make the
  contract ownerless.
  
  The transferOwnership function will transfer
  the ownership of the contract to a new
  account.
