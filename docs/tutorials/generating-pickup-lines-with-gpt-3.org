** Summary
I create a prompt in my prompt description
format and use it to generate some pickup

** Further exploration
I wonder if I put the temperature down to 0 if
the pickup lines would all come out autistic.
and if I raised it to 1, the pickup lines
would be super random -- you know crazy girls
might like that.

** Version 2
*** Techniques to making a better prompt
- Use query reformulation (pick the best ones and feed back in to improve the prompt)
- Use a generic completer to more rapidly redesign the prompt
- I label each generated pick up line so the new generations are more specific when leaving a label out that I want to avoid
