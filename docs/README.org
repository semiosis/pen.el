* Pen project timeline
+ Stage 1 - This is a dockerized =pen.el= that makes use of both GPT-3 and GPT-j.
  + Implementation [2/4]
    - [X] emacs-lisp functions are generated from YAML =.prompt= files
    - [X] Use built-in elisp functions for portability
    - [ ] Select backend interface in emacs
      - [ ] Shell interface to OpenAI to python
      - [ ] GPT-j interface
        - [[./gpt-j.org]]
    - [ ] Dockerize Pen
      - https://github.com/semiosis/pen-docker/
+ Stage 2 - This is a collaborative =pen.el= with an exploration tool like loom (https://github.com/socketteer/loom)
  - [ ] Generations stored in Datomic
    - https://semiosis.github.io/posts/representing-multiverses-with-datomic/
  - [ ] Prompts stored in Datomic
  - [ ] Prompt Catalogue
    - http://github.com/semiosis/pen.el/blob/master/pen-prompt-tablist.el
  - [ ] Make use of arbitrarily many git repositories that store prompts
    - Load a repository such as this: https://github.com/semiosis/prompts
+ Stage 3
  - [ ] Incorporate OpenAI's Codex model, which should be available at this stage.
  - [ ] vim
    - https://github.com/semiosis/pen.vim
  - [ ] Standalone application based in emacs, available through a web browser

** Design
+ Completed [ ]
  - [X] Default behaviour of generated functions
    - [X] First argument may be selection
    - [ ]If selection then text is replaced by default
  - [X] Prompt Catalogue tablist prototype
    - http://github.com/semiosis/pen.el/blob/master/pen-prompt-tablist.el
  - [X] Generate functions of composed prompts
  - [ ] Generate prompts from interactive keyboard macros
  - [ ] Prompt development workflow
  - [ ] Prompt catalogue tablist
  - [ ] Search workflow
    - Semantic search for =straight.el=
    - Semantic search for =nixos.el=
    - Semantic concordance for =KJV bible=
