I had this one idea for a video-game design today, but there's something about software abstraction which makes me uncomfortable.
It's that after coming up with the abstraction in my head, it becomes very easy to imagine its
application to AI fiction, which I think is an abomination.

I rebuke AI fiction and I choose instead to allow my mind to conform to the mind of Christ, or to listen to the mind of Christ.

Therefore, I think it's a good idea to build thinking tools for facilitating people in doing the will of God.

This is indeed challenging.
