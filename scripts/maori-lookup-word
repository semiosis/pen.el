# There is a problem with this dictionary though, because it includes anti-gender stuff, for example.
# But there are also other problems. I don't want to link to a marori dictionary.
# Rather, I want to be able to translate into english words, and then get the definitions from a different dictionary!
# Because the originar meanings of the words must be preserved, and we're not translating Maori or anti-gender ideologies into bible-language.
# I need to translate the original meanings of the words into Maori.
# The dictionaries I use must be taken from official resources such as:
# https://www.swordsearcher.com/index.html?source=adwords&campaign=swordsearcher-search&adgroup=swordsearcher&adnum=005
# Therefore, what I need is
# maori-lookup-word wahine
