;; Iteration macro
;; ---------------
;; We intended this macro to present an abstraction of iteration through a sequence
;; where each element of seq is bound to the identifier elem-name inside of
;; computation. However, our implementation of this macro fails to present this
;; abstraction: instead, it exposes its implementation to clients.
