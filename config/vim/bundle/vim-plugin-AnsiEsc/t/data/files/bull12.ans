                        WILDNET NETWORK RULES
                        ---------------------

[ ACCESS TO MESSAGES ]

UNRESTRICTED Conferences:  Most Wildnet conferences are
      unrestricted forums where ALL messages are accessible to
      all members of the network, subject to the discretion of
      local sysops and network administration.

      There are no facilities for private or secure messages in
      unrestricted conferences and all messages no matter how
      marked, are open to all members of the network.

RESTRICTED Conferences:  Some Wildnet conferences are restricted
      forums; they include a few network admin and age
      restricted conferences.  Access to these conferences is
      limited to BBS callers and member Sysops who meet the
      requirements listed in network documentation.  Members who
      meet the requirements will be allowed access to all
      messages in the forum subject to the discretion of local
      sysop(s) and network administration.

      In accordance with the Electronic Communications Privacy
      Act of 1986, it is unlawful for a person who is not a
      member of the Wildnet network and/or does not meet the
      requirements for access to a restricted conference to
      intentionally intercept or use any messages or message
      portions from a restricted conference.  It is also
      unlawful for any person authorized access to a restricted
      Wildnet conference to intentionally disclose messages or
      message portions from restricted conferences to any other
      person who is not authorized access to that conference.

      There are no facilities for private or secure messages in
      restricted conferences and all messages no matter how
      marked are open to all network members with authorized
      access.

[ CONFERENCE RULES ]

      Each conference has a moderator/host who will post the special
guidelines for that conference if needed.  Please co-operate with the
conference moderator; He or she is in charge of the conference.
There is more information located in NODES.DOC, under the heading
of "Problem Resolution".  Please refer there for greater detail.

[ ALIASES ]

      Aliases are only allowed in conferences that are marked "ALIAS
ALLOWED" in the conference listings.  All other conferences require the
use of REAL NAMES ONLY.  Real names are allowed in the alias
conferences, but aliases are not allowed in the real name conferences.
Sysops: Please make sure your Wildnet conferences are configured
correctly.

[ QUOTING OF MESSAGES ]

      When replying to a message, please don't quote the entire
message; We've all read the same messages and don't wish to read them
again.  You should usually quote a couple lines to refresh people's
memory, but keep the quotes to 15 lines or less, unless there are
several questions/points that you wish to reply to.  Taglines should
normally not be quoted.  Moving mail costs everyone money.  Cutting
down on overquoting will greatly reduce everyone's phone bill.

[ TAGLINES ]

        In order to promote cost savings, we feel that 3 lines should
suffice for the length of a tagline. Use of ANSI in taglines may be
restricted in some conferences. Common courtesy is asked of all to
refrain from exceeding this limit on a regular basis.

[ TOPICS ]

      Please keep your messages on the topic of the conference.  If
off-topic or out-of-place messages occur, please let the moderator take
care of it.  If the moderator is unavailable (vacation, illness, etc.),
please let your Sysop know about the problem. A moderator may declare a 
topic "off topic" if it is warranted in their judgement.

[ FOUL LANGUAGE ]

      Unless you are writing messages in an adult conference  (over
18/21), you must keep your language clean.  Most Wildnet conferences
are open to people of all ages and foul language is inappropriate in
these conferences.

      Don't use text like SH#%, F%#K, or anything similar.  It doesn't
take that much imagination to figure these out.  When in doubt, use the
Billboard principle.  Do not post words in a message that you would not
see on roadside advertisements.

[ ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ]

      For additional information about Wildnet along with a node list,
historical information, node and hub guidelines, please refer to the
