  # Let's say a triple (a, b, c) is a zigzag if
  # either a < b > c or a > b < c.

  # Given an array of integers numbers, your task
  # is to check all the triples of its consecutive
  # elements for being a zigzag.

  # More formally, your task is to construct an
  # array of length numbers.length - 2, where the
  # ith element of the output array equals 1 if
  # the triple (numbers[i], numbers[i + 1], numbers[i + 2]) is a zigzag, and 0 otherwise.
