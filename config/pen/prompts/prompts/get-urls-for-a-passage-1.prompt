task: "Get URLs for a passage"
doc: "Given some text return relevant URLs"
tags: web lookingglass
prompt-version: 4
issues:
  - DONE URLs are sometimes invalid or outdated. Add a validator.
  - The corrector could literally just be a google search for that url
  - It's a little slow because of the validator (checks results for 404).
  - Also, add a URL corrector (syntax checker for urls, with a specific LM)
todo:
  - Generate the URL titles too, so I can select from those
