  This anonymous gold coinage appears to have been initiated shortly before
  Rajaraja Chola invaded Lanka in 990 AD, and struck through the period when
  the Cholas dominated the island (1017-1070), and continued by closely
  similar coins struck for Vijayabahu (1055-1110) after he re-established
  Sinhala independence in 1070. Like other Lankan coins from around the 11th
  Century, no date is indicated.
