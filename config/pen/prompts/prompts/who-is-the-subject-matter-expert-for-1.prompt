    In Abrahamic religions, the Garden of Eden
    (Hebrew: גַּן־עֵדֶן‎ – gan-ʿḖḏen) or Garden of
    God (גַּן־יְהֹוָה‎ – gan-Yhwh), also called
    the Terrestrial Paradise, is the biblical
    paradise described in Genesis 2-3 and Ezekiel
    28 and 31.[1][2] The location of Eden is
    described in the Book of Genesis as the source
    of four tributaries. Among scholars who
    consider it to have been real, there have been
    various suggestions for its location:[3] at
    the head of the Persian Gulf, in southern
    Mesopotamia (now Iraq) where the Tigris and
    Euphrates rivers run into the sea;[4] and in
    Armenia.
