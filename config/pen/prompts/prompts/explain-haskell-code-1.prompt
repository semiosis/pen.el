    <delim>Code example 1
    data Area = Circle Float Float Float
    surface :: Area -> Float
    surface (Circle _ _ r) = pi * r ^ 2
    main = print (surface $ Circle 10 20 10 )
    <delim>

    <delim>Explanation of 1
    We have created a new type called Area. Next, we are using this type to calculate the area of a circle. "surface" is a function that takes Area as an input and produces Float as the output.

    Keep in mind that "data" is a keyword here and all user-defined types in Haskell always start with a capital letter.

    Here is some new code:
