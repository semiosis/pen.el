    Tokens in the Ethereum ecosystem can represent any fungible tradable good:
    coins, loyalty points, gold certificates, IOUs, in-game items, etc. Since
    all tokens implement some basic features in a standard way, this also means
    that your token will be instantly compatible with the Ethereum wallet and
    any other client or contract that uses the same standards.
