  Title: Build a WhatsApp Chatbot With Python, Flask and Twilio
  Summary: A chatbot is a software application that is able to conduct a conversation with a human
  user through written or spoken language. The level of "intelligence" among chatbots varies greatly.
  While some chatbots have a fairly basic understanding of language, others employ
  sophisticated artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) algorithms to achieve an
  almost human conversational level. In this tutorial I'm going to show you how easy it is to build a
  chatbot for WhatsApp using the Twilio API for WhatsApp and the Flask framework for Python.

  Title: Run Your Flask Regularly Scheduled Jobs with Cron
  Summary: A common need of web applications is to have a periodically running task in the
  background. This could be a task that imports new data from third party sources, or maybe one
  that removes revoked tokens from your database once they have expired. In this and many other
  situations you are faced with the challenge of implementing a task that runs in the background at
  regular intervals. This is a pattern that many people ask me about. I've seen implementations that
  are based on the APScheduler package, on Celery, and even homegrown solutions built inside a
  background thread. Sadly none of these options are very good. In this article I'm going to show
  you what I believe is a very robust implementation that is based on the Flask CLI and the cron
  service.
