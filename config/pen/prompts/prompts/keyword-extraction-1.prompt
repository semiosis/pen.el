  GPT-3 showed that language can be used to instruct a large neural network
  to perform a variety of text generation tasks. Image GPT showed that the
  same type of neural network can also be used to generate images with high
  fidelity. We extend these findings to show that manipulating visual
  concepts through language is now within reach.
