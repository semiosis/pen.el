  Men at Work are an Australian rock band formed
  in Melbourne in 1978 and best known for
  breakthrough hits such as "Who Can It Be Now?"
  or "Down Under". Its founding member and
  frontman is Colin Hay, who performs on lead
  vocals and guitar. After playing as an
  acoustic duo with Ron Strykert during 1978â€“79,
  Hay formed the group with Strykert playing
  bass guitar and Jerry Speiser on drums. They
  were soon joined by Greg Ham on flute,
  saxophone, and keyboards and John Rees on bass
  guitar, with Strykert then switching to lead
  guitar.
