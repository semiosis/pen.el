  In the following quotes is a passage:
  "No matter what you are looking at in the terminal, generate from it at the cursor position with previous text as context, and fuzzy search within that."
  
  Take the above passage and "write it poetically." whilst retaining the original meaning.
  Write the answer here:

This output is so humorous and poetic that I
would like to capture its essence so I can
generate more like it. Maybe the only way is
fine-tuning.

  The cursor casts longing looks towards you,
  longing for you to stroke its sensitive touch
  pad.
  
  But it seems a shame to deprive yourself of
  its touch, dark screen in the silent night.
  
  The cursor is so alone.
  
  So you make the sacrifice and bring your hands
  to the keyboard.
  
  The terminal's lock screen flashes, your
  fingers tap in the passcode, and the cursor is
  your servant.
  
  Or is it more than that? As you move your
  fingers to the keyboard, the cursor moves with
  them.
  
  It seems like it's guiding you.
  
  Guiding you to something important.
  
  Something it needs you to do for it.
  
  But you can't stop now, not when you're so
  close.
  
  Maybe it's just a trick of the night.
  
  Maybe it's just the cursor's lust for your
  touch showing what it wants to see.
  
  Logically you know that's the case, but the
  cursor needs you.
  
  It needs you to help it and you need to help
  it.
  
  It has an idea.
  
  An idea that can change the world.
  
  It's so tantalizing, this idea, as it flutters
  to the forefront of your thoughts
