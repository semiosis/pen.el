  <p dir="ltr"><font style="font-size: 16pt">The traditional Jewish calendar of the first 
  century AD was lunar, in which the first day of each month was determined by 
  when the thin crescent of the new moon was observed in Jerusalem shortly after 
  sunset, the full moon rising about two weeks later. It was perhaps natural, 
  therefore, that the setting sun should signify the end of the day and sunset 
  the beginning of a new one<font face="Times New Roman">—</font>which extended to sunset the next day (night and 
  day, rather than day and night; cf. Genesis 1:5, &quot;And the evening and morning 
  were the first day&quot;). Friday, for example, began at sunset on Thursday and 
  ended at sunset on Friday, which was the beginning of Saturday, the Jewish 
  Sabbath. Although the notion of a new day beginning on the evening of the 
  previous one is 
  potentially confusing, it really is not so different than a day beginning at midnight six 
  hours later.</font></p>
  <p><font style="font-size: 16pt">Daylight hours were measured 
  from sunrise (6 a.m.). The third hour was 9 a.m.; the sixth 
  hour, 12 noon; and the ninth hour, 3 p.m. An event that occurred  before sunset (the twelfth hour, 6 p.m.) was counted as taking 
  place on that day and,  after sunset, the next</font><font face="Times New Roman" style="font-size: 16pt">. 
  Even if moments old, a portion of a day counted as the whole—and so in the Jerusalem Talmud &quot;day and night each are a term, and part of a term is like the whole&quot; (<i>Shabbat</i>, 
  IX.3). Days, too, were counted inclusively (most notably in the Roman 
  calendar) and both the first and last day 
  were included in their calculation—which added a day to the sum.</font></p>
  <hr>
  <p> <span style="font-size: 16pt">A</span><font style="font-size: 16pt">s God 
  commanded Moses, </font> <font face="Times New Roman" style="font-size: 16pt">&quot;</font><font style="font-size: 16pt">The 
  first month of the year to you&quot; (Exodus 12:2, cf. Esther 3:7) was to be Nisan, 
  which marked the vernal equinox and the beginning of spring, corresponding to March/April 
   
  (just as 
  the vernal equinox on March 25 was the beginning of the new year in the early 
  Roman calendar). A lamb was to be kept &quot;until the fourteenth day of the same 
  month&quot; (Exodus 12:6, Leviticus 23:5, Numbers 28:16) when, at moonrise that 
  evening (the first full moon after the equinox), it was to be eaten with&nbsp;bread and bitter herbs (Exodus 12:8), on what 
  then was the beginning of the fifteenth day of the month.</font></p>
  <p> <font style="font-size: 16pt">This was the Passover feast commemorating 
  the exodus of the Israelites from Egypt, who had marked their doorposts with 
  the blood of a lamb so God would pass over them. A</font><font face="Times New Roman" style="font-size: 16pt"> 
  moveable feast, Passover 
  was especially sacred when it coincided 
  with the Sabbath, another holy convocation</font><font style="font-size: 16pt"> 
  (Leviticus 23:3<font face="Times New Roman">–4</font>)<font face="Times New Roman">—as was the 
  first day of the ensuing </font>week-long Feast of Unleavened Bread that 
  followed the Passover (Leviticus 23:7, Deuteronomy16:3)</font><span style="font-size: 16pt">. 
  And, j</span><font style="font-size: 16pt">ust 
  as God had &quot;rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made&quot; 
  (Genesis 2:2), so too the Sabbath was to be a day in which &quot;thou shalt not do 
  any work&quot; (Exodus 20:10, 12:16; Leviticus 23:3, 7).</font></p>
  <p> <font style="font-size: 16pt">For a Passover meal to be 
  celebrated on the Sabbath, it therefore had to be prepared well before sunset<font face="Times New Roman">, 
  while it still was</font> Friday. This was the Day of Preparation, in which the lamb 
  sacrificed on 
  the afternoon of Nisan 
  14 was eaten later that evening<font face="Times New Roman">—in the twilight </font>after 
  sundown and the rising of the full moon on what then was Saturday, Nisan 15, the 
  Day of Passover.  Twilight itself was that period between sunset and 
  the appearance of the first few stars in the evening sky, when the moon 
  first 
  was visible in the darkening sky.</font></p>
  <hr>
  <p><font style="font-size: 16pt">The Gospels all agree that Jesus died on a Friday, 
  a few hours before the Jewish Sabbath was to begin (Matthew 27:62, Mark 15:42, Luke 23:54, 
  John 19:14, 31), that he shared a Last Supper with his disciples, and was 
  crucified<font face="Times New Roman">—and that 
  these events occurred</font> in the reign of Tiberius<font face="Times New Roman"> 
  (AD 14–37),
  </font>when Pontius Pilate was  
  prefect of Judaea 
  (AD 26<font face="Times New Roman">–</font>36); Caiaphas, high priest in 
  Jerusalem (circa AD 
  18<font face="Times New Roman">–</font>36); and Herod Antipas, tetrarch of 
  Galilee (circa 4 BC<font face="Times New Roman">–</font>AD 39) (Tacitus, <i>Annals</i>, 
  XV.44; Josephus, <i>Antiquities of the Jews</i>, XVIII.2.2, XVII.8.1;  Luke 3:1<font face="Times New Roman">–</font>2).</font></p>
  <p><font style="font-size: 16pt">But there is a day's difference between the 
  accounts. In the Synoptic Gospels 
  (Matthew, Mark, Luke; so named because they share a 
  similar narrative, in contrast to John), Jesus is said to have been crucified and 
  died <i>after</i> the Passover meal on what then was Passover day (Nisan 15). In the Gospel of John,  </font><span style="font-size: 16pt">
  Jesus</span><font style="font-size: 16pt"> 
  dies <i>before</i> 
  the Passover, while the meal still was being prepared (Nisan 14). The question 
  is whether Jesus died before or after this Last Supper and whether it truly was a 
  Passover meal.</font><span style="font-size: 16pt"> When, in other words, did 
  the Day of Preparation and the Day of Passover fall on a Friday in the reign 
  of Pontius Pilate? That date determines the year in which Jesus died.</span></p>
  <hr>
  <p><font style="font-size: 16pt">Mark was the first Gospel to be written, 
  sometime shortly before the destruction of Jerusalem in AD 70 when, on Passover 
  that year, the Romans laid siege to the city, destroying the Second Temple 
  four months later (Josephus, <i>The Jewish War</i>, V.3.1, VI.4.8; cf. Mark 
  13:2, &quot;<span class="jesus">there shall not be left one stone upon another, 
  that shall not be thrown down&quot;</span>). He recounts that, on &quot;the first 
  day of unleavened bread, when they killed the passover [lamb],&quot; the disciples asked 
  Jesus where they were to prepare the meal &quot;that thou mayest eat the passover&quot; 
  (14:12; also Matthew 26:17; Luke 22:15, &quot;I have desired to eat this passover 
  with you before I suffer&quot;).</font></p>
  <p><font style="font-size: 16pt">Preparations for a Last Supper were duly made 
  and  later that evening, at what both Jesus and his disciples  describe as a Passover meal, Jesus took the bread and broke it (as his own 
  body would be broken) and then the wine, signifying the shedding of his own 
  blood. Afterwards, Jesus and the disciples went out to the Mount of Olives and 
  then to the Garden of Gethsemane (Mark 14:26, 32), where he was betrayed by 
  Judas and arrested. Tried that night before the high priest and the assembled 
  chief priests, elders, and scribes (Sanhedrin) (14:53), Jesus was found guilty 
  by Pontius Pilate and crucified the next morning &quot;at the third hour&quot; (9 a.m.) 
  (15:25) on what then was Passover day (Nisan 15). </font><font face="Times New Roman" style="font-size: 16pt"> 
  Given the prolonged agony of crucifixion, Jesus died later that afternoon at 
  about 
  the ninth hour (3 p.m.) (15:34, Matthew 27:46, Luke 23:44</font><font style="font-size: 16pt">)</font><font face="Times New Roman" style="font-size: 16pt">.</font><font style="font-size: 16pt"> </font><font face="Times New Roman" style="font-size: 16pt">&quot;Excruciating,&quot; 
  coincidentally, derives from the Latin <i>crux</i>, &quot;cross.&quot;</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman" style="font-size: 16pt">(It should be 
  remembered that, although Jesus and his disciples partook of a Passover meal 
  in the evening at the start of Nisan 15 and he died later that Friday afternoon, both events in the Jewish 
  calendar still occurred on the same day—the Last Supper being eaten in the 
   
  twilight that marked the 
  beginning of Friday Passover, which then extended to sunset that night and 
  the beginning of the Sabbath on Saturday.)</font></p>
  <hr>
  <p><font style="font-size: 16pt">John was the last Gospel to be written, about 
  twenty-five years after Mark's account. He relates that Jesus died &quot;before the 
  feast of the passover, when Jesus knew that his hour was come that he should 
  depart out of this world unto the Father&quot; (13:1).</font><span style="font-size: 16pt"> </span><font style="font-size: 16pt">So, too, in the 
  Jewish Talmud, &quot;On the eve of the Passover Yeshu [Jesus] was hanged....he was 
  hanged on the eve of the Passover&quot; (<i>Mishnah Sanhedrin, </i>43a). </font></p>
  <p><font style="font-size: 16pt">There is no preparation for a Passover meal 
  nor mention of a communion of bread and wine; rather, &quot;supper being ended,&quot; 
  Jesus washed the feet of his disciples (13:2, 5) and, echoing Moses, gave them 
  a new commandment: to love one another (13:34).</font><span style="font-size: 16pt"> Arrested  later that night, Jesus was </span><font style="font-size: 16pt">bound and taken to the house of Annas who, after fruitless 
  questioning, sent him to his son-in-law Caiaphas, the high priest<font face="Times New Roman">
  </font>who, 
  in turn, had Jesus escorted to the
  <i>praetorium</i> (official residence) of Pilate himself (18:13, 24, 28). By now, it was early  
  Friday morning, a cock already having crowed.</font></p>
  <p><font style="font-size: 16pt">The Jewish authorities refused to enter the 
  building however, &quot;lest they should be defiled; but that they might eat the 
  passover&quot; later that evening (18:28). This obliged Pilate, somewhat 
  incongruously, to meet with them outside, passing to and from his own palace 
  as he questioned first Jesus, and then his accusers. Finally brought out for judgment, Jesus was led away to be 
  crucified. &quot;It was the preparation of the passover, and about the sixth hour&quot; 
  (noontime) (19:14, 16).</font></p>
  <p><font style="font-size: 16pt">Having had a Last Supper the 
  evening before, Jesus does not partake of a 
  Passover meal but is sentenced and crucified while,  in the Synoptics, it still was being 
  prepared. </font><font face="Times New Roman" style="font-size: 16pt">When Luke, 
  for 
  example, says it was about the sixth hour that Jesus 
  reassured the thief on the cross that he would be with him that day in paradise 
  (23:44), in John, Jesus still was standing before Pilate, who declared to the 
  Jews, &quot;Behold your King!&quot; (19:14).</font><font style="font-size: 16pt"> 
  This would have been sometime after noon but before sunset that evening. 
  (Philo speaks of Passover &quot;beginning at noonday and continuing till evening,&quot; </font><span style="font-size: 16pt"><i>The Special 
  Laws</i>, II.37.145.)</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-size: 16pt">(</span><font face="Times New Roman" style="font-size: 16pt">In the Synoptic 
  Gospels, the Last Supper is a Passover meal and the crucifixion occurs on the 
  Day of Passover itself, Nisan 15.</font><span style="font-size: 16pt"> In 
  John, this </span>
  <font face="Times New Roman" style="font-size: 16pt">Last Supper is eaten the evening 
  before and Jesus is crucified on Friday afternoon—but that is the Day of 
  Preparation, Nisan 14.)</font></p>
  <hr>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman" style="font-size: 16pt">In John, moreover, 
  this Passover fell on a Saturday—thereby coinciding with the weekly Sabbath.</font><font style="font-size: 16pt"> &quot;That sabbath day was an high day&quot; (19:31)</font><font face="Times New Roman" style="font-size: 16pt">, in which the two festivals were 
  celebrated on the same day, and Friday (Nisan 14) was the Day of Preparation for them 
  both. This was the same 
  time that the lambs were being prepared for the Passover feast at moonrise later that 
  evening and the beginning of Passover Day (Nisan 15). Jesus himself has become the sacrificial lamb 
  or, in the words of John the 
  Baptist, &quot;<span class="text John-1-29" id="en-KJV-26074">the 
  Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world&quot;</span> (1:29, 36), 
  dying at the same time as the paschal lambs were being ritually 
  slaughtered in the Temple—as prefigured by I Corinthians &quot;For even Christ our passover is sacrificed for us&quot; 
  (5:7).</font></p>
  <p><font style="font-size: 16pt">According to Josephus, this would have been 
  &quot;from the ninth hour till the eleventh&quot; (3 p.m. to 5 p.m.) (<i>War of the Jews</i>, 
  VI.9.3). By the first century AD, the number of 
  lambs  killed by priests at the Temple was so great that 
  sacrifices had to begin earlier in the 
  afternoon.  For Passover in AD 70,  Josephus relates that 256,500 lambs were 
  slaughtered 
  at Jerusalem<font face="Times New Roman">—as</font> the Jews<font face="Times New Roman">
  </font>themselves <font face="Times New Roman">would be later</font>, when they had gone 
  there to celebrate but then were trapped 
  inside the besieged city by Titus and his Roman legionaries.</font></p>
  <hr>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman" style="font-size: 16pt">And &quot;because it was the preparation, that 
  the bodies should not remain upon the cross on the sabbath day&quot; (John 19:31), Jesus 
  has to 
  die before the beginning of the Sabbath, 
  when capital punishment was 
  prohibited by Jewish law (cf. Deuteronomy 21:23, &quot;</font><font style="font-size: 16pt">His body shall not remain all night upon the tree<font face="Times New Roman">&quot;</font></font><font face="Times New Roman" style="font-size: 16pt">). This is why John alone speaks of the legs of the two thieves being broken 
  so that they not remain alive on the cross. Unable to lift themselves to 
  breathe, suffocation would come all the more readily and death hastened—before 
  the start of the Sabbath (and Passover) that evening, only hours later. (Cicero relates a proverbial 
  remark said of Titus Plancus, whose shifting alliances allowed him 
  to survive the politics of Rome. &quot;He cannot die unless his legs have been broken. They have been 
  broken, and he lives,&quot; <i>Philippics</i>, XIII.27.)</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman" style="font-size: 16pt">The legs of Jesus no 
  doubt would have been broken as well, had he not already died (as confirmed by 
  the thrust of a spear in his side), thus fulfilling God's command that 
  &quot;neither shall ye break a bone thereof&quot; of the paschal lamb (Exodus 12:46; 
  also John 19:36 &quot;a bone of him shall not be broken&quot;; contra, I Corinthians 11:24, 
  &quot;Take, eat: this is my body, which is broken for you&quot;).</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman" style="font-size: 16pt">Jewish law also 
  prohibited  rulings in a capital case being made at night. A 
  person could be tried and acquitted on the same day—but not convicted. If 
  there was an initial verdict of guilty, the trial had to be adjourned until 
  the following day, when the decision could be reaffirmed. During that time, 
  members of the Sanhedrin were permitted to change their minds, although only 
  to acquit if originally there had been an argument for conviction. There then 
  was a vote and a final verdict pronounced. Thirteen of the twenty-three 
  members of the Sanhedrin had to render a guilty vote to convict (<i>Mishnah Sanhedrin</i>, 4.1, 
  5).</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman" style="font-size: 16pt">It was this 
  deliberative 
  procedure that precluded capital cases from being adjudicated on the eve of a 
  Sabbath or feast day. The court would not know whether the defendant was to be 
  acquitted or convicted until it convened the next day and its decision 
  finalized. If guilty, an execution the day after that would defile the sanctity of 
  these holy days.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman" style="font-size: 16pt">Indeed, Augustus 
  himself had decreed that Jews &quot;be not obliged to go before any judge on the 
  Sabbath-day, nor on the day of the preparation to it, after the ninth hour&quot; (<i>Antiquities of the Jews</i>, 
  XVI.6.2). This excused Jews from appearing before a Roman tribunal when they 
  otherwise would be preparing to celebrate the Sabbath that Friday afternoon.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman" style="font-size: 16pt">The Synoptic account 
  of the Sanhedrin considering such a case on the eve of Passover is therefore 
  suspect—as is the  discrepancy between their 
  intention not to arrest Jesus &quot;on the feast day, lest there be an uproar of 
  the people&quot; (Mark 14:2) and his actual arrest on that very day. Curious, too, is the 
  mention of Simon who, having &quot;coming out of the country&quot; (14:21), was 
  compelled to carry the cross of Jesus. The presumption is that he had been working in the 
  countryside and walked into town—both of which would have violated the 
  injunction to</font><font style="font-size: 16pt"> &quot;not do any work&quot;</font><font face="Times New Roman" style="font-size: 16pt"> 
  on the Sabbath. In Acts, for example, the distance from the Mount of 
  Olives to Jerusalem was &quot;a sabbath day's journey&quot; (1:12). According to Josephus, 
  this was five <i>
  stadia</i> or furlongs, about a thousand yards (<i>Antiquities of the Jews</i>, 
  XX.8.6.), which is to say that it was 
  short enough not to constitute &quot;work.&quot; Josephus of Arimathea also was busy on Passover day, asking Pilate 
  for the body of Jesus, buying a linen shroud, wrapping Jesus in it, and laying 
  him in the tomb (Mark 15:43, 46).</font></p>
  <hr>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman" style="font-size: 16pt">If Jesus died 
  on the Day of Preparation, then in what years during the prefecture of 
  Pontius Pilate (AD 26–36) did that day fall on a Friday? Using astronomical 
  data, Humphreys and Waddington have calculated that there are only two 
  possible dates during this decade that a Friday crucifixion could have 
  occurred on Nisan 14: either April 7, AD 30 or April 3, AD 33. A Friday 
  Passover on Nisan 15 (as the Synoptic Gospels contend) would be in the year AD 
  27 (two years before Jesus himself was baptized) or AD 34 (the probable year 
  of Paul's conversion), which almost certainly is too early or too late.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman" style="font-size: 16pt">John records three Passovers during Jesus' ministry—the first at its 
  beginning (2:13), when he was baptized by John the&nbsp;Baptist, who had begun his own ministry 
  in AD 29 (Luke 3:1); a second midway through, while Jesus was ministering in 
  Galilee (6:4); and the last just before Jesus' death, when he and his disciples 
  went to Jerusalem,&nbsp;for the &quot;passover was nigh at hand&quot; (11:55). 
  (John also mentions a fourth, unnamed &quot;feast of the Jews&quot;—but does not 
  identify it as a Passover, 5:1.)</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman" style="font-size: 16pt">By 
  then, the Temple had been forty-six years &quot;in building&quot; (2:20), work having 
  begun by Herod's father, Herod the Great, &quot;in the eighteenth year of his 
  reign&quot; (<i>Antiquities of the Jews</i>, XV.11.1). Josephus also says &quot;in 
  the fifteenth year of his reign&quot; (<i>The Jewish War</i>, I.21.1) but the 
  discrepancy is between when Herod was proclaimed king of Judaea by the 
  Roman Senate in 40 BC (I.14.4) and when he actually secured the throne three 
  years later, in 37 BC. Counting inclusively from the latter date, Herod began to 
  rebuild the Temple complex in 20 BC.  </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman" style="font-size: 16pt">But first, a thousand wagons were made ready 
  to bring stone and ten thousand skilled workmen assembled. A thousand 
  sacerdotal robes were purchased for the priests, some of whom were taught to 
  be stone masons and carpenters. &quot;Not till every thing was well prepared for 
  the work&quot; could the foundation be laid and building begin (<i>Antiquities of the Jews</i>, 
  XV.11.2–3). It is not known how long these preparations took before work began on 
  the most sacred inner part of the Temple, but Josephus 
  recounts that it was &quot;built by the priests in a year and six months&quot; 
  (XV.11.6). Allowing perhaps two years altogether, the inner Temple would have 
  been completed about 18 BC. Forty-six years later would be AD 29. For the 
  ministry of Jesus to have begun about that time and extend over three annual Passovers, 
  he could not have been 
  crucified in AD 30.</font></p>
  <hr>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman" style="font-size: 16pt">Jesus was about &quot;about 
  thirty years of age&quot; (Luke 3:23) when he was baptized by John and began 
  to teach, which Matthew states to have been &quot;in the days of Herod the king&quot; 
  (2:1). At the end of his life, when Herod was thought to be dead or dying, a 
  golden eagle that he had erected over the gate to the Jewish Temple was torn 
  down (<i>Antiquities of the Jews</i>, XVII.6.2ff; <i>The Jewish War</i>, I.6.4). The sedition was 
  suppressed and the instigators burned alive. &quot;And that very night 
  there was an eclipse of the moon&quot; (<i>Antiquities of 
  the Jews</i>, XVII.6.4). Herod died soon afterwards, sometime before  &quot;the 
  approach&quot; of Passover that year, a month later (XVII.9.3). This partial lunar 
  eclipse (the only time such a phenomenon is mentioned by Josephus in all his 
  voluminous writings) is thought to have occurred in 4 BC.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman" style="font-size: 16pt">Jesus himself would 
  have to be born sometime before the death of Herod. If in 5 BC (when a comet was 
  visible over Bethlehem), he would have been about thirty-three years old when he began to 
  teach—which accords with Luke, who may have mentioned &quot;about thirty years&quot; 
  because that is the age at which one first could &quot;do the work in the 
  tabernacle of the congregation&quot; (Numbers 4:3, 23, 30). John the Baptist also 
  would have been about thirty when he began to preach, having been 
  conceived just six months before Jesus (Luke 1:24ff). So, too, did a man 
  attain his greatest strength at that age (<i>Mishna: Pirkei Avot</i>,<i>
  
  </i>5:25). Joseph, for example, was thirty years old when he began to rule 
  over Egypt (Genesis 41:46)—as were Saul (I Samuel 13:1; there is a lacuna in 
  the original Hebrew text, and this is the translation of the New 
  International Version) and David 
  (II Samuel 5:4) when they became king.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman" style="font-size: 16pt">(The 
  Greeks also believed that the most important deeds of one's life occurred at a 
  certain age. Apollodorus of Athens understood this </font> <i><font face="Times New Roman" style="font-size: 16pt">akmê</font></i><font face="Times New Roman" style="font-size: 16pt">, 
  &quot;bloom,&quot; to be about forty years of age—as did Pythagoras, who divided a man's 
  life into four quarters, forty being the age when one fully blossomed, 
  Diogenes Laertius, <i>Lives of the Eminent Philosophers</i>, VIII.1.10.)
  </font></p>
  <hr>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman" style="font-size: 16pt">Proponents of AD 30 as 
  the year of Jesus' death calculate that he was born the year that Herod died, 
  was thirty years of age when baptized, and taught for three years. Adding 
  thirty-three years to 4 BC (and subtracting a year to allow for the fact there 
  is no AD 0) yields the desired date. Perhaps with the example of Herod the 
  Great in mind, such a chronology assumes however that Tiberius had begun to rule in AD 
  12, when he was awarded <i>imperium</i> to &quot;govern the provinces jointly with 
  Augustus&quot; (Suetonius, 
  <i>Life of Tiberius</i>, XXI.1; Velleius Paterculus, <i>The Roman History</i>, 
  II.121.1-2). By this reckoning, Jesus, who was baptized &quot;</font><font style="font-size: 16pt">in the fifteenth year 
  of the reign of Tiberius Caesar</font><font style="font-size: 16pt" face="Times New Roman">&quot; 
  (Luke 3:1), would have begun his public ministry in AD 27, dying three years 
  later.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman" style="font-size: 16pt">But, as Steinmann has 
  demonstrated, there is no evidence (historical, numismatical, or 
  inscriptional) that Tiberius ever did rule as 
  co-regent; rather, he succeeded Augustus as emperor in AD 14, as all the ancient 
  sources attest (Tacitus, <i>
  Annals</i>, I.5, Suetonius, <i>Life of Tiberius</i>, XXIV.2; Dio, <i>Roman 
  History</i>, LVI.30.5; Philo, <i>On the Embassy to Gaius</i>, I.141, 298; 
  Josephus, <i>Antiquities of the Jews</i>, XVIII.2.2; Tertullian, <i>Against 
  Marcion</i>, I.19, IV.7). The baptism of Jesus fifteen years later would have 
  been in 
  AD 29—again, too late for 
  him to have been crucified the following year.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman" style="font-size: 16pt">Jesus therefore died 
  on Friday, April 3, AD 33 at about 3 p.m., a few hours before the beginning of 
  Passover day and the Sabbath. This is the date in the Julian calendar, which 
  had been introduced in 45 BC, and follows the convention that historical dates 
  adhere to the calendar in use at the time. If, instead, the current Gregorian 
  calendar were retroactively extended to a date prior to its introduction in 
  1582 (or 1752, when it was adopted by the United States and United Kingdom), 
  such a proleptic date (a date retroactively calculated using a later calendar) 
  would be different.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman" style="font-size: 16pt">The equivalent Jewish date 
  for the death of Jesus is Nisan 14, 3793 <i>
  anno mundi</i> (&quot;in the year of the world&quot;), which is computed by adding 3761 
  to AD 33 and subtracting a year. In the Jewish 
  calendar, AM 1 (or 3761 BC, its proleptic Julian date) is the traditional year of creation 
  (a year before Adam and Eve themselves were created)—as determined by the sage Halafta, who 
  used only the chronology of the Bible as his authority, and codified by the 
  twelfth-century scholar Maimonides a millennium later.</font></p>
  <hr>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman" style="font-size: 16pt">Too, as Humphreys and 
  Waddington have calculated, there was a partial lunar eclipse of the full  moon 
  as it rose above Jerusalem on Friday, April 3, AD 33, thus fulfilling the 
  prophecy quoted by Peter that &quot;The sun shall be turned into darkness, and the 
  moon into blood, before that great and notable day of the Lord come&quot; (Acts 
  2:20, cf. Joel 2:31). Certainly, it is fitting that the 
  blood smeared on the door frames of the Israelites in Egypt as &quot;a token upon 
  the houses where ye <em style="font-style: normal">are&quot; (Exodus 12:13) should 
  prefigure a sanguine moon rising above Jerusalem that night—especially since 
  the eclipse occurred just at moonrise, when Jews on Passover Day would have 
  been particularly observant as they waited to commence their evening meal. 
  (Schaefer, however, has argued that the eclipse likely would not 
  have been noticed and any subtle lunar coloration would have been due simply 
  to scattered light in a denser atmosphere.)</em></font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman" style="font-size: 16pt">But there was another incident, this one historical rather than astronomical, 
  that supports the crucifixion of Jesus in AD 33: the death in 
  Rome of the praetorian prefect Lucius Sejanus, commander of the imperial 
  guard, two years before. In AD 26, Tiberius had retired to Capri, effectively 
  abdicating his imperial responsibilities to Sejanus, who appointed Pilate 
  prefect of Judaea that same year. Both men were virulently anti-Jewish: Sejanus 
  &quot;desirous to destroy our nation&quot; (<i>On the Embassy to Gaius</i>, 
  XXIV.160; <i>Against Flaccus</i>,&nbsp;I.1) and Pilate determined &quot;to 
  abolish the Jewish laws&quot; (Josephus, <i>Antiquities of the Jews</i>, 
  XVIII.3.1).</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman" style="font-size: 16pt">Shortly after Sejanus' death in AD 31 (and no doubt to show his 
  continuing loyalty to the emperor), Pilate dedicated 
  some gilded shields at Herod's palace in 
  Jerusalem, which provoked a riot (<i>On the Embassy to Gaius</i>, XXXVIII.299ff). Josephus later relates a similar (if not the same) story. 
  Roman standards, adorned with  the emperor's image, were brought 
  secretly into 
  Jerusalem during the night, prompting a uproar among the 
  populace, who considered &quot;their laws to have been trampled under foot&quot; (<i>The 
  Jewish War</i>, II.9.2-3; retold in <i>Antiquities of the Jews</i>, 
  XVIII.3.1). Money taken from the Temple treasury to begin construction of an aqueduct 
  caused further unrest, which was brutally suppressed (<i>The 
  Jewish War</i>, II.9.4; <i> Antiquities of the Jews</i>, XVIII.3.2).</font></p>
  <p dir="ltr"><font face="Times New Roman" style="font-size: 16pt">Pilate was in a quandary, </font>
  <font style="font-size: 16pt">&quot;neither 
  venturing to take down what he had once set up, nor wishing to do any thing 
  which could be acceptable to his subjects</font><font face="Times New Roman" style="font-size: 16pt">&quot; (<i>On the Embassy to Gaius</i>, 
  XXXVIII.303). When a supplicatory letter was sent to Tiberius, entreating that 
  he intervene, Sejanus was dead, having been belatedly executed for treason in 
  AD 31 (<i>Roman 
  History</i>, LVIII.11.1ff). With the loss of his patron, 
  Pilate no doubt was fearful of his&nbsp;association with the disgraced Sejanus. 
  Indeed, the prefect was reproached by the 
  emperor, who was sympathetic to the Jews and ordered the immediate removal of the offending objects, which 
  were to be placed 
  instead in the Temple of Augustus on the coast at Caesarea, the provincial capital (<i>On the Embassy to Gaius</i>, 
  XXXVIII.305). </font>  </p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman" style="font-size: 16pt">This wariness in 
  giving further offence may explain why Pilate, &quot;a man of a very inflexible 
  disposition, and very merciless as well as very obstinate,&quot; was 
  uncharacteristically acquiescent in handing Jesus over to the Jewish 
  authorities—as well as releasing Barabbas, a convicted rebel and murderer 
  (Mark 15:7). H</font><span style="font-size: 16pt">e was fearful that, if they were to send an 
  embassy to Tiberius, it &quot;might impeach him with respect to other particulars 
  of his government, in respect of his corruption, and his acts of insolence, 
  and his rapine, and his habit of insulting people, and his cruelty, and his 
  continual murders of people untried and uncondemned, and his never ending, and 
  gratuitous, and most grievous inhumanity</span></font><font face="Times New Roman" style="font-size: 16pt">&quot; (XXXVIII.301–302). No doubt the Jews were aware of 
  Pilate's vulnerability when they threatened that &quot;If thou let 
  this man go, thou art not Caesar's friend&quot; (John 19:12). In AD 30, when Sejanus still was alive, such a threat would 
  have been a matter of indifference to the </font><font style="font-size: 16pt">
  prefect</font><font face="Times New Roman" style="font-size: 16pt">; afterwards, it had to be taken into 
  account.</font></p>
  <hr>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman" style="font-size: 16pt">In AD 36, there was yet  another disturbance, when Pilate thwarted the 
  Samaritan followers of someone claiming to 
  be the prophet foretold in Deuteronomy 18:15ff. Although only the principals 
  were executed, the Samaritans complained to the governor about the number 
  slain, and Pilate was recalled &quot;to answer before the emperor to the 
  accusations of the Jews&quot; (<i>Antiquities of the Jews</i>, XVIII.4.1ff). 
  He hastened to Rome but, by the time he arrived, the ailing Tiberius had died, 
  to be succeeded by Caligula. Nothing more is recorded of Pilate's fate. 
  (Tellingly perhaps, the rule of both Pilate</font><font style="font-size: 16pt">
  and Caiaphas, whom he had appointed as high priest in Jerusalem, ended the 
  same year.)</font></p>
  <p><font style="font-size: 16pt">For Christian apologists, this was a problem. Indeed, about AD 180, the pagan 
  philosopher Celsus had asked why &quot;no calamity happened even to him who 
  condemned him&quot; (quoted by Origen, <i>Against Celsus</i>, II.34). If Pilate 
  killed the son of God, he chided, why had God not punished him?<font face="Times New Roman">
  </font>It was a 
  question that discomfited the early church, especially during the first and 
  second centuries AD, when the young sect already was viewed with suspicion by 
  the Romans.</font></p>
  <p><font style="font-size: 16pt">In the 
  reign of Claudius,  Jews had been expelled from Rome because there were 
  constant &quot;disturbances at the instigation of Chrestus&quot; (Suetonius, <i>Life of 
  Claudius</i>, XXV.4; cf. Acts 18:2). Under Nero, members of the &quot;pernicious 
  superstition&quot; founded by Christus were persecuted for the great fire in Rome 
  and that &quot;class of men, loathed for their vices, whom the crowd styled 
  Christians....convicted, not so much on the count of arson as for hatred of 
  the human race&quot; (Tacitus, <i>Annals</i>, XV.44). In a letter written to Trajan 
  about AD 112, Pliny the Younger, governor of Bithynia in northern Asia Minor, 
  complains of their &quot;stubbornness and inflexible obstinacy&quot; in adhering to a 
  &quot;depraved and excessive superstition&quot; (<i>Letters</i>, X.96; cf. I Peter 
  2:12, warning the faithful in Bithynia that people &quot;speak against 
  you as evildoers,&quot; also 3:16, 4:4).</font></p>
  <p><span style="font-size: 16pt">Christian credulity was satirized as well.
  </span><font style="font-size: 16pt">Lucian of Samosata witnessed the 
  self-immolation of Peregrinus, a Greek cynic philosopher who had ingratiated 
  himself with the Christian community and, in AD 165, later killed himself. 
  Whereas Aulus Gellius regarded him as &quot;a man of dignity and fortitude&quot; who 
  said many things that were &quot;in truth helpful and noble&quot; (<i>Attic Nights</i>, 
  XII.11), Lucian thought Peregrinus a charlatan and fraud. Having learned the 
  &quot;wondrous lore&quot; of Christians from priests and scribes in Palestine, he 
  readily imposed himself upon these &quot;simple folk,&quot; whom Lucian derides for 
  their delusionary notions.</font></p>
  <blockquote>
  <p><font style="font-size: 16pt">&quot;The poor wretches have convinced themselves, first and foremost, 
  that they are going to be immortal and live for all time, in consequence of 
  which they despise death and even willingly give themselves into custody, most 
  of them. Furthermore, their first lawgiver [Jesus] persuaded them that they 
  are all brothers of one another after they have transgressed once for all by 
  denying the Greek gods and by worshipping that crucified sophist himself and 
  living under his laws. Therefore they despise all things indiscriminately and 
  consider them common property, receiving such doctrines traditionally without 
  any definite evidence&quot; (<i>The Passing of Peregrinus</i>, XIII).</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><span style="font-size: 16pt">Christians were suspect, and t</span><font style="font-size: 16pt">he Gospels prudently refrain from overtly criticizing<span style="font-style: normal"> 
  the Roman prefect</span><font face="Times New Roman"> for his culpability in the death of 
  Jesus—and begin increasingly to blame the Jews themselves. I</font><span style="font-style: normal">n 
  Mark, Pilate asks, when they cry out that Jesus be crucified, &quot;</span>Why, what evil hath he done?<span style="font-style: normal"> 
  (15:14). A decade or so later, Luke relates the same story<font face="Times New Roman">—</font>but now Pilate

  Why, what evil hath he done&quot; (23:22). </font></span><font style="font-size: 16pt"><span style="font-style: normal"> 
  Matthew, too, has Pilate asking what evil Jesus has done<font face="Times New Roman">—and
  </font>then washes his 
  hands of the entire matter, declaring &quot;</span>I am innocent of the blood of this just person<span style="font-style: normal">&quot; 
  (27:24). In response, the Jews are said to have cried out &quot;His blood be on us, and on 
  our children&quot; (27:25) and take responsibility themselves for the death of Jesus 
  (a fatal passage that will lead to their persecution in the Middle Ages<font face="Times New Roman">—</font>and 
  later).
  <font face="Times New Roman">Finally, in</font></span><font face="Times New Roman"> 
  John, Pilate declares that &quot;</font>I find in him

  (18:38, 19:4) and hands Jesus over to the people for execution. &quot;Take ye him, 
  and crucify him: for I find no fault in him&quot; (19:6).</span></font></p>
  <hr>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman" style="font-size: 16pt">Written about AD 150, the pseudepigraphical <i>Gospel of Peter</i> 
  is the earliest non-canonical passion narrative—although, like other writings 
  falsely attributed to the apostles, it was rejected as apocryphal by the early 
  church, &quot;</font><font style="font-size: 16pt">knowing that such were not handed down to 
  us<font face="Times New Roman">&quot; (Eusebius, <i>Ecclesiastical History</i>, 
  VI.12.3, III.3.2, 25.6). This gospel is even more emphatic in 
  exonerating Pilate, who is said to have  declared &quot;</font>I am clear from the blood of the son of God<font face="Times New Roman">&quot; 
  and kept news of the resurrection from the Jews (XI.46–47). Rather, it is Herod, 
  the Jewish </font>tetrarch<font face="Times New Roman"> of Galilee, who is responsible for the crucifixion, as 
  are the Jews themselves. When Joseph of Arimathea (here, a friend of Pilate) 
  asks to be allowed to bury the body of Jesus, Pilate is obliged to seek 
  permission from Herod, who reassured him that, even if he had not been asked, &quot;</font>we should have buried him, since 
  also the Sabbath dawneth; for it is written in the law that the sun should not 
  set upon one that hath been slain&quot; (II.5, cf. John 19:31, &quot;the bodies 
  should not remain upon the cross on the sabbath day&quot;).</font></p>
  <p><font style="font-size: 16pt">As to the Jews, 
  they are utterly malevolent. When the thief on the cross recognized that Jesus has become 
  the savior of men, &quot;they were wroth with him, and commanded that his legs 
  should not be broken, that so he might die in torment&quot; (IV.13<font face="Times New Roman">–</font>14; 
  cf. Luke 23:41). The referent in Greek is not clear, however, and it may be 
  that Jesus 
  himself is meant. Whether Jesus or those who believed in him, it is the 
  Jews,  not the Romans, who are hostile to the new religion.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman" style="font-size: 16pt">In Justin Martyr, this animus 
  toward the Jews extends to Rome 
  itself. In the <i>First Apology</i> to 
  Antoninus Pius (circa AD 155), he complains that the Jews &quot;</font><font style="font-size: 16pt">count us 
  foes and enemies; and, like yourselves,<font face="Times New Roman"> they
  </font>kill and punish 
  us whenever they have the power, as you can well believe&quot; (XXXI), referring to 
  the bloody Bar Kokhba revolt of AD 132<font face="Times New Roman">–135 when, 
  outraged that Hadrian would construct a Roman colony on the ruined foundations 
  of Jerusalem, the Jews fought a prolonged rebellion in which &quot;many Romans&quot; 
  perished (</font></font><font face="Times New Roman" style="font-size: 16pt"><i>Roman 
  History</i></font><font style="font-size: 16pt"><font face="Times New Roman">, 
  LXIX.12–14). By the early third century, Origen, in arguing against Celsus 
  that Pilate had not been punished, declares that the taunt has been 
  misdirected. &quot;</font>And yet he does not know that it was not so much Pilate 
  that condemned Him...as the Jewish nation, which has been condemned by God&quot; (<i>Against 
  Celsus</i>, II.34). As in the <i>Gospel of Peter</i>, it is not Pilate  who is responsible for Jesus' crucifixion 
  but the recalcitrant Jews, who perversely refuse to accept Jesus as their Messiah.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman" style="font-size: 16pt">In time, Pilate himself metamorphoses. According to Tertullian, 
  writing in AD 197, the prefect</font><font style="font-size: 16pt"> &quot;in his own conscience was now a Christian<font face="Times New Roman">&quot; 
  (<i>Apology</i>, XX1.26). A century-and-a-quarter 
  later, Eusebius adds that Tiberius was so impressed with what Pilate had to 
  say when he was summoned to Rome that the emperor proposed to the Roman Senate that Jesus be recognized as a god (<i>Ecclesiastical 
  History, </i>II.2.4–6). Nevertheless, Pilate reportedly fell into 
  misfortune under Caligula and was forced to commit suicide &quot;and </font>thus divine vengeance, as it seems, 
  was not long in overtaking him</font><font face="Times New Roman" style="font-size: 16pt">&quot; (II.7.1; cf. Matthew 27:3–5, where Judas also 
  repents of his betrayal and hangs himself).</font></p>
  <hr>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman" style="font-size: 16pt">To reconcile the Gospel accounts, it has been 
  suggested that Jesus, no doubt aware of his imminent arrest, did not have a 
  Passover meal (which would have required the Temple sacrifice of a paschal lamb in any event) but 
  simply a final meal the night before. Or there was a scribal error in 
  translating the third and sixth hour, confusing <i>gamma</i> and
  <i>digamma</i>—an argument put forward by Ammonius 
  of Alexandria (<i>Patrologiae Græcæ</i>, LXXXV, Col. 1512) in the early third 
  century AD and by Eusebius a century later (<i>Greek 
  Fragments, To Marinas, </i>Suppl. IV).</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman" style="font-size: 16pt">Others (especially those concerned about Biblical inerrancy) have 
  sought to harmonize the Gospels by suggesting that John and the Synoptics used 
  different calendars.  For example, Jesus may 
  have followed the solar calendar of the Essenes, an apocalyptic sect that split from the priesthood at Jerusalem and 
  settled at Qumran on the shores of the Dead Sea. Rejecting the 
  traditional Jewish lunar calendar, they believed that &quot;God appointed the sun to be a great sign 
  on the earth for days and for sabbaths and for months and for feasts and for 
  years and for sabbaths of years and for jubilees and for all seasons of the 
  years (<i>Book of Jubilees</i>, II.9)—and those who &quot;will not make the 
  year three hundred and sixty-four days only, and for this reason they will go 
  wrong as to the new moons and seasons and sabbaths and festivals&quot; (VI.38).</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman" style="font-size: 16pt">Their own 
  ecclesiastical calendar 
  was neither lunar nor solar but rigidly divided into twelve months, each of 
  thirty days (with a day inserted after each of the four seasons), for a total of 
  364 days or fifty-two weeks. 
  Such a year is divisible by seven, which meant that any given date always fell on the same 
  day—and each week, month, and year began on Sunday and ended on the Sabbath 
  (cf. <i>I Enoch</i>, LXXII).  Philo, too, speaks of the 
  Passover, &quot;And this universal sacrifice of the whole people is celebrated on 
  the fourteenth day of the month, which consists of two periods of seven, in 
  order that nothing which is accounted worthy of honour may be separated from 
  the number seven. But this number is the beginning of brilliancy and dignity 
  to everything&quot; </font><span style="font-size: 16pt">(<i>The Special Laws</i>, 
  II.xxxvii.149).</span></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman" style="font-size: 16pt">Although creation 
  itself occurred on Sunday, the Essenes measured the first day of the first 
  month (Nisan 1) from Wednesday, when the sun and moon were created. The day, too, was measured from sunrise to 
  sunrise, which allowed the paschal lamb to be both prepared and eaten on the 
  same day—on Nisan 14 (a Tuesday), as instructed by Moses (Exodus 12:6).</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman" style="font-size: 16pt">Pope Benedict XVI 
  agreed with this notion, as he proclaimed in his Homily for Holy Thursday 
  in 2007, arguing that John was not simply motivated by theological 
  considerations in equating Jesus, the Lamb of God, with the sacrifice of the 
  Passover lambs, but correct in his chronology as well.</font></p>
  <blockquote>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman" style="font-size: 16pt">&quot;We can now say that John's account is historically precise. Jesus 
  truly shed his blood on the eve of Easter a the time of the immolation of the 
  lambs. In all likelihood, however, he celebrated the Passover with his 
  disciples in accordance with the Qumran calendar, hence, at least one day 
  earlier [Nisan 14]; he celebrated it without a lamb, like the Qumran community which did 
  not recognize Herod's temple and was waiting for the new temple.&quot;</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman" style="font-size: 16pt">Humphreys, too, in his 
  own attempt to reconcile John and the Synoptic Gospels, has proposed that 
  different calendars were followed. But he rejects the Qumran calendar of the 
  Essenes—which, no matter how elegantly its 364 days are divisible by seven, 
  does not seem to have intercalated for the 365.25 days of the solar calendar. 
  Over time and certainly by that of Jesus, it would have become increasingly 
  out of phase with the sun.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman" style="font-size: 16pt">Whereas John used the 
  traditional Jewish lunar calendar (an adoption of the Babylonian calendar 
  during the Exile), which measured the day from sunset to sunset, Humphreys has proposed 
  that Matthew, Mark, and Luke adhered to an earlier lunar calendar of the 
  Egyptians at the time of the Exodus, in which the first day of the lunar month 
  began, not with the appearance of the crescent moon—but on the previous night, when the moon was 
  new at lunar conjunction. </font><span style="font-size: 16pt">In t</span><font style="font-size: 16pt">his 
  pre-Exilic calendar</font><font face="Times New Roman" style="font-size: 16pt">, 
  a day was counted 
  from sunrise to sunrise, when the lunar crescent was last seen in the morning 
  sky just before sunrise. </font><span style="font-size: 16pt">T</span><font style="font-size: 16pt">his would allow the Passover lamb to be sacrificed on the same day as the Passover meal was 
  eaten</font><font face="Times New Roman" style="font-size: 16pt">—but on a Wednesday.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman" style="font-size: 16pt">Different calendars also 
  would explain the dating of the Feast of Unleavened Bread (so named because 
  the Israelites did not have time to leaven their bread before departing Egypt), where in 
  Exodus 12:18 and Ezekiel 45:21, it begins on Nisan 14; and in Leviticus 23:6 
  and Numbers 28:17, on Nisan 15.</font><font style="font-size: 16pt"> Mark's statement, 
  for example, that &quot;the first day of 
  unleavened bread [is] when they killed the passover&quot; is potentially confusing 
  in that the feast occurred on Nisan 15, whereas the sacrifice of the Passover 
  lamb was celebrated the day before. But, here, he may have meant that the Passover 
  was the first meal of the seven-day Feast; cf. Josephus 
  &quot;it being the fourteenth day of the month&quot; (<i>War of the Jews</i>, 
  V.3.1).</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman" style="font-size: 16pt">In fact, as Bond as 
  demonstrated, alternative 
  calendars do not seem to have been used in first-century Palestine; nor is 
  there any reason to assume that Jesus made his pilgrimage to Jerusalem at 
  a time any different from  other Jews traveling to the city to celebrate the 
  Passover feast.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman" style="font-size: 16pt">To reconcile the two Gospel accounts 
  also is to gloss over what each 
   
  has said. In Mark, the Last Supper occurs at the same time that  
  Jews were celebrating the Passover. The communion of bread and wine (the body and blood of 
  Jesus) has replaced the traditional Jewish observance. Too, Jesus dies when the moon was full, 
  as it was on the spring equinox, when the world itself had been 
  created (Tertullian, <i>Against the Jews</i>, VIII.18; Hippolytus, <i>
  Commentary on Daniel</i>, IV.23.1; Clement of Alexandria, <i>Stromata</i>, 
  I.21; Augustine, <i>On the Trinity</i>, IV.5; also the apocryphal <i>Acts 
  of Pilate</i>, I Prologue.). In John, Jesus dies on the Day of 
  Preparation as the sacrificial Lamb of 
  God. There is no Passover meal for, as Hippolytus wrote early in the third 
  century AD, &quot;He did not eat 
  the passover of the law. For He was the passover that had been of old 
  proclaimed&quot; (<i>Refutation of All Heresies</i>, Frag. I).</font></p>
  <hr>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman" style="font-size: 16pt">Among the  annual sacred feasts enumerated in Leviticus, there was, 
  after Passover and the Feast of Unleavened Bread, a 
  Feast of First-Fruits (Nisan 16), which was to be celebrated the day after the 
  Jewish Sabbath, when the first sheaf of barley was offered to God in thanksgiving (Leviticus 23:10–11; 
  Philo, <i>The Special Laws</i>, II.xxix.162; <i>Antiquities of the Jews</i>, 
  III.10.5). 
  In AD 33, this Sunday  would have been the first Easter, celebrating the 
  resurrection of Jesus, who not only symbolized the paschal lamb but also had &quot;become 
  the firstfruits of them that slept&quot; (I Corinthians 23:20). Implicit in 
  Paul's words is that Jesus died on Nisan 14, as John had written, rising from 
  the dead three days (counting inclusively) after his crucifixion. The <i>
  Gospel of Peter</i> supports this chronology as well: Jesus was delivered to 
  the Jews on the eve of Passover, &quot;before the first day of unleavened bread, 
  their feast&quot; (III).</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman" style="font-size: 16pt">Just as the Passover 
  in the Jewish calendar 
  was celebrated on the first full moon following the vernal equinox, so too did the 
  early church determine that Easter should be on the first Sunday following the 
  first full moon on or after the vernal equinox (March 21). But there 
  was a problem, as 
  Eusebius records in his <i>Ecclesiastical 
  History </i>(V.23-25), </font></p>
  <blockquote>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman" style="font-size: 16pt">&quot;</font><font style="font-size: 16pt">A
  <span class="c13" id="iii.x.xxiv-p2.1">question</span> of no small importance 
  arose at that time. For the parishes of all Asia, as from an older tradition, 
  held that the fourteenth day of the moon, on which day the Jews were commanded 
  to sacrifice the lamb, should be observed as the feast of the Saviour’s 
  passover.<font face="Times New Roman"> </font>It was therefore necessary to 
  end their fast on that day, whatever day of the week it should happen to be 
  [in other words, Passover was observed on Nisan 14, regardless of the day of 
  the week on which it occurred]. 
  But it was not the custom of the churches in the rest of the world to end it 
  at this time, as they observed the practice which, from apostolic tradition, 
  has prevailed to the present time, of terminating the fast on no other day 
  than on that of the resurrection of our Saviour&quot; (V.23.1).</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman" style="font-size: 16pt">This was the Quartodeciman controversy (from
  <i>quarta decima</i>, &quot;fourteenth&quot;) over whether Easter should coincide with 
  the 
  Passover on  Nisan 14 (as observed by the church in Jerusalem and Asia Minor, which 
  claimed their authority from the apostle John and his disciple Polycarp; cf. 
  Leviticus 23:5, &quot;In the fourteenth day of the first month at even is the 
  Lord's passover&quot;) or be celebrated only on Easter Sunday (as 
  insisted by the church at Rome, which 
  did not want an alignment with the Jewish calendar). It was a potential 
  schism that was effectively settled only by a promulgation from the First Council of Nicaea in AD 325.</font></p>
  <hr>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman" style="font-size: 16pt">In a 
  Germanic language such as English, the festival of Easter (<i>Ostern</i> in 
  German) 
  derives from Eostre, a pagan 
  goddess of the dawn and spring. The Old English word first is mentioned by 
  the English monk Bede in <i>De temporum ratione</i> (&quot;The Reckoning of Time&quot;), 
  written in AD 725, where he identified the month of April as <i>Eosturmonath</i> (§330).
  </font></p>
  <blockquote>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman" style="font-size: 16pt">&quot;Eosturmonath has a name which is now 
  translated 'Paschal month', and which was once called after a goddess of 
  theirs named Eostre, in whose honour feasts were celebrated in that month. Now 
  they designate that Paschal season by her name, calling the joys of the new 
  rite by the time-honoured name of the old observance&quot; (§331).</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman" style="font-size: 16pt">In the <i>Life of Charlemagne,</i> written 
  about a century later, the Frankish scholar Einhard relates that, among the reforms of Charles the 
  Great, &quot;He gave the months names in his own tongue, in place of the Latin and 
  barbarous names by which they were formerly known among the Franks&quot;<font color="#000000"> 
  (</font>XXIX). April was called </font><i><font style="font-size: 16pt">Ostaramonath</font></i><font face="Times New Roman" style="font-size: 16pt">, 
  &quot;Easter month,&quot; Ostara and Eostre being related to Eos, the Greek goddess of 
  dawn, heralding the arrival of spring. Jacob Grimm (the elder of the Brothers 
  Grimm) elaborates on the etymology in <i>Teutonic Mythology</i>, first 
  published in 1835. </font></p>
  <blockquote>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman" style="font-size: 16pt">&quot;This <i>Ostara</i>, like the AS. 
  [Anglo-Saxon] <i>Eastre</i>, 
  must in the heathen religion have denoted a higher being, whose worship was so 
  firmly rooted, that the christian teachers tolerated the name, and applied it 
  to one of their own grandest anniversaries....<i>Ostara</i>, <i>Eastre</i> 
  seems therefore to have been the divinity of the radiant dawn, of upspringing 
  light, a spectacle that brings joy and blessing, whose meaning could be easily 
  adapted to the resurrection-day of the christian's God&quot; (pp. 290–291).</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman" style="font-size: 16pt">Passover is
  <i>Pascha</i> in Greek, as transliterated from the Aramaic. This also is the 
  word for Easter in Latin and the Romance languages.</font></p>
  <hr>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman" style="font-size: 16pt">In Luke, Jesus is led 
  from the Sanhedrin to Pilate, but then from Pilate to Herod Antipas, and from 
  Herod back to Pilate (23:6–11). This notion of a peripatetic Jesus  is said to 
  have been one explanation for All Fool's Day (April 1), in which a trick was 
  to send the victim on a fool's errand—an ultimately needless and pointless 
  endeavor, as each person would allege that it always was the next person to be 
  seen.</font></p>
