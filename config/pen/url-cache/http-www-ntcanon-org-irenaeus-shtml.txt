<P>
Relatively little is known of the life of Irenaeus.
As a boy he had, as he delighted to point out, listened to the sermons of the
great bishop and martyr, <A HREF="Polycarp.shtml">Polycarp of Smyrna</A>,
who was regarded as a disciple of the apostles themselves.
Here he came to know, 'the genuine unadulterated gospel',
to which he remained faithful throughout his life.
Perhaps he also accompanied Polycarp on his journey to Rome in connection
with the controversy over the date of celebrating Easter (154 CE).
Later he went as a missionary to southern Gaul, where he became a presbyter at Lyons.
A Catholic Encyclopedia article is online at
<A HREF="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08130b.htm">St. Irenaeus</A>.

<P>
Irenaeus was absent from the city when the persecution there reached its zenith.
It seems that he had been sent to Rome by the Gallican churches in order to
confer with Pope Eleutherus, perhaps as a mediator in the Montanist disputes.
Evidently Irenaeus stayed in Rome for just a short time,
and soon after the end of the persecution we find him again in Lyons as the
successor to Bishop Pothinus (178).
When and how he died is unknown to us.
Jerome and others state that he died as a martyr in the persecution under
the Emperor Septimus Severus (202), but there is no certainty about this tradition.

<P>
In short, we know Irenaeus almost solely from his writings,
and these have not been preserved in their entirety.  These writings are:

<P>
The era in which Irenaeus lived was a time of expansion and inner tensions in the church.
In many cases Irenaeus acted as mediator between various contending factions.
The churches of Asia Minor (where he was probably born) continued to celebrate Easter
on the same date (the 14th of Nisan) as the Jews celebrated Passover,
whereas the Roman Church maintained that Easter should always be celebrated on a Sunday
(the day of the Resurrection).
Mediating between the parties, Irenaeus stated that differences in external factors,
such as dates of festivals, need not be so serious as to destroy church unity.

<P>
Irenaeus adopted a totally negative and unresponsive attitude, however,
toward <A HREF="Marcion.shtml">Marcion</A>,
a schismatic leader in Rome, and toward the <A HREF="Valentinus.shtml">Valentinians</A>,
a fashionable intellectual Gnostic movement in the rapidly expanding
church that espoused dualism.
Because Gnosticism was overcome by the Orthodox Church,
Gnostic writings were largely obliterated.
In reconstructing Gnostic doctrines, therefore,
modern scholars relied to a great extent on the writings of Irenaeus,
who summarized the Gnostic views before attacking them.
After the discovery of the Gnostic library near Nag Hammadi in Egypt in the 1940s
(see <A HREF="references.shtml#Robinson">Robinson</A>), respect for Irenaeus increased.
He was proved to have been extremely precise in his report of the doctrines he rejected.

<P>
The oldest lists of bishops also were countermeasures against the Gnostics,
who said that they possessed a secret oral tradition from Jesus himself.
Against such statements Irenaeus maintains that the bishops in different
cities are known as far back as the Apostles - and none of them was a Gnostic -
and that the bishops provided the only safe guide to the interpretation of the Scriptures.
With these lists of bishops the later doctrine of "the apostolic succession" of
the bishops could be linked.

<P>
From these 2 sources we can appreciate the importance of Irenaeus
as the first great Catholic theologian, the champion of orthodoxy against Gnostic heresy,
and a mediating link between Eastern and Western churches.

The Gospels could not possibly be either more or less in number than they are.
Since there are four zones of the world in which we live,
and four principal winds, while the Church is spread over all the earth,
and the pillar and foundation of the Church is the gospel,
and the Spirit of life, it fittingly has four pillars,
everywhere breathing out incorruption and revivifying men.
From this it is clear that the Word, the artificer of all things,
being manifested to men gave us the gospel,
fourfold in form but held together by one Spirit.
As David said, when asking for his coming,
</FONT>
<FONT COLOR="#800000">
'O sitter upon the cherubim, show yourself
</FONT>
<FONT COLOR="#000080">'.
For the cherubim have four faces, and their faces are images of the activity of the Son of God.
For the first living creature, it says, was like a lion,
signifying his active and princely and royal character;
the second was like an ox, showing his sacrificial and priestly order;
the third had the face of a man, indicating very clearly his coming
in human guise; and the fourth was like a flying eagle,
making plain the giving of the Spirit who broods over the Church.
Now the Gospels, in which Christ is enthroned, are like these.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<FONT COLOR="#000080">
When the blessed apostles had founded and built up the Church,
they handed over the ministry of the episcopate to Linus.
Paul mentions this Linus in his Epistles to Timothy.
Anencletus succeeded him.
After him Clement received the lot of the episcopate in the third place from the apostles.
He had seen the apostles and associated with them,
and still had their preaching sounding in his ears and their tradition before his eyes --
and not he alone, for there were many still left in his time who had been taught by the apostles.
In this Clement's time no small discord arose among the brethren in Corinth,
and the Church in Rome sent a very powerful letter to the Corinthians,
leading them to peace, renewing their faith, and declaring the tradition
which they had recently received from the apostles,
which declared one almighty God, maker of heaven and earth and fashioner
of man, who brought out the people from the land of Egypt; who spoke with Moses;
who ordained the Law and sent the Prophets;
and who has prepared fire for the devil and his angels.
Those who care to can learn from this Writing that he was proclaimed by
the churches as the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,
and so understand the apostolic tradition of the Church,
since this Epistle is older than those present false teachers
who make up lies about another God above the Demiurge and maker of all things that are.

But the followers of Valentinus, putting away all fear,

Indeed their audacity has gone so far that they entitle their
recent composition the Gospel of Truth,
though it agrees in nothing with the Gospels of the apostles,
and so no Gospel of theirs is free from blasphemy.
For if what they produce is the Gospel of Truth,

<H3>Irenaeus and the Gospel of Judas</H3>
<P>
Irenaeus writes in <i>Adversus Haereses</i>: 
<blockquote>
<FONT COLOR="#000080">
Others again declare that Cain derived his being from the Power above,
and acknowledge that Esau, Korah, the Sodomites, and all such persons,
are related to themselves.
On this account, they add, they
have been assailed by the Creator, yet no one of them has suffered injury.
For Sophia was in the habit of carrying off that which belonged to her from them to herself.
They declare that Judas the traitor was thoroughly acquainted with these things,
and that he alone, knowing the truth as no others did,
accomplished the mystery of the betrayal; by him all things, both earthly and heavenly,
were thus thrown into confusion.
They produce a fictitious history of this kind, which they style the Gospel of Judas.
