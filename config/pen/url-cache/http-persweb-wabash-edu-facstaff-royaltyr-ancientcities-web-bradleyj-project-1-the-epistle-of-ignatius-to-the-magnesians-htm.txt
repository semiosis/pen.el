<H2 style="text-align:center"><CENTER>The Epistle of Ignatius
to the Magnesians</CENTER></H2>

<P style="text-align:center"><CENTER>------------</CENTER></P>

<P style="margin-left:.5in"><I>Ignatius, who is also called Theophorus,
to the [Church] blessed in the grace of God the Father, in Jesus
Christ our Saviour, in whom I salute the Church which is at Magnesia,
near the Moeander, and wish it abundance of happiness in God the
father, and in Jesus Christ.</I></P>

<P style="margin-left:.5in">Chapter I.-Reason of Writing the Epistle.</P>

<P>Having been informed of your godlylove, so well-ordered, I
rejoiced greatly, and determined to commune with you in the faith
of Jesus Christ. For as one who has been thought worthy of the
most honourable of all names, in those bonds which I bear about,
I commend the Churches, in which I pray for a union both of the
flesh and spirit of Jesus Christ, the constant source of our life,
and of faith and love, to which nothing is to be preferred, but
especially of Jesus and the Father, in whom, if we endure all
the assaults of the prince of this world, and escape them, we
shall enjoy God.</P>

<P style="text-indent:.5in">Chapter II.-I Rejoice in Your Messengers.</P>

<P>Since, then, I have had the privilege of seeing you, through
Damas your most worthy bishop, and through your worthy presbyters
Bassus and Apollonius, and through my fellow-servant the deacon
Sotio, whose friendship may I ever enjoy, inasmuch as he is subject
to the bishop as to the grace of God, and to the presbytery as
to the law of Jesus Christ, [I now write to you].</P>

<P style="margin-left:.5in">Chapter III.-Honour Your Youthful
Bishop.</P>

<P>Now it becomes you also not to treat your bishop too familiarly
on account of his youth, but to yield him all reverence, having
respect tothe power of God the Father, as I have known even holy
presbyters do, not judging rashly, from the manifest youthful
appearance [of their bishop], but as being themselves prudent
in God, submitting to him, or rather not to him, but to the Father
of Jesus Christ, the bishop of us all. It is therefore fitting
that you should, after no hypocritical fashion, obey [your bishop],
in honour of Him who has wired us [so to do], since he that does
not so deceives not [by such conduct] the bishop that is visible,
but seeks to mock Him that is invisible. And all such conduct
has reference not to man, but to God, who knows all secrets.</P>

<P style="margin-left:.5in">Chapter IV.-Some Wickedly Act Independently
of the Bishop.</P>

<P>It is fitting, then, not only to be called Christians, but
to be so in reality: as some indeed give one the title of bishop,
but do all things without him. Now such persons seem to me to
be not possessed of a good conscience, seeing they are not stedfastly
gathered together according to the commandment.</P>

<P style="margin-left:.5in">Chapter V.-Death is the Fate of All
Such.</P>

<P>Seeing, then, all things have an end, these two things are
simultaneously set before us-death and life; and every one shall
go unto his own place. For as there are two kinds of coins, the
one of God, the other of the world, and each of these has its
special character stamped upon it, [so is it also here.] The unbelieving
are of this world; but the believing have, in love, the character
of God the Father by Jesus Christ, by whom, if we are not in readiness
to die into His passion, His life is not in us.</P>

<P style="margin-left:.5in">Chapter VI.-Preserve Harmony.</P>

<P>Since therefore I have, in the persons before mentioned, beheld
the whole multitude of you in faith and love, I exhort you to
study to do all things with a divine harmony, while your bishop
presides in the place of God, and your presbyters in the place
of the assembly of the apostles, along with your deacons, who
are most dear to me, and are entrusted with the ministry of Jesus
Christ, who was with the Father before the beginning of time,
and in the end was revealed. Do ye all then, imitating the same
divine conduct, pay respect to one another, and let no one look
upon his neighbour after the flesh, but do ye continually love
each other in Jesus Christ. Let nothing exist among you that may
divide you ; but be ye united with your bishop, and those that
preside over you, as a type and evidence of your immortality.</P>

<P style="margin-left:.5in">Chapter VII.-Do Nothing Without the
Bishop and Presbyters.</P>

<P>As therefore the Lord did nothing without the Father, being
united to Him, neither by Himself nor by the apostles, so neither
do ye anything without the bishop and presbyters. Neither endeavour
that anything appear reasonable and proper to yourselves apart;
but being come together into the same place, let there be one
prayer, one supplication, one mind, one hope, in love and in joy
undefiled. There is one Jesus Christ, than whom nothing is more
excellent. Do ye therefore all run together as into one temple
of God, as to one altar, as to one Jesus Christ, who came forth
from one Father, and is with and has gone to one.</P>

<P style="margin-left:.5in">Chapter VIII.-Caution Against False
Doctrines.</P>

<P>Be not deceived with strange doctrines, nor with old fables,
which are unprofitable. For if we still live according to the
Jewish law, we acknowledge that we have not received grace. For
the divinest prophets lived according to Christ Jesus. On this
account also they were persecuted, being inspired by His grace
to fully convince the unbelieving that there is one God, who has
manifested Himself by Jesus Christ His Son, who is His eternal
Word, not proceeding forth from silence, and who in all things
pleased Him that sent Him.</P>

<P style="margin-left:.5in">Chapter IX.-Let Us Live with Christ.</P>

<P>If, therefore, those who were brought up in the ancient order
of things have come to the possession of a newhope, no longer
observing the Sabbath, but living in the observance of the Lord's
Day, on which also our life has sprung up again by Him and by
His death-whom some deny, by which mystery we have obtained faith,
and therefore endure, that we may be found the disciples of Jesus
Christ, our only Master-how shall we be able to live apart from
Him, whose disciples the prophets themselves in the Spirit did
wait for Him as their Teacher? And therefore He whom they rightly
waited for, being come, raised them from the dead.</P>

<P style="margin-left:.5in">Chapter X.-Beware of Judaizing.</P>

<P>Let us not, therefore, be insensible to His kindness. For were
He to reward us according to our works, we should cease to be.
Therefore, having become His disciples, let us learn to live according
to the principles of Christianity. For whosoever is called by
any other name besides this, is not of God. Lay aside, therefore,
the evil, the old, the sour leaven, and be ye changed into the
new leaven, which is Jesus Christ. Be ye salted in Him, lest any
one among you should be corrupted, since by your savour ye shall
be convicted. It is absurd to profess Christ Jesus, and to Judaize.
For Christianity did not embrace Judaism, but Judaism Christianity,
that so every tongue which believeth might be gathered together
to God.</P>

<P style="margin-left:.5in">Chapter XI.-I Write These Things to
Warn You.</P>

<P>These things [I address to you], my beloved, not that I know
any of you to be in such a state; but, as less than any of you,
I desire to guard you beforehand, that ye fall not upon the hooks
of vain doctrine, but that ye attain to full assurance in regard
to the birth, and passion, and resurrection which took place in
the time of the government of Pontius Pilate, being truly and
certainly accomplished by Jesus Christ, who is our hope, from
which may no one of you ever be turned aside.</P>

<P style="margin-left:.5in">Chapter XII.-Ye are Superior to Me.</P>

<P>May I enjoy you in all respects, if indeed I be worthy! For
though I am bound, I am not worthy to be compared to any of you
that are at liberty. I know that ye are not puffed up, for ye
have Jesus Christ in yourselves. And all the more when I commend
you, I know that ye cherish modesty of spirit; as it is written,
&quot;The righteous man is his own accuser.&quot;</P>

<P style="margin-left:.5in">Chapter XIII.-Be Established in Faith
and Unity.</P>

<P>Study, therefore, to be established in the doctrines of the
Lord and the apostles, that so all things, whatsoever ye do, may
prosper both in the flesh and spirit; in faith and love; in the
Son, and in the Father, and in the Spirit; in the beginning and
in the end; with your most admirable bishop, and the well-compacted
spiritual crown of your presbytery, and the deacons who are according
to God. Be ye subject to the bishop, and to one another, as Jesus
Christ to the Father, according to the flesh, and the apostles
to Christ, and to the Father, and to the Spirit; that so there
may be a union both fleshly and spiritual.</P>

<P style="margin-left:.5in">Chapter XIV.-Your Prayers Requested.</P>

<P>Knowing as I do that ye are full of God, I have but briefly
exhorted you. Be mindful of me in your prayers, that I may attain
to God; and of the Church which is in Syria, whence I am not worthy
to derive my name: for I stand in need of your united prayer in
God, and your love, that the Church which is in Syria may be &quot;deemed
worthy of being refreshed<sup> </sup>by your Church.</P>

<P style="margin-left:.5in">Chapter XV.-Salutations.</P>

<P>The Ephesians from Smyrna (whence I also write to you), who
are here for the glory of God, as ye also are, who have in all
things refreshed me, salute you, along with Polycarp, the bishop
of the Smyrnaeans. The rest of the Churches, in honour of Jesus
Christ, also salute you. Fare ye well in the harmony of God, ye
who have obtained the inseparable Spirit, who is Jesus Christ.</P>
