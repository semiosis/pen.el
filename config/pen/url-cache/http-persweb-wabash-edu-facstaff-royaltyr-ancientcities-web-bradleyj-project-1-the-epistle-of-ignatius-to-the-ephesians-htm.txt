<H2 style="text-align:center"><CENTER>The Epistle of Ignatius
to the Ephesians</CENTER></H2>

<P style="text-align:center"><CENTER>------------</CENTER></P>

<P style="margin-left:.5in"><I>Ignatius, who is also called Theophorus,
to the Church which is at Ephesus, in Asia, deservedly most happy,
being blessed in the greatness and fulness of God the Father,
and predestinated before the beginning of time, that it should
be always for an enduring and unchangeable glory, being united
and elected through the true passion by the will of the Father,
and Jesus Christ, our God: Abundant happiness through Jesus Christ,
and His undefiled grace.</I></P>

<P style="margin-left:.5in">Chapter I.-Praise of the Ephesians.</P>

<P>I have become acquainted with your name, much-beloved in God,
which ye have acquired by the habit of righteousness, according
to the faith and love in Jesus Christ our Saviour. Being the followers
of God, and stirring up yourselves by the blood of God, ye have
perfectly accomplished the work which was beseeming to you. For,
on hearing that I came bound from Syria for the common name and
hope, trusting through your prayers to be permitted to fight with
beasts at Rome, that so by martyrdom I may indeed become the disciple
of Him &quot;who gave Himself for us, an offering and sacrifice
to God,&quot; [ye hastened to see me ]. I received, therefore,
your whole multitude in the name of God, through Onesimus, a man
of inexpressible love and your bishop in the flesh, whom I pray
you by Jesus Christ to love, and that you would all seek to be
like him. And blessed be He who has granted unto you, being worthy,
to obtain such an excellent bishop.</P>

<P style="margin-left:.5in">Chapter II.-Congratulations and Entreaties.</P>

<P>As to my fellow-servant Burrhus, your deacon in regard to God
and blessed in all things I beg that he may continue longer, both
for your honour and that of your bishop. And Crocus also, worthy
both of God and you, whom I have received as the manifestation
of your love, hath in all things refreshed me, as the Father of
our Lord Jesus Christ shall also refreshhim; together with Onesimus,
and Burrhus, and Euplus, and Fronto, by means of whom, I have,
as to love, beheld all of you. May I always have joy of you, if
indeed I be worthy of it. It is therefore befitting that you should
in every way glorify Jesus Christ, who hath glorified you, that
by a unanimous obedience &quot;ye may be perfectly joined together
in the same mind, and in the same judgment, and may all speak
the same thing concerning the same thing&#148; and that, being
subject to the bishop and the presbytery, ye may in all respects
be sanctified.</P>

<P style="margin-left:.5in">Chapter III.-Exhortations to Unity.</P>

<P>I do not issue orders to you, as if I were some great person.
For though I am bound for the name [of Christ], I am not yet perfect
in Jesus Christ. For now I begin to be a disciple, and I speak
to you as fellow-disciples with me. For it was needful for me
to have been stirred up by you in faith, exhortation, patience,
and long-suffering. But inasmuch as love suffers me not to be
silent in regard to you, I have therefore takenupon me first to
exhort you that ye would all run together in accordance with the
will of God. For even Jesus Christ, our inseparable life, is the
[manifested] will of the Father; as also bishops, settled everywhere
to the utmost bounds [of the earth], are so by the will of Jesus
Christ.</P>

<P style="margin-left:.5in">Chapter IV.-The Same Continued.</P>

<P>Wherefore it is fitting that ye should run together in accordance
with the will of your bishop, which thing also ye do. For your
justly renowned presbytery, worthy of God, is fitted as exactly
to the bishop as the strings are to the harp. Therefore in your
concord and harmonious love, Jesus Christ is sung. And do ye,
man by man, become a choir, that being harmonious in love, and
taking up the song of God in unison, ye may with one voice sing
to the Father through Jesus Christ, so that He may both hear you,
and perceive by your works that ye are indeed the members of His
Son. It is profitable, therefore, that you should live in an unblameable
unity, that thus ye may always enjoy communion with God.</P>

<P style="margin-left:.5in">Chapter V.-The Praise of Unity.</P>

<P>For if I in this brief space of time, have enjoyed such fellowship
with your bishop-I mean not of a mere human, but of a spiritual
nature-how much more do I reckon you happy who are so joined to
him as the Church is to Jesus Christ, and as Jesus Christ is to
the Father, that so all things may agree in unity! Let no man
deceive himself: if any one be not within the altar, he is deprived
of the bread of God. For if the prayer of one or two possesses
such power, how much more that of the bishop and the whole Church!
He, therefore, that does not assemble with the Church, has even
by this manifested his pride, and condemned himself. For it is
written, &quot;God resisteth the proud.&#148; Let us be careful,
then, not to set ourselves in opposition to the bishop, in order
that we may be subject to God.</P>

<P style="margin-left:.5in">Chapter VI.-Have Respect to the Bishop
as to Christ Himself.</P>

<P>Now the more any one sees the bishop keeping silence, the more
ought he to revere him. For we ought to receive every one whom
the Master of the house sends to be over His household, as we
would do Him that sent him. It is manifest, therefore, that we
should look upon the bishop even as we would upon the Lord Himself.
And indeed Onesimus himself greatly commends your good order in
God, that ye all live according to the truth, and that no sect
has any dwelling-place among you. Nor, indeed, do ye hearken to
any one rather than to Jesus Christ speaking in truth.</P>

<P style="margin-left:.5in">Chapter VII.-Beware of False Teachers.</P>

<P>For some are in the habit of carrying about the name [of Jesus
Christ] in wicked guile, while yet they practise things unworthy
of God, whom ye must flee as ye would wild beasts. For they are
ravening dogs, who bite secretly, against whom ye must be on your
guard, inasmuch as they are men who can scarcely be cured. There
is one Physician who is possessed both of flesh and spirit; both
made and not made; God existing in flesh; true life in death;
both of Mary and of God; first possible and then impossible,-
even Jesus Christ our Lord.</P>

<P style="margin-left:.5in">Chapter VIII.-Renewed Praise of the
Ephesians.</P>

<P>Let not then any one deceive you, as indeed ye are not deceived,
inasmuch as ye are wholly devoted to God. For since there is no
strife raging among you which might distress you, ye are certainly
living in accordance with God's will. I am far inferior to you,
and require to be sanctified by your Church of Ephesus, so renowned
throughout the world. They that are carnal cannot do those things
which are spiritual, nor they that are spiritual the things which
are carnal; even as faith cannot do the works of unbelief, nor
unbelief the works of faith. But even those things which ye do
according to the flesh are spiritual; for ye do all things in
Jesus Christ.</P>

<P style="margin-left:.5in">Chapter IX.-Ye Have Given No Heed
to False Teachers.</P>

<P>Nevertheless, I have heard of some who have passed on from
this to you, having false doctrine, whom ye did not suffer to
sow among you, but stopped your ears, that ye might not receive
those things which were sown by them, as being stonesof the temple
of the Father, prepared for the building of God the Father, and
drawn up on high by the instrument of Jesus Christ, which is the
cross making use of the Holy Spirit as a rope, while your faith
was the means by which you ascended, and your love the way which
led up to God. Ye, therefore, as well as all your fellow-travellers,
are God-bearers, temple-bearers, Christ-bearers, bearers of holiness,
adorned in all respects with the commandments of Jesus Christ,
in whom also I exult that I have been thought worthy, by means
of this Epistle, to converse and rejoice with you, because with
respect to your Christian life ye love nothing but God only.</P>

<P style="margin-left:.5in">Chapter X.-Exhortations to Prayer,
Humility, Etc.</P>

<P>And pray ye without ceasing in behalf of other men. For there
is in them hope of repentance that they may attain to God. See,
then, that they be instructed by your works, if in no other way.
Be ye meek in response to their wrath, humble in opposition to
their boasting: to their blasphemies return your prayers; in contrast
to their error, be ye stedfast in the faith; and for their cruelty,
manifest your gentleness. While we take care not to imitate their
conduct, let us be found their brethren in all true kindness;
and let us seek to be followers of the Lord (who ever more unjustly
treated, more destitute, more condemned? ), that so no plant of
the devil may be found in you, but ye may remain in all holiness
and sobriety in Jesus Christ, both with respect to the flesh and
spirit.</P>

<P style="margin-left:.5in">Chapter XI.-An Exhortation to Fear
God, Etc.</P>

<P>The last times are come upon us. Let us therefore be of a reverent
spirit, and fear the long-suffering of God, that it tend not to
our condemnation. For let us either stand in awe of the wrath
to come, or show regard for the grace which is at present displayed-one
of two things. Only [in one way or another] let us be found in
Christ Jesus unto the true life. Apart from Him, let nothing attract
you, for whom I bear about these bonds, these spiritual jewels,
by which may I arise through your prayers, of which I entreat
I may always be a partaker, that I may be found in the lot of
the Christians of Ephesus, who have always been of the same mind
with the apostles through the power of Jesus Christ.</P>

<P style="margin-left:.5in">Chapter XII.-Praise of the Ephesians.</P>

<P>I know both who I am, and to whom I write. I am a condemned
man, ye have been the objects of mercy; I am subject to danger,
ye are established in safety. Ye are the persons through whom
those pass that are cut off for the sake of God. Ye are initiated
into the mysteries of the Gospel with Paul, the holy, the martyred,
the deservedly most happy, at whose feet may I be found, when
I shall attain to God; who in all his Epistles makes mention of
you in Christ Jesus.</P>

<P style="text-indent:.5in">Chapter XIII.-Exhortation to Meet
Together Frequently for the Worship of God.</P>

<P>Take heed, then, often to come together to give thanks to God,
and show forth His praise. For when ye assemble frequently in
the same place, the powers of Satan are destroyed, and the destruction
at which he aims is prevented by the unity of your faith. Nothing
is more precious than peace, by which all war, both in heaven
and earth is brought to an end.</P>

<P style="text-indent:.5in">Chapter XIV.-Exhortations to Faith
and Love.</P>

<P>None of these things is hid from you, if ye perfectly possess
that faith and love towards Christ Jesus which are the beginning
and the end of life. For the beginning is faith, and the end is
love.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Now these two,
being inseparably connected together, are of God, while all other
things which are requisite for a holy life follow after them.
No man [truly] making a profession of faith sinneth; nor does
he that possesses love hate any one. The tree is made manifest
by its fruit; so those that profess themselves to be Christians
shall be recognised by their conduct. For there is not now a demand
for mere profession, but that a man be found continuing in the
power of faith to the end.</P>

<P style="margin-left:.5in">Chapter XV.-Exhortation to Confess
Christ by Silence as Well as Speech.</P>

<P>It is better for a man to be silent and be [a Christian], than
to talk and not to be one. It is good to teach, if he who speaks
also acts. There is then one Teacher, who spake and it was done;
while even those things which He did in silence are worthy of
the Father. He who possesses the word of Jesus, is truly able
to hear even His very silence, that he may be perfect, and may
both act as he speaks, and be recognised by his silence. There
is nothing which is hid from God, but our very secrets are near
to Him. Let us therefore do all things as those who have Him dwelling
in us, that we may be His temples, and He may be in us as our
God, which indeed He is, and will manifest Himself before our
faces. Wherefore we justly love Him.</P>

<P style="text-indent:.5in">Chapter XVI.-The Fate of False Teachers.</P>

<P>Do not err, my brethren. Those that corrupt families shall
not inherit the kingdom of God. If, then, those who do this as
respects the flesh have suffered death, how much more shall this
be the case with any one who corrupts by wicked doctrine the faith
of God, for which Jesus Christ was crucified! Such an one becoming
defiled [in this way], shall go away into everlasting fire, and
so shall every one that hearkens unto him.</P>

<P style="margin-left:.5in">Chapter XVII.-Beware of False Doctrines.</P>

<P>For this end did the Lord suffer the ointment to be poured
upon His head, that He might breathe immortality into His Church.
Be not ye anointed with the bad odour of the doctrine of the prince
of this world; let him not lead you away captive from the life
which is set before you. And why are we not all prudent, since
we have received the knowledge of God, which is Jesus Christ?
Why do we foolishly perish, not recognising the gift which the
Lord has of a truth sent to us?</P>

<P style="text-indent:.5in">Chapter XVIII.-The Glory of the Cross.</P>

<P>Let my spirit be counted as nothingfor the sake of the cross,
which is a stumbling-block to those that do not believe, but to
us salvation and life eternal. &quot;Where is the wise man? where
the disputer? &quot;Where is the boasting of those who are styled
prudent? For our God, Jesus Christ, was, according to the appointment<sup>
</sup>of God, conceived in the womb by Mary, of the seed of David,
but by the Holy Ghost. He was born and baptized, that by His passion
He might purify the water.</P>

<P style="margin-left:.5in">Chapter XIX.-Three Celebrated Mysteries.</P>

<P>Now the virginity of Mary was hidden from the prince of this
world, as was also her offspring, and the death of the Lord; three
mysteries of renown, which were wrought in silence by God. How,
then, was He manifested to the world? A star shone forth in heaven
above all the other stars, the light of which was inexpressible,
while its novelty struck men with astonishment. And all the rest
of the stars, with the sun and moon, formed a chorus to this star,
and its light was exceedingly great above them all. And there
was agitation felt as to whence this new spectacle came, so unlike
to everything else [in the heavens]. Hence every kind of magic
was destroyed, and every bond of wickedness disappeared; ignorance
was removed, and the old kingdom abolished, God Himself being
manifested in human form for the renewal of eternal life. And
now that took a beginning which had been prepared by God. Henceforth
all things were in a state of tumult, because He meditated the
abolition of death.</P>

<P style="text-indent:.5in">Chapter XX.-Promise of Another Letter.</P>

<P style="text-indent:.5in">Chapter XX.-Exhortations to Stedfastness
and Unity.</P>

<P>If Jesus Christ shall graciously permit me through your prayers,
and if it be His will, I shall, in a second little work which
I will write to you, make further manifest to you [the nature
of] the dispensation of which I have begun [to treat], with respect
to the new man, Jesus Christ, in His faith and in His love, in
His suffering and in His resurrection. Especially [will I do this]
if the Lord make known to me that ye come together man by man
in common through grace, individually, in one faith, and in Jesus
Christ, who was of the seed of David according to the flesh, being
both the Son of man and the Son of God, so that ye obey the bishop
and the presbytery with an undivided mind, breaking one and the
same bread, which is the medicine of immortality, and the antidote
to prevent us from dying, but [which causes] that we should live
for ever in Jesus Christ.</P>

<P style="text-indent:.5in">Chapter XXI.-Conclusion.</P>

<P>My soul be for yours and theirs whom, for the honour of God,
ye have sent to Smyrna; whence also I write to you, giving thanks
unto the Lord, and loving Polycarp even as I do you. Remember
me, as Jesus Christ also remembered you. Pray ye for the Church
which is in Syria, whence I am led bound to Rome, being the last
of the faithful who are there, even as I have been thought worthy
to be chosento show forth the honour of God. Farewell in God the
Father, and in Jesus Christ, our common hope.</P>
