    <h1 align="center">Heresies of Calvinism</h1>
    While Calvinists view Calvinism as the standard by which the Bible
    is
    to be interpreted rather than allowing the tenets of Calvinism to be
    scrutinized by the Bible, such is not the case for many of us
    Christians who are of a Berean mindset, who scrutize everything in
    light of scripture. For<font color="#990000"> "the Bereans were of
      more
      noble character than the Thessalonians, for they received the
      message
      with great eagerness and examined the Scriptures every day to see
      if
      what Paul said was true." </font><b>Acts 17:11</b> All opinions
    and
    alleged inspirational ideas are to be subject to scrutiny.<font
      color="#990000"> "Let two or three prophets speak, and let the
      others
      judge." </font><b>1Cor 14:29</b> God called us not to show
    favoritism
    as some do, sacrificing truth for the sake of institutional
    allegiance.
    Regardless of the celebrity status that some post-Biblical
    theologians
    of the past or present hold, regardless of one's popularity or the
    popularity of certain theological concepts, <font color="#990000">"Do
not
      believe every spirit, but test the spirits to see whether they are
      from God, because many false prophets have gone out into the
      world." </font><b>1John
      4:1</b><br>
    <br>
    I have studied Calvinism and its basis in Augustinian theology. I
    have
    discussed these ideas and debated with Calvinists. I believe I am
    representing Calvinism accurately in this article. But if there are
    Calvinists who think otherwise let them say so. And I also challenge
    Calvinists to prove their theological heresies, which I'll present,
    to
    be scripturally sound.<br>
    <h3 align="center">The Unjust god of Calvinism</h3>
    Now <u><b>one of the main assumptions of Calvinism is that God
        holds people
        accountable for things over which they have no control</b></u>,
    imputing guilt to the innocent, which is unjust and in contrast to
    what the Bible says of God's character, <font color="#990000">"God
      is just" </font><b>2Th 1:6 </b><br>
    <br>
    <u><b>Example #1:</b></u> Calvinists hold that God reckons the guilt
    of Adam's sin to everyone. If it is unjust to impute the guilt of a
    crime to those who didn't actually commit the crime, then Calvinists
    portray God as being unjust, for such a thing is not just but
    prejudice.<br>
    <blockquote><u><b>Supporting Evidence</b></u>: Augustine largely
      originated the Calvinist concept of Original Sin. Augustine speaks
      of this for example in his book 1
      chapter 46 entitled, <i>"it is probable that children are
        involved in
        the guilt not only of the first pair, but of their own immediate
        parents." </i>whereas the Bible says<i>,</i> <font
        color="#990000">"Fathers
        shall not be put to death for their children, nor children put
        to death
        for their fathers; each is to die for his own sin."</font> <b>Deut
        24:16</b> And likewise for a more modern Calvinist, take John
      Gill for example, says concerning Rom 5:18,19, "<i>though the
        posterity of Adam are habitually sinners, that is, derive
        corrupt nature from Adam, yet this is not meant here; but that
        they are become guilty, through <u>the imputation of his sin to
          them</u>; for it is by the disobedience of another they are
        made sinners, which must be by the imputation of that
        disobedience to them; he sinned, and they sinned in him, when
        they had as yet no actual existence; which could be no other
        way, than by imputation, as he was reckoned and accounted their
        head and representative, and they reckoned and accounted in him,
        and so have sinned in him."</i><br>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote><u><b>An Alternate Interpretation</b></u>: a
      non-Calvinistic viewpoint in this matter is that people are not
      born with the guilt of Adam's sin, but with a sinful nature, a
      nature inclined to sin. People are not held accountable for their
      human nature, but for their actions. While the sinful human nature
      encloses a person in an environment of temptation to sin, a person
      is not guilty unless they act upon that nature. <br>
    </blockquote>
    <u><b>Example #2</b></u>: Calvinists hold that God imputed the guilt
    of sins to Jesus Christ, sins of which Jesus Christ didn't actually
    commit. <br>
    <blockquote><u><b>Supporting Evidence</b></u>: John Gill (Calvinist)
      on 2Cor 5:21 <i>"he was made sin itself by imputation; the sins
        of all his people were transferred unto him,&nbsp; laid upon
        him,&nbsp; and placed to his account; he sustained&nbsp; their
        persons,&nbsp; and bore their sins; and having them upon
        him,&nbsp; and being chargeable with,&nbsp; and answerable for
        them,&nbsp; <u>he was treated by the justice of God as if he
          had been not only a sinner,&nbsp; but a mass of sin</u>"</i>.
      Thus, in their misreading of that verse and others, they portray
      God as crucifying Christ as if reckoning Christ to be actually
      guilty of sins he didn't actually commit. This despite the fact
      that the Bible portrays those who crucified Christ as wicked men
      in doing so, <font color="#990000">"you, with the help of wicked
        men, put him to death by nailing him to the cross."</font> <b>Acts
        2:23</b> But why were they characterized as wicked if it was a
      just act to put Christ to death? Calvinists portray God as playing
      the role of the wicked man torturing the innocent man to death. <br>
      <br>
      <u><b>An Alternate Interpretation</b></u>: God is just and as such
      compensates innocent victims of unjustified suffering. <font
        color="#990000">"God is just: He will pay back trouble to those
        who trouble you and give relief to you who are troubled"</font>
      <b>2Th 1:6,7a </b><font color="#990000">"If you suffer for doing
        good and you endure it, this is commendable before God. To this
        you were called, because Christ suffered for you, leaving you an
        example, that you should follow in his steps."</font> <b>1Peter
        2:20-21</b> Though Christ was publicly reckoned a sinner by the
      wicked, he was an innocent victim of unjustified suffering and as
      such justice demanded he be compensated, and with that
      compensation paid our debt. For he <font color="#990000">"gave
        His life a ransom for many".</font><b> Mt 20:28</b><br>
    </blockquote>
    <h3 align="center">The Logical Irrelevance of Christ's Death under
      Calvinism</h3>
    Now since God is unjust under Calvinism, Christ didn't have to die.
    For
    if Christ's death had to do with satisfying God's judicial nature,
    as
    the Bible indicates, what's up with that, seeing as under Calvinism
    God
    doesn't have a judicial nature as has been proven above.<br>
    <h3 align="center">A Puppet theology - Calvinist denial of Free Will</h3>
    Under Calvinism people are essentially puppets.&nbsp; Calvinism
    teaches, <i>"Total Depravity without free will permanently due to
      divine sovereignty"</i> <a
      href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calvinism">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calvinism</a>
    It's a hard form of theological determinism. <a
      href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theological_determinism">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theological_determinism</a>
    <i>"Perhaps the most prominent theologian to espouse hard
      theological determinism was John Calvin" ... " It claims that free
      will does not exist, and </i><i>God</i><i> has absolute control
      over a person's actions." </i>To the Calvinist for people to do
    anything from their free will takes away God's sovereignty, and thus
    they deny free will. Their "god" is incapable of creating free will
    creatures. He just doesn't have the capacity to do so. Now because
    their "god" is unjust, they of course have no problem with the idea
    of
    god imputing guilt to these puppets and throwing them into hell.
    Truly
    the god of Calvinism is a sadistic monster. Under Calvinism people
    cannot but sin. They have no choice but to sin. And where there is
    only
    one choice that is the same as saying there is no choice. <br>
    <br>
    The god of Calvinism is rather peculiar. He speaks in the
    imperative,
    giving lots of commands to his puppets who apparently have no
    ability
    with which to act upon such commands. And then he holds them
    accountable for what they have done or failed to do. The god of
    Calvinism is pretty much nuts. But it would seem the Calvinist is
    likewise nuts. Have they taken any
    thought to the implications of their doctrines? Are they just a
    bunch
    of mindless denominational zombies (or might I say "puppets"?) so
    indoctrinated into their heresies? Consider, if people are just
    puppets
    as the Calvinists propose, then who is doing the sinning? Would the
    Calvinists deny their god's sovereignty in that realm? <br>
    <h3 align="center">Calvinistic Heresies of Election</h3>
    Concerning election, one of the heresies of Calvinism is that God
    doesn't want all men to be saved but rather only wishes a variety of
    men be saved, as He has chosen in puppet-like fashion. According to
    their doctrines, when they preach the gospel they cannot say that <i>"God
loves
      you and wants you to have eternal life". </i>In fact under
    Calvinism
    they should say, <i>"God may hate you and may have predestined you
      to
      eternal damnation and there's nothing that can be done about it."</i>
    For example Mark Driscoll co-founder of the Acts 29 Calvinist
    organization speaking for God says,<i> "God looks down and says 'I
      hate
      you, you are my enemy, and I will crush you" </i>Funny
    how the Bible commands us to love our enemies without prejudice
    while
    Calvinists view that same God as hating people prejudicially. Indeed
    under Calvinism God prejudges people before they are even born. Not
    suprising how Calvinists often turn out, given their concepts of
    God. <br>
    <br>
    Also under Calvinism Christ didn't die for the sins of the world,
    but
    only for the sins of the elect. In contrast the Bible says, <font
      color="#990000">"He is the atoning sacrifice for our sins, and not
      only for ours but also for the sins of the whole world."</font><b>
      1John 2:2</b><br>
    <h3 align="center">The Calvinistic Heresy of Regeneration</h3>
    According to the Bible,<font color="#990000"> "to those who believed
      in
      his name, he gave the right to become children of God—"</font>. <b>John
      1:12b</b> That is, people are not given the right to become
    children of
    God until they believe in Christ. <b>Gal 3:26<font color="#990000">
      </font></b><font color="#990000">"You are all sons of God through
      faith in Christ
      Jesus,"</font> But Calvinists have it backwards. Under Calvinism a
    person cannot believe until he's been born of God. They get the
    order
    of faith and regeneration backwards. <br>
    <h3 align="center">Infant Baptism and the Trivialization of Faith</h3>
    Now while some will argue that the heresy of infant baptism is not a
    part of Calvinism, in fact it was very much a part of Calvin's
    theology. In fact in Calvin's day Calvinists would put Christians to
    death who didn't believe in infant baptism. Today many so called
    "Calvinists" would have have been murdered by their own theological
    forefathers, had they gone back in time for a visit!<br>
    <br>
    Padeobaptism is an application of Calvinism. Babies, who have yet to
    believe in Christ, are baptized into the faith and reckoned members
    of
    the Church apart from faith in Christ. This heresy is NO DIFFERENT
    than
    what Paul wrote to the Galatians concerning the heresy of the
    circumcision. Indeed Calvinism, drawing on Augustine's writings,
    likens
    baptism to circumcision, which was done to infants when they were
    just
    8 days old. So this ceremony in which some ceremony is performed on
    the
    flesh of an infant is construed as reflecting his righteous status
    with
    God, regardless of the faith of the infant. <br>
    <br>
    These examples of putting regeneration and election prior to faith,
    and
    this heresy of padeobaptism reflect the Calvinist's trivialization
    of
    saving faith. Indeed "faith" to the Calvinist is merely a gift,
    merely
    a byproduct of salvation rather than the means to be saved. For the
    Bible says, <font color="#990000">"Therefore, having been justified
      by
      faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ" </font><b>Rom
      5:1<br>
      <br>
    </b>Furthermore, to quote a Calvinist <i>"For Calvin, covenant
      infants
      are baptized on largely the grounds that adults are baptized-we
      assume
      they are believers. In other words, infant baptism is, as it were,
      believers' baptism." </i>Calvin had a ravenous hatred of those
    opposed
    his opinion concerning infant baptism, declaring a curse on those
    who
    didn't baptize their infants.<i> "God will take vengeance on every
      one
      who despises to impress the symbol of&nbsp; the covenant on his
      child,
      (Genesis 17: 15) such contempt being a rejection, and, as it were,
      abjuration of the offered grace."</i> And he exercises such
    contempt
    rather violently as he says, <i>"God furnishes us with other
      weapons
      to repress their stupidity." </i>Cutting people's heads off and
    burning alleged heretics with fire - these were the weapons God
    furnished him with.<br>
    <div align="center">
      <h3>The Calvinistic Heresy of non-Salvation</h3>
    </div>
    Under Calvinism people are not saved or unsaved. They are either
    elect
    or non-elect, and their elect status is assigned to them before they
    are born. Thus even from their birth, the elect are never really not
    saved. Under Calvinism the salvation status of the elect has no
    correlation to their faith.<br>
    <div align="center">
      <h3>The Calvinistic Heresy of Double Predestination</h3>
      <p align="left"><b>Institutes of the Christian Religion Chapter
          21.</b></p>
      <p align="left"><b>Of the eternal election,</b><b> by which god
          has predestinated some to salvation, and others to
          destruction. </b>(title is Calvin's)<br>
        <br>
        <i>"All are not created on equal terms, but some are preordained
          to eternal life, others to eternal damnation"</i><i><br>
        </i><i><br>
        </i><i>"The predestination by which God adopts some to the hope
          of life, and adjudges others to eternal death, no man who
          would be thought pious ventures simply to deny; but it is
          greatly caviled at, especially by those who make prescience
          its cause."</i><br>
