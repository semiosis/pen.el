I'm told that key servers carry many phony keys claiming to be mine.
Here is info about which keys are really mine.
</p>

<p>
Old key (don't use it nowadays)
</p>

<pre>
pub   1024D/135EA668 2001-03-05
uid                  Richard Stallman (Chief GNUisance) &lt;rms@gnu.org&gt;
sub   1024g/B1B10ED6 2001-03-05
</pre>

<p>
<a href="/rms-pubkey.txt">New key</a>
</p>

<pre>
pub   4096R/2C6464AF2A8E4C02 2013-07-20
      Key fingerprint = 6781 9B34 3B2A B70D ED93  2087 2C64 64AF 2A8E 4C02
uid                  Richard Stallman &lt;rms@gnu.org&gt;
sub   4096R/2F30A2E162853425 2013-07-20
</pre>

<p>
Of course, to be really sure which key is mine,
you need to get my key fingerprint from me
or follow a chain of signatures.  If a phony key
appears to be signed by someone you trust, you should
see what's up with that person.
</p>

<p>
If you want an encrypted response, you must send me your key, because
I don't use key servers.  I don't promise to keep it permanently if we
don't talk often, so if you talk with me again a year later you should
send it again.
