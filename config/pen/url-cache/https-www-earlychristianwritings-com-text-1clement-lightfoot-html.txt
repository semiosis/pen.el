<H1>CLEMENT OF ROME, First Epistle</H1>
<P>
<p>THE FIRST EPISTLE OF CLEMENT TO THE CORINTHIANS</p>

<p>Translated by J.B. Lightfoot. </p>

<p>1Clem prologue:1<br>
The Church of God which sojourneth in Rome to the Church of God which<br>
sojourneth in Corinth, to them which are called and sanctified by the<br>
will of God through our Lord Jesus Christ. Grace to you and peace<br>
from Almighty God through Jesus Christ be multiplied.</p>

<p>1Clem 1:1<br>
 By reason of the sudden and repeated calamities and reverses which<br>
are befalling us, brethren, we consider that we have been somewhat<br>
tardy in giving heed to the matters of dispute that have arisen among<br>
you, dearly beloved, and to the detestable and unholy sedition, so<br>
alien and strange to the elect of God, which a few headstrong and<br>
self-willed persons have kindled to such a pitch of madness that your<br>
name, once revered and renowned and lovely in the sight of all men,<br>
hath been greatly reviled.</p>

<p>1Clem 1:2<br>
For who that had sojourned among you did not approve your most<br>
virtuous and steadfast faith? Who did not admire your sober and<br>
forbearing piety in Christ? Who did not publish abroad your<br>
magnificent disposition of hospitality? Who did not congratulate you<br>
on your perfect and sound knowledge?</p>

<p>1Clem 1:3<br>
For ye did all things without respect of persons, and ye walked after<br>
the ordinances of God, submitting yourselves to your rulers and<br>
rendering to the older men among you the honor which is their due.<br>
On the young too ye enjoined modest and seemly thoughts: and the<br>
women ye charged to perform all their duties in a blameless and<br>
seemly and pure conscience, cherishing their own husbands, as is<br>
meet; and ye taught them to keep in the rule of obedience, and to<br>
manage the affairs of their household in seemliness, with all<br>
discretion.</p>

<p>1Clem 2:1<br>
 And ye were all lowly in mind and free from arrogance, yielding<br>
rather than claiming submission, <I>more glad to give than to<br>
receive</I>, and content with the provisions which God supplieth. And<br>
giving heed unto His words, ye laid them up diligently in your<br>
hearts, and His sufferings were before your eyes.</p>

<p>1Clem 2:2<br>
Thus a profound and rich peace was given to all, and an insatiable<br>
desire of doing good. An abundant outpouring also of the Holy Spirit<br>
fell upon all;</p>

<p>1Clem 2:3<br>
and, being full of holy counsel, in excellent zeal and with a pious<br>
confidence ye stretched out your hands to Almighty God, supplicating<br>
Him to be propitious, if unwillingly ye had committed any sin.</p>

<p>1Clem 2:4<br>
Ye had conflict day and night for all the brotherhood, that the<br>
number of His elect might be saved with fearfulness and intentness of<br>
mind.</p>

<p>1Clem 2:5<br>
Ye were sincere and simple and free from malice one towards another.</p>

<p>1Clem 2:6<br>
Every sedition and every schism was abominable to you. Ye mourned<br>
over the transgressions of your neighbors: ye judged their<br>
shortcomings to be your own.</p>

<p>1Clem 2:7<br>
Ye repented not of any well-doing, but were <I>ready unto every good<br>
work.</I></p>

<p>1Clem 2:8<br>
Being adorned with a most virtuous and honorable life, ye performed<br>
all your duties in the fear of Him. The commandments and the<br>
ordinances of the Lord were <I>written on the tablets of your hearts</I>.</p>

<p>1Clem 3:1<br>
 All glory and enlargement was given unto you, and that was fulfilled<br>
which is written <I>My beloved ate and drank and was enlarged and<br>
waxed fat and kicked.</I></p>

<p>1Clem 3:2<br>
Hence come jealousy and envy, strife and sedition, persecution and<br>
tumult, war and captivity.</p>

<p>1Clem 3:3<br>
So men were stirred up, <I>the mean against the honorable</I>, the ill<br>
reputed against the highly reputed, the foolish against the wise, the<br>
<I>young against the elder</I>.</p>

<p>1Clem 3:4<br>
For this cause <I>righteousness</I> and peace <I>stand aloof</I>, while each<br>
man hath forsaken the fear of the Lord and become purblind in the<br>
faith of Him, neither walketh in the ordinances of His commandments<br>
nor liveth according to that which becometh Christ, but each goeth<br>
after the lusts of his evil heart, seeing that they have conceived an<br>
unrighteous and ungodly jealousy, through which also <I>death entered<br>
into the world.</I></p>

<p>1Clem 4:1<br>
 For so it is written, <I>And it came to pass after certain days that<br>
Cain brought of the fruits of the earth a sacrifice unto God, and<br>
Abel he also brought of the firstlings of the sheep and of their<br>
</I>fatness.</p>

<p>1Clem 4:2<br>
<I>And God looked upon Abel and upon his gifts, but unto Cain and unto<br>
his sacrifices He gave no heed.</I></p>

<p>1Clem 4:3<br>
<I>And Cain sorrowed exceedingly, and his countenance fell.</I></p>

<p>1Clem 4:4<br>
<I>And God said unto Cain, Wherefore art thou very sorrowful and<br>
wherefore did thy countenance fall? If thou hast offered aright and<br>
hast not divided aright, didst thou not sin? Hold thy peace.</I></p>

<p>1Clem 4:5<br>
<I>Unto thee shall he turn, and thou shalt rule over him.</I> {This last<br>
phrase has also been translated: <I>Be at peace: thine offering<br>
returns to thyself, and thou shalt again possess it.</I>}</p>

<p>1Clem 4:6<br>
<I>And Cain said unto Abel his brother, Let us go over unto the plain.<br>
And it came to pass, while they Were in the plain, that Cain rose up<br>
against Abel his brother and slew him.</I></p>

<p>1Clem 4:7<br>
Ye see, brethren, jealousy and envy wrought a brother's murder.</p>

<p>1Clem 4:8<br>
By reason of jealousy our father Jacob ran away from the face of Esau<br>
his brother.</p>

<p>1Clem 4:9<br>
Jealousy caused Joseph to be persecuted even unto death, and to come<br>
even unto bondage.</p>

<p>1Clem 4:10<br>
Jealousy compelled Moses to flee from the face of Pharaoh king of<br>
Egypt while it was said to him by his own countryman, <I>Who made thee<br>
a judge or a decider over us, Wouldest thou slay me, even as<br>
yesterday thou slewest the Egyptian?</I></p>

<p>1Clem 4:11<br>
By reason of jealousy Aaron and Miriam were lodged outside the camp.</p>

<p>1Clem 4:12<br>
Jealousy brought Dathan and Abiram down alive to hades, because they<br>
made sedition against Moses the servant of God.</p>

<p>1Clem 4:13<br>
By reason of jealousy David was envied not only by the Philistines,<br>
but was persecuted also by Saul [king of Israel].</p>

<p>1Clem 5:1<br>
 But, to pass from the examples of ancient days, let us come to those<br>
champions who lived nearest to our time. Let us set before us the<br>
noble examples which belong to our generation.</p>

<p>1Clem 5:2<br>
By reason of jealousy and envy the greatest and most righteous<br>
pillars of the Church were persecuted, and contended even unto death.</p>

<p>1Clem 5:3<br>
Let us set before our eyes the good Apostles.</p>

<p>1Clem 5:4<br>
There was Peter who by reason of unrighteous jealousy endured not one<br>
not one but many labors, and thus having borne his testimony went to<br>
his appointed place of glory.</p>

<p>1Clem 5:5<br>
By reason of jealousy and strife Paul by his example pointed out the<br>
prize of patient endurance. After that he had been seven times in<br>
bonds, had been driven into exile, had been stoned, had preached in<br>
the East and in the West, he won the noble renown which was the<br>
reward of his faith,</p>

<p>1Clem 5:6<br>
having taught righteousness unto the whole world and having reached<br>
the farthest bounds of the West; and when he had borne his testimony<br>
before the rulers, so he departed from the world and went unto the<br>
holy place, having been found a notable pattern of patient endurance.</p>

<p>1Clem 6:1<br>
 Unto these men of holy lives was gathered a vast multitude of the<br>
elect, who through many indignities and tortures, being the victims<br>
of jealousy, set a brave example among ourselves.</p>

<p>1Clem 6:2<br>
By reason of jealousy women being persecuted, after that they had<br>
suffered cruel and unholy insults as Danaids and Dircae, safely<br>
reached the goal in the race of faith, and received a noble reward,<br>
feeble though they were in body.</p>

<p>1Clem 6:3<br>
Jealousy hath estranged wives from their husbands and changed the<br>
saying of our father Adam, <I>This now is bone of my bones and flesh<br>
of my flesh.</I></p>

<p>1Clem 6:4<br>
Jealousy and strife have overthrown great cities and uprooted great<br>
nations.</p>

<p>1Clem 7:1<br>
 These things, dearly beloved, we write, not only as admonishing you,<br>
but also as putting ourselves in remembrance. For we are in the same<br>
lists, and the same contest awaiteth us.</p>

<p>1Clem 7:2<br>
Wherefore let us forsake idle and vain thoughts; and let us conform<br>
to the glorious and venerable rule which hath been handed down to us;</p>

<p>1Clem 7:3<br>
and let us see what is good and what is pleasant and what is<br>
acceptable in the sight of Him that made us.</p>

<p>1Clem 7:4<br>
Let us fix our eyes on the blood of Christ and understand how<br>
precious it is unto His Father, because being shed for our salvation<br>
it won for the whole world the grace of repentance.</p>

<p>1Clem 7:5<br>
Let us review all the generations in turn, and learn how from<br>
generation to generation the Master hath given a place for repentance<br>
unto them that desire to turn to Him.</p>

<p>1Clem 7:6<br>
Noah preached repentance, and they that obeyed were saved.</p>

<p>1Clem 7:7<br>
Jonah preached destruction unto the men of Nineveh; but they,<br>
repenting of their sins, obtained pardon of God by their<br>
supplications and received salvation, albeit they were aliens from<br>
God.</p>

<p>1Clem 8:1<br>
 The ministers of the grace of God through the Holy Spirit spake<br>
concerning repentance.</p>

<p>1Clem 8:2<br>
Yea and the Master of the universe Himself spake concerning<br>
repentance with an oath:</p>

<p>1Clem 8:3<br>
<I>for, as I live saith the Lord, I desire not the death of the<br>
sinner, so much as his repentance,</I></p>

<p>1Clem 8:4<br>
and He added also a merciful judgment: <I>Repent ye, O house of<br>
Israel, of your iniquity; say unto the sons of My people, Though<br>
your sins reach from the earth even unto the heaven, and though<br>
they be redder than scarlet and blacker than sackcloth, and ye turn<br>
unto Me with your whole heart and say Father, I will give ear unto<br>
you as unto a holy people.</I></p>

<p>1Clem 8:5<br>
And in another place He saith on this wise, <I>Wash, be ye clean. Put<br>
away your iniquities from your souls out of My sight. Cease from<br>
your iniquities; learn to do good; seek out judgment; defend him<br>
that is wronged: give judgment for the orphan, and execute<br>
righteousness for the widow; and come and let us reason together,<br>
saith He; and though your sins be as crimson, I will make them<br>
white as snow; and though they be as scarlet, I will make them<br>
white as wool. And if ye be willing and will hearken unto Me, ye<br>
shall eat the good things of the earth; but if ye be not willing,<br>
neither hearken unto Me, a sword shall devour you; for the mouth of<br>
the Lord hath spoken these things</I>.</p>

<p>1Clem 8:6<br>
Seeing then that He desireth all His beloved to be partakers of<br>
repentance, He confirmed it by an act of His almighty will.</p>

<p>1Clem 9:1<br>
 Wherefore let us be obedient unto His excellent and glorious will;<br>
and presenting ourselves as suppliants of His mercy and goodness, let<br>
us fall down before Him and betake ourselves unto His compassions,<br>
forsaking the vain toil and the strife and the jealousy which leadeth<br>
unto death.</p>

<p>1Clem 9:2<br>
Let us fix our eyes on them that ministered perfectly unto His<br>
excellent glory.</p>

<p>1Clem 9:3<br>
Let us set before us Enoch, who being found righteous in obedience<br>
was translated, and his death was not found.</p>

<p>1Clem 9:4<br>
Noah, being found faithful, by his ministration preached regeneration<br>
unto the world, and through him the Master saved the living creatures<br>
that entered into the ark in concord.</p>

<p>1Clem 10:1<br>
 Abraham, who was called the 'friend,' was found faithful in that he<br>
rendered obedience unto the words of God.</p>

<p>1Clem 10:2<br>
He through obedience went forth from his land and from his kindred<br>
and from his father's house, that leaving a scanty land and a feeble<br>
kindred and a mean house he might inherit the promises of God.</p>

<p>1Clem 10:3<br>
For He saith unto him <I>Go forth from thy land and from thy kindred<br>
and from thy father's house unto the land which I shall show thee,<br>
and I will make thee into a great nation, and I will bless thee and<br>
will magnify thy name, and thou shalt be blessed. And I will bless<br>
them that bless thee, and I will curse them that curse thee; and in<br>
thee shall all the tribes of the earth be blessed.</I></p>

<p>1Clem 10:4<br>
And again, when he was parted from Lot, God said unto him <I>Look up<br>
with thine eyes, and behold from the place where thou now art, unto<br>
the north and the south and the sunrise and the sea; for all the<br>
land which thou seest, I will give it unto thee and to thy seed for<br>
ever;</I></p>

<p>1Clem 10:5<br>
<I>and I will make thy seed as the dust of the earth. If any man can<br>
count the dust of the earth, then shall thy seed also be counted.</I></p>

<p>1Clem 10:6<br>
And again He saith; <I>God led Abraham forth and said unto him, Look<br>
up unto the heaven and count the stars, and see whether thou canst<br>
number them. So shall thy seed be. And Abraham believed God, and it<br>
was reckoned unto him for righteousness.</I></p>

<p>1Clem 10:7<br>
For his faith and hospitality a son was given unto him in old age,<br>
and by obedience he offered him a sacrifice unto God on one of the<br>
mountains which He showed him.</p>

<p>1Clem 11:1<br>
 For his hospitality and godliness Lot was saved from Sodom, when all<br>
the country round about was judged by fire and brimstone; the Master<br>
having thus fore shown that He forsaketh not them which set their<br>
hope on Him, but appointeth unto punishment and torment them which<br>
swerve aside.</p>

<p>1Clem 11:2<br>
For when his wife had gone forth with him, being otherwise minded and<br>
not in accord, she was appointed for a sign hereunto, so that she<br>
became a pillar of salt unto this day, that it might be known unto<br>
all men that they which are double-minded and they which doubt<br>
concerning the power of God are set for a judgment and for a token<br>
unto all the generations.</p>

<p>1Clem 12:1<br>
 For her faith and hospitality Rahab the harlot was saved.</p>

<p>1Clem 12:2<br>
For when the spies were sent forth unto Jericho by Joshua the son of<br>
Nun, the king of the land perceived that they were come to spy out<br>
his country, and sent forth men to seize them, that being seized they<br>
might be put to death.</p>

<p>1Clem 12:3<br>
So the hospitable Rahab received them and hid them in the upper<br>
chamber under the flax stalks.</p>

<p>1Clem 12:4<br>
And when the messengers of the king came near and said, <I>The spies<br>
of our land entered in unto thee: bring them forth, for the king so<br>
ordereth:</I> then she answered, <I>The men truly, whom ye seek,<br>
entered in unto me, but they departed forthwith and are sojourning<br>
on the way;</I> and she pointed out to them the opposite road.</p>

<p>1Clem 12:5<br>
And she said unto the men, <I>Of a surety I perceive that the Lord<br>
your God delivereth this city unto you; for the fear and the dread<br>
of you is fallen upon the inhabitants thereof. When therefore it<br>
shall come to pass that ye take it, save me and the house of my<br>
father.</I></p>

<p>1Clem 12:6<br>
And they said unto her, <I>It shall be even so as thou hast spoken<br>
unto us. Whensoever therefore thou perceivest that we are coming,<br>
thou shalt gather all thy folk beneath thy roof and they shall be<br>
saved; for as many as shall be found without the house shall<br>
perish</I>.</p>

<p>1Clem 12:7<br>
And moreover they gave her a sign, that she should hang out from her<br>
house a scarlet thread, thereby showing beforehand that through the<br>
blood of the Lord there shall be redemption unto all them that<br>
believe and hope on God.</p>

<p>1Clem 12:8<br>
Ye see, dearly beloved, not only faith, but prophecy, is found in the<br>
woman.</p>

<p>1Clem 13:1<br>
 Let us therefore be lowly minded, brethren, laying aside all<br>
arrogance and conceit and folly and anger, and let us do that which<br>
is written. For the Holy Ghost saith, <I>Let not the wise man boast in<br>
his wisdom, nor the strong in his strength, neither the rich in his<br>
riches; but he that boasteth let him boast in the Lord, that he may<br>
seek Him out, and do judgment and righteousness</I> most of all<br>
remembering the words of the Lord Jesus which He spake, teaching<br>
forbearance and long-suffering:</p>

<p>1Clem 13:2<br>
for thus He spake <I>Have mercy, that ye may receive mercy: forgive,<br>
that it may be forgiven to you. As ye do, so shall it be done to<br>
you. As ye give, so shall it be given unto you. As ye judge, so<br>
shall ye be judged. As ye show kindness, so shall kindness be<br>
showed unto you. With what measure ye mete, it shall be measured<br>
withal to you.</I></p>

<p>1Clem 13:3<br>
With this commandment and these precepts let us confirm ourselves,<br>
that we may walk in obedience to His hallowed words, with lowliness<br>
of mind.</p>

<p>1Clem 13:4<br>
For the holy word saith, <I>Upon whom shall I look, save upon him that<br>
is gentle and quiet and feareth Mine oracles?</I></p>

<p>1Clem 14:1<br>
 Therefore it is right and proper, brethren, that we should be<br>
obedient unto God, rather than follow those who in arrogance and<br>
unruliness have set themselves up as leaders in abominable jealousy.</p>

<p>1Clem 14:2<br>
For we shall bring upon us no common harm, but rather great peril, if<br>
we surrender ourselves recklessly to the purposes of men who launch<br>
out into strife and seditions, so as to estrange us from that which<br>
is right.</p>

<p>1Clem 14:3<br>
Let us be good one towards another according to the compassion and<br>
sweetness of Him that made us. For it is written:</p>

<p>1Clem 14:4<br>
<I>The good shall be dwellers in the land, and the innocent shall be<br>
left on it but they that transgress shall be destroyed utterly from<br>
it.</I></p>

<p>1Clem 14:5<br>
And again He saith <I>I saw the ungodly lifted up on high and exalted<br>
as the cedars of Lebanon. And I passed by, and behold he was not;<br>
and sought out his place, and I found it not. Keep innocence and<br>
behold uprightness; for there is a remnant for the peaceful man.</I></p>

<p>1Clem 15:1<br>
 Therefore let us cleave unto them that practice peace with<br>
godliness, and not unto them that desire peace with dissimulation.</p>

<p>1Clem 15:2<br>
For He saith in a certain place <I>This people honoreth Me with their<br>
lips, but their heart is far from Me,</I></p>

<p>1Clem 15:3<br>
and again, <I>they blessed with their mouth, but they cursed with<br>
their heart.</I></p>

<p>1Clem 15:4<br>
And again He saith, <I>They loved Him with their mouth, and with their<br>
tongue they lied unto Him; and their heart was not upright with<br>
Him, neither were they steadfast in His covenant.</I></p>

<p>1Clem 15:5<br>
<I>For this cause let the deceitful lips be made dumb which speak<br>
iniquity against the righteous.</I> And again <I>May the Lord utterly<br>
destroy all the deceitful lips, the tongue that speaketh proud<br>
things, even them that say, Let us magnify our tongue; our lips are<br>
our own; who is lord over us?</I></p>

<p>1Clem 15:6<br>
<I>For the misery of the needy and for the groaning of the poor I will<br>
now arise, saith the Lord. I will set him in safety; I will deal<br>
boldly by him.</I></p>

<p>1Clem 16:1<br>
 For Christ is with them that are lowly of mind, not with them that<br>
exalt themselves over the flock.</p>

<p>1Clem 16:2<br>
The scepter of the majesty of God, even our Lord Jesus Christ, came<br>
not in the pomp of arrogance or of pride, though He might have done<br>
so, but in lowliness of mind, according as the Holy Spirit spake<br>
concerning Him.</p>

<p>1Clem 16:3<br>
For He saith <I>Lord, who believed our report? and to whom was the arm<br>
of the Lord revealed? We announced Him in His presence. As a child<br>
was He, as a root in a thirsty ground. There is no form in Him,<br>
neither glory. And we beheld Him, and He had no form nor<br>
comeliness, but His form was mean, lacking more than the form of<br>
men. He was a man of stripes and of toil, and knowing how to bear<br>
infirmity: for His face is turned away. He was dishonored and held<br>
of no account.</I></p>

<p>1Clem 16:4<br>
<I>He beareth our sins and suffereth pain for our sakes: and we<br>
accounted Him to be in toil and in stripes and in affliction.</I></p>

<p>1Clem 16:5<br>
<I>And He was wounded for our sins and hath been afflicted for our<br>
iniquities. The chastisement of our peace is upon Him. With His<br>
bruises we were healed.</I></p>

<p>1Clem 16:6<br>
<I>We all went astray like sheep, each man went astray in his own<br>
path:</I></p>

<p>1Clem 16:7<br>
<I>and the Lord delivered Him over for our sins. And He openeth not<br>
His mouth, because He is afflicted. As a sheep He was led to<br>
slaughter; and as a lamb before his shearer is dumb, so openeth He<br>
not His mouth. In His humiliation His judgment was taken away.</I></p>

<p>1Clem 16:8<br>
<I>His generation who shall declare? For His life is taken away from<br>
the earth.</I></p>

<p>1Clem 16:9<br>
<I>For the iniquities of my people He is come to death.</I></p>

<p>1Clem 16:10<br>
<I>And I will give the wicked for His burial, and the rich for His<br>
death; for He wrought no iniquity, neither was guile found in His<br>
mouth. And the Lord desireth to cleanse Him from His stripes.</I></p>

<p>1Clem 16:11<br>
<I>If ye offer for sin, your soul shall see along lived seed.</I></p>

<p>1Clem 16:12<br>
<I>And the Lord desireth to take away from the toil of His soul, to<br>
show Him light and to mould Him with understanding, to justify a<br>
Just One that is a good servant unto many. And He shall bear their<br>
sins.</I></p>

<p>1Clem 16:13<br>
<I>Therefore He shall inherit many, and shall divide the spoils of the<br>
strong; because His soul was delivered unto death, and He was<br>
reckoned unto the transgressors;</I></p>

<p>1Clem 16:14<br>
<I>and He bare the sins of many, and for their sins was He delivered<br>
up.</I></p>

<p>1Clem 16:15<br>
And again He Himself saith; <I>But I am a worm and no man, a reproach<br>
of men and an outcast of the people.</I></p>

<p>1Clem 16:16<br>
<I>All they that beheld me mocked at me; they spake with their lips;<br>
they wagged their heads, saying, He hoped on the Lord; let Him<br>
deliver him, or let Him save him, for He desireth him.</I></p>

<p>1Clem 16:17<br>
Ye see, dearly beloved, what is the pattern that hath been given unto<br>
us; for, if the Lord was thus lowly of mind, what should we do, who<br>
through Him have been brought under the yoke of His grace?</p>

<p>1Clem 17:1<br>
 Let us be imitators also of them which went about in goatskins and<br>
sheepskins, preaching the coming of Christ. We mean Elijah and Elisha<br>
and likewise Ezekiel, the prophets, and besides them those men also<br>
that obtained a good report.</p>

<p>1Clem 17:2<br>
Abraham obtained an exceeding good report and was called the friend<br>
of God; and looking steadfastly on the glory of God, he saith in<br>
lowliness of mind, <I>But I am dust and ashes.</I></p>

<p>1Clem 17:3<br>
Moreover concerning Job also it is thus written; <I>And Job was<br>
righteous and unblamable, one that was true and honored God and<br>
abstained from all evil</I>.</p>

<p>1Clem 17:4<br>
Yet he himself accuseth himself saying, <I>No man from filth; no, not<br>
though his life be but for a day.</I></p>

<p>1Clem 17:5<br>
Moses was called <I>faithful in all His house</I>, and through his<br>
ministration God judged Egypt with the plagues and the torments which<br>
befell them. Howbeit he also, though greatly glorified, yet spake no<br>
proud words, but said, when an oracle was given to him at the bush,<br>
<I>Who am I, that Thou sendest me?</I></p>

<p>1Clem 17:6<br>
<I>Nay, I am feeble of speech and slow of tongue.</I> And again he saith,<br>
<I>But I am smoke from the pot.</I></p>

<p>1Clem 18:1<br>
 But what must we say of David that obtained a good report? of whom<br>
God said, <I>I have found a man after My heart, David the son of<br>
Jesse: with eternal mercy have I anointed him.</I></p>

<p>1Clem 18:2<br>
Yet he too saith unto God <I>Have mercy upon me, O God, according to<br>
Thy great mercy; and according to the multitude of Thy compassions,<br>
blot out mine iniquity.</I></p>

<p>1Clem 18:3<br>
<I>Wash me yet more from mine iniquity, and cleanse me from my sin.<br>
For I acknowledge mine iniquity, and my sin is ever before me.<br>
Against Thee only did I sin, and I wrought evil in Thy sight; that<br>
Thou mayest be justified in Thy words, and mayest conquer in Thy<br>
pleading.</I></p>

<p>1Clem 18:4<br>
<I>For behold, in iniquities was I conceived, and in sins did my<br>
mother bear me. For behold Thou hast loved truth: the dark and<br>
hidden things of Thy wisdom hast Thou showed unto me.</I></p>

<p>1Clem 18:5<br>
<I>Thou shalt sprinkle me with hyssop, and I shall be made clean. Thou<br>
shalt wash me, and I shall become whiter than snow.</I></p>

<p>1Clem 18:6<br>
<I>Thou shalt make me to hear of joy and gladness. The bones which<br>
have been humbled shall rejoice.</I></p>

<p>1Clem 18:7<br>
<I>Turn away Thy face from my sins, and blot out all mine iniquities.</I></p>

<p>1Clem 18:8<br>
<I>Make a clean heart within me, O God, and renew a right spirit in<br>
mine inmost parts. Cast me not away from Thy presence, and take not<br>
Thy Holy Spirit from me.</I></p>

<p>1Clem 18:9<br>
<I>Restore unto me the joy of Thy salvation, and strengthen me with a<br>
princely spirit.</I></p>

<p>1Clem 18:10<br>
<I>I will teach sinners Thy ways, and godless men shall be converted<br>
unto Thee.</I></p>

<p>1Clem 18:11<br>
<I>Deliver me from blood guiltiness, O God, the God of my salvation.<br>
My tongue shall rejoice in Thy righteousness.</I></p>

<p>1Clem 18:12<br>
<I>Lord, Thou shalt open my mouth, and my lips shall declare Thy<br>
praise.</I></p>

<p>1Clem 18:13<br>
<I>For, if Thou hadst desired sacrifice, I would have given it: in<br>
whole burnt offerings Thou wilt have no pleasure.</I></p>

<p>1Clem 18:14<br>
<I>A sacrifice unto God is a contrite spirit; a contrite and humbled<br>
heart God will not despise.</I></p>

<p>1Clem 19:1<br>
 The humility therefore and the submissiveness of so many and so<br>
great men, who have thus obtained a good report, hath through<br>
obedience made better not only us but also the generations which were<br>
before us, even them that received His oracles in fear and truth.</p>

<p>1Clem 19:2<br>
Seeing then that we have been partakers of many great and glorious<br>
doings, let us hasten to return unto the goal of peace which hath<br>
been handed down to us from the beginning, and let us look<br>
steadfastly unto the Father and Maker of the whole world, and cleave<br>
unto His splendid and excellent gifts of peace and benefits.</p>

<p>1Clem 19:3<br>
Let us behold Him in our mind, and let us look with the eyes of our<br>
soul unto His long-suffering will. Let us note how free from anger He<br>
is towards all His creatures.</p>

<p>1Clem 20:1<br>
 The heavens are moved by His direction and obey Him in peace.</p>

<p>1Clem 20:2<br>
Day and night accomplish the course assigned to them by Him, without<br>
hindrance one to another.</p>

<p>1Clem 20:3<br>
The sun and the moon and the dancing stars according to His<br>
appointment circle in harmony within the bounds assigned to them,<br>
without any swerving aside.</p>

<p>1Clem 20:4<br>
The earth, bearing fruit in fulfillment of His will at her proper<br>
seasons, putteth forth the food that supplieth abundantly both men<br>
and beasts and all living things which are thereupon, making no<br>
dissension, neither altering anything which He hath decreed.</p>

<p>1Clem 20:5<br>
Moreover, the inscrutable depths of the abysses and the unutterable<br>
statutes of the nether regions are constrained by the same<br>
ordinances.</p>

<p>1Clem 20:6<br>
The basin of the boundless sea, gathered together by His workmanship<br>
<I>into it's reservoirs</I>, passeth not the barriers wherewith it is<br>
surrounded; but even as He ordered it, so it doeth.</p>

<p>1Clem 20:7<br>
For He said, <I>So far shalt thou come, and thy waves shall be broken<br>
within thee.</I></p>

<p>1Clem 20:8<br>
The ocean which is impassable for men, and the worlds beyond it, are<br>
directed by the same ordinances of the Master.</p>

<p>1Clem 20:9<br>
The seasons of spring and summer and autumn and winter give way in<br>
succession one to another in peace.</p>

<p>1Clem 20:10<br>
The winds in their several quarters at their proper season fulfill<br>
their ministry without disturbance; and the ever flowing fountains,<br>
created for enjoyment and health, without fail give their breasts<br>
which sustain the life for men. Yea, the smallest of living things<br>
come together in concord and peace.</p>

<p>1Clem 20:11<br>
All these things the great Creator and Master of the universe ordered<br>
to be in peace and concord, doing good unto all things, but far<br>
beyond the rest unto us who have taken refuge in His compassionate<br>
mercies through our Lord Jesus Christ,</p>

<p>1Clem 20:12<br>
to whom be the glory and the majesty for ever and ever. Amen.</p>

<p>1Clem 21:1<br>
 Look ye, brethren, lest His benefits, which are many, turn unto<br>
judgment to all of us, if we walk not worthily of Him, and do those<br>
things which are good and well pleasing in His sight with concord.</p>

<p>1Clem 21:2<br>
For He saith in a certain place, <I>The Spirit of the Lord is a lamp<br>
searching the closets of the belly</I>.</p>

<p>1Clem 21:3<br>
Let us see how near He is, and how that nothing escapeth Him of our<br>
thoughts or our devices which we make.</p>

<p>1Clem 21:4<br>
It is right therefore that we should not be deserters from His will.</p>

<p>1Clem 21:5<br>
Let us rather give offense to foolish and senseless men who exalt<br>
themselves and boast in the arrogance of their words, than to God.</p>

<p>1Clem 21:6<br>
Let us fear the Lord Jesus [Christ], whose blood was given for us.<br>
Let us reverence our rulers; let us honor our elders; let us instruct<br>
our young men in the lesson of the fear of God. Let us guide our<br>
women toward that which is good:</p>

<p>1Clem 21:7<br>
let them show forth their lovely disposition of purity; let them<br>
prove their sincere affection of gentleness; let them make manifest<br>
the moderation of their tongue through their silence; let them show<br>
their love, not in factious preferences but without partiality<br>
towards all them that fear God, in holiness. Let our children be<br>
partakers of the instruction which is in Christ:</p>

<p>1Clem 21:8<br>
let them learn how lowliness of mind prevaileth with God, what power<br>
chaste love hath with God, how the fear of Him is good and great and<br>
saveth all them that walk therein in a pure mind with holiness.</p>

<p>1Clem 21:9<br>
For He is the searcher out of the intents and desires; whose breath<br>
is in us, and when He listeth, He shall take it away.</p>

<p>1Clem 22:1<br>
 Now all these things the faith which is in Christ confirmeth: for He<br>
Himself through the Holy Spirit thus invite thus: <I>Come, my<br>
children, hearken unto Me, I will teach you the fear of the Lord.</I></p>

<p>1Clem 22:2<br>
<I>What man is he that desireth life and loveth to see good days?</I></p>

<p>1Clem 22:3<br>
<I>Make thy tongue to cease from evil, and thy lips that they speak no<br>
guile.</I></p>

<p>1Clem 22:4<br>
<I>Turn aside from evil and do good.</I></p>

<p>1Clem 22:5<br>
<I>Seek peace and ensue it.</I></p>

<p>1Clem 22:6<br>
<I>The eyes of the Lord are over the righteous, and His ears are<br>
turned to their prayers. But the face of the Lord is upon them that<br>
do evil, to destroy their memorial from the earth.</I></p>

<p>1Clem 22:7<br>
<I>The righteous cried out, and the Lord heard him, and delivered him<br>
from all his troubles. Many are the troubles of the righteous, and<br>
the Lord shall deliver him from them all</I>.</p>

<p>1Clem 22:8<br>
And again <I>Many are the stripes of the sinner, but them that set<br>
their hope on the Lord mercy shall compass about</I>.</p>

<p>1Clem 23:1<br>
 The Father, who is pitiful in all things, and ready to do good, hath<br>
compassion on them that fear Him, and kindly and lovingly bestoweth<br>
His favors on them that draw nigh unto Him with a single mind.</p>

<p>1Clem 23:2<br>
Therefore let us not be double-minded, neither let our soul indulge in<br>
idle humors respecting His exceeding and glorious gifts.</p>

<p>1Clem 23:3<br>
Let this scripture be far from us where He saith <I>Wretched are the<br>
double-minded, Which doubt in their soul and say, These things we<br>
did hear in the days of our fathers also, and behold we have grown<br>
old, and none of these things hath befallen us.</I></p>

<p>1Clem 23:4<br>
<I>Ye fools, compare yourselves unto a tree; take a vine. First it<br>
sheddeth its leaves, then a shoot cometh, then a leaf, then a<br>
flower, and after these a sour berry, then a full ripe grape</I>. Ye<br>
see that in a little time the fruit of the tree attaineth unto<br>
mellowness.</p>

<p>1Clem 23:5<br>
Of a truth quickly and suddenly shall His will be accomplished, the<br>
scripture also bearing witness to it, saying <I>He shall come quickly<br>
and shall not tarry; and the Lord shall come suddenly into His<br>
temple, even the Holy One, whom ye expect</I>.</p>

<p>1Clem 24:1<br>
 Let us understand, dearly beloved, how the Master continually<br>
showeth unto us the resurrection that shall be hereafter; whereof He<br>
made the Lord Jesus Christ the firstfruit, when He raised Him from<br>
the dead.</p>

<p>1Clem 24:2<br>
Let us behold, dearly beloved, the resurrection which happeneth at<br>
its proper season.</p>

<p>1Clem 24:3<br>
Day and night show unto us the resurrection. The night falleth<br>
asleep, and day ariseth; the day departeth, and night cometh on.</p>

<p>1Clem 24:4<br>
Let us mark the fruits, how and in what manner the sowing taketh<br>
place.</p>

<p>1Clem 24:5<br>
<I>The sower goeth forth</I> and casteth into the earth each of the<br>
seeds; and these falling into the earth dry and bare decay: then out<br>
of their decay the mightiness of the Master's providence raiseth them<br>
up, and from being one they increase manifold and bear fruit.</p>

<p>1Clem 25:1<br>
 Let us consider the marvelous sign which is seen in the regions of<br>
the east, that is, in the parts about Arabia.</p>

<p>1Clem 25:2<br>
There is a bird, which is named the phoenix. This, being the only<br>
one of its kind, liveth for five hundred years; and when it hath now<br>
reached the time of its dissolution that it should die, it maketh for<br>
itself a coffin of frankincense and myrrh and the other spices, into<br>
the which in the fullness of time it entereth, and so it dieth.</p>

<p>1Clem 25:3<br>
But, as the flesh rotteth, a certain worm is engendered, which is<br>
nurtured from the moisture of the dead creature and putteth forth<br>
wings. Then, when it is grown lusty, it taketh up that coffin where<br>
are the bones of its parent, and carrying them journeyeth from the<br>
country of Arabia even unto Egypt, to the place called the City of<br>
the Sun;</p>

<p>1Clem 25:4<br>
and in the daytime in the sight of all, flying to the altar of the<br>
Sun, it layeth them thereupon; and this done, it setteth forth to<br>
return.</p>

<p>1Clem 25:5<br>
So the priests examine the registers of the times, and they find that<br>
it hath come when the five hundredth year is completed.</p>

<p>1Clem 26:1<br>
 Do we then think it to be a great and marvelous thing, if the<br>
Creator of the universe shall bring about the resurrection of them<br>
that have served Him with holiness in the assurance of a good faith,<br>
seeing that He showeth to us even by a bird the magnificence of His<br>
promise?</p>

<p>1Clem 26:2<br>
For He saith in a certain place <I>And Thou shalt raise me up, and I<br>
will praise Thee;</I> and; <I>I went to rest and slept, I was awaked,<br>
for Thou art with me</I>.</p>

<p>1Clem 26:3<br>
And again Job saith <I>And Thou shall raise this my flesh which hath<br>
endured all these things</I>.</p>

<p>1Clem 27:1<br>
 With this hope therefore let our souls be bound unto Him that is<br>
faithful in His promises and that is righteous in His judgments.</p>

<p>1Clem 27:2<br>
He that commanded not to lie, much more shall He Himself not lie:<br>
for nothing is impossible with God save to lie.</p>

<p>1Clem 27:3<br>
Therefore let our faith in Him be kindled within us, and let us<br>
understand that all things are nigh unto Him.</p>

<p>1Clem 27:4<br>
By a word of His majesty He compacted the universe; and by a word He<br>
can destroy it.</p>

<p>1Clem 27:5<br>
<I>Who shall say unto Him, What hast thou done? or who shall resist<br>
the might of His strength?</I> When He listeth, and as He listeth, He<br>
will do all things; and nothing shall pass away of those things that<br>
He hath decreed.</p>

<p>1Clem 27:6<br>
All things are in His sight, and nothing escapeth His counsel,</p>

<p>1Clem 27:7<br>
seeing that <I>The heavens declare the glory of God, and the firmament<br>
proclaimeth His handiwork. Day uttereth word unto day, and night<br>
proclaimeth knowledge unto night; and there are neither words nor<br>
speeches, whose voices are not heard</I>.</p>

<p>1Clem 28:1<br>
 Since therefore all things are seen and heard, let us fear Him and<br>
forsake the abominable lusts of evil works, that we maybe shielded by<br>
His mercy from the coming judgments.</p>

<p>1Clem 28:2<br>
For where can any of us escape from His strong hand? And what world<br>
will receive any of them that desert from His service?</p>

<p>1Clem 28:3<br>
For the holy writing saith in a certain place <I>Where shall I go, and<br>
where shall I be hidden from Thy face? If I ascend into the heaven,<br>
Thou art there; if I depart into the farthest parts of the earth,<br>
there is Thy right hand; if I make my bed in the depths, there is<br>
Thy Spirit</I>.</p>

<p>1Clem 28:4<br>
Whither then shall one depart, or where shall one flee, from Him that<br>
embraceth the universe?</p>

<p>1Clem 29:1<br>
 Let us therefore approach Him in holiness of soul, lifting up pure<br>
and undefiled hands unto Him, with love towards our gentle and<br>
compassionate Father who made us an elect portion unto Himself.</p>

<p>1Clem 29:2<br>
For<br>
thus it is written: <I>When the Most High divided the nations, when He<br>
dispersed the sons of Adam, He fixed the boundaries of the nations<br>
according to the number of the angels of God. His people Jacob<br>
became the portion of the Lord, and Israel the measurement of His<br>
inheritance.</I></p>

<p>1Clem 29:3<br>
And in another place He saith, <I>Behold, the Lord taketh for Himself<br>
a nation out of the midst of the nations, as a man taketh the first<br>
fruits of his threshing floor; and the holy of holies shall come<br>
forth from that nation</I>.</p>

<p>1Clem 30:1<br>
 Seeing then that we are the special portion of a Holy God, let us do<br>
all things that pertain unto holiness, forsaking evil speakings,<br>
abominable and impure embraces, drunkennesses and tumults and hateful<br>
lusts, abominable adultery, hateful pride.</p>

<p>1Clem 30:2<br>
<I>For God</I>, He saith, <I>resisteth the proud, but giveth grace to the<br>
lowly.</I></p>

<p>1Clem 30:3<br>
Let us therefore cleave unto those to whom grace is given from God.<br>
Let us clothe ourselves in concord, being lowlyminded and temperate,<br>
holding ourselves aloof from all back biting and evil speaking, being<br>
justified by works and not by words.</p>

<p>1Clem 30:4<br>
For He saith, <I>He that saith much shall hear also again. Doth the<br>
ready talker think to be righteous?</I></p>

<p>1Clem 30:5<br>
<I>Blessed is the offspring of a woman that liveth but a short time.<br>
Be not thou abundant in words</I>.</p>

<p>1Clem 30:6<br>
Let our praise be with God, and not of ourselves: for God hateth<br>
them that praise themselves.</p>

<p>1Clem 30:7<br>
Let the testimony to our well doing be given by others, as it was<br>
given unto our fathers who were righteous.</p>

<p>1Clem 30:8<br>
Boldness and arrogance and daring are for them that are accursed of<br>
God; but forbearance and humility and gentleness are with them that<br>
are blessed of God.</p>

<p>1Clem 31:1<br>
 Let us therefore cleave unto His blessing, and let us see what are<br>
the ways of blessing. Let us study the records of the things that<br>
have happened from the beginning.</p>

<p>1Clem 31:2<br>
Wherefore was our father Abraham blessed? Was it not because he<br>
wrought righteousness and truth through faith?</p>

<p>1Clem 31:3<br>
Isaac with confidence, as knowing the future, was led a willing<br>
sacrifice.</p>

<p>1Clem 31:4<br>
Jacob with humility departed from his land because of his brother,<br>
and went unto Laban and served; and the twelve tribes of Israel were<br>
given unto him.</p>

<p>1Clem 32:1<br>
 If any man will consider them one by one in sincerity, he shall<br>
understand the magnificence of the gifts that are given by Him.</p>

<p>1Clem 32:2<br>
For of Jacob are all the priests and levites who minister unto the<br>
altar of God; of him is the Lord Jesus as concerning the flesh; of<br>
him are kings and rulers and governors in the line of Judah; yea and<br>
the rest of his tribes are held in no small honor, seeing that God<br>
promised saying, <I>Thy seed shall be as the stars of heaven</I>.</p>

<p>1Clem 32:3<br>
They all therefore were glorified and magnified, not through<br>
themselves or their own works or the righteous doing which they<br>
wrought, but through His will.</p>

<p>1Clem 32:4<br>
And so we, having been called through His will in Christ Jesus, are<br>
not justified through ourselves or through our own wisdom or<br>
understanding or piety or works which we wrought in holiness of<br>
heart, but through faith, whereby the Almighty God justified all men<br>
that have been from the beginning; to whom be the glory for ever and<br>
ever. Amen.</p>

<p>1Clem 33:1<br>
 What then must we do, brethren? Must we idly abstain from doing<br>
good, and forsake love? May the Master never allow this to befall us<br>
at least; but let us hasten with instancy and zeal to accomplish<br>
every good work.</p>

<p>1Clem 33:2<br>
For the Creator and Master of the universe Himself rejoiceth in His<br>
works.</p>

<p>1Clem 33:3<br>
For by His exceeding great might He established the heavens, and in<br>
His incomprehensible wisdom He set them in order. And the earth He<br>
separated from the water that surroundeth it, and He set it firm on<br>
the sure foundation of His own will; and the living creatures which<br>
walk upon it He commanded to exist by His ordinance. Having before<br>
created the sea and the living creatures therein, He enclosed it by<br>
His own power.</p>

<p>1Clem 33:4<br>
Above all, as the most excellent and exceeding great work of His<br>
intelligence, with His sacred and faultless hands He formed man in<br>
the impress of His own image.</p>

<p>1Clem 33:5<br>
For thus saith God <I>Let us make man after our image and after our<br>
likeness. And God made man; male and female made He them.</I></p>

<p>1Clem 33:6<br>
So having finished all these things, He praised them and blessed them<br>
and said, <I>Increase and multiply.</I></p>

<p>1Clem 33:7<br>
We have seen that all the righteous were adorned in good works. Yea,<br>
and the Lord Himself having adorned Himself with worlds rejoiced.</p>

<p>1Clem 33:8<br>
Seeing then that we have this pattern, let us conform ourselves with<br>
all diligence to His will; let us with all our strength work the work<br>
of righteousness.</p>

<p>1Clem 34:1<br>
 The good workman receiveth the bread of his work with boldness, but<br>
the slothful and careless dareth not look his employer in the face.</p>

<p>1Clem 34:2<br>
It is therefore needful that we should be zealous unto well doing,<br>
for of Him are all things:</p>

<p>1Clem 34:3<br>
since He forewarneth us saying, <I>Behold, the Lord, and His reward is<br>
before His face, to recompense each man according to his work.</I></p>

<p>1Clem 34:4<br>
He exhorteth us therefore to believe on Him with our whole heart, and<br>
to be not idle nor careless unto every good work.</p>

<p>1Clem 34:5<br>
Let our boast and our confidence be in Him: let us submit ourselves<br>
to His will; let us mark the whole host of His angels, how they stand<br>
by and minister unto His will.</p>

<p>1Clem 34:6<br>
For the scripture saith, <I>Ten thousands of ten thousands stood by<br>
Him, and thousands of thousands ministered unto Him: and they cried<br>
aloud, Holy, holy, holy is the Lord of Sabaoth; all creation is<br>
full of His glory</I>.</p>

<p>1Clem 34:7<br>
Yea, and let us ourselves then, being gathered together in concord<br>
with intentness of heart, cry unto Him as from one mouth earnestly<br>
that we may be made partakers of His great and glorious promises.</p>

<p>1Clem 34:8<br>
For He saith, <I>Eye hath not seen and ear hath not heard, and it hath<br>
not entered into the heart of man what great things He hath<br>
prepared for them that patiently await Him.</I></p>

<p>1Clem 35:1<br>
 How blessed and marvelous are the gifts of God, dearly beloved!!</p>

<p>1Clem 35:2<br>
Life in immortality, splendor in righteousness, truth in boldness,<br>
faith in confidence, temperance in sanctification! And all these<br>
things fall under our apprehension.</p>

<p>1Clem 35:3<br>
What then, think ye, are the things preparing for them that patiently<br>
await Him? The Creator and Father of the ages, the All holy One<br>
Himself knoweth their number and their beauty.</p>

<p>1Clem 35:4<br>
Let us therefore contend, that we may be found in the number of those<br>
that patiently await Him, to the end that we may be partakers of His<br>
promised gifts.</p>

<p>1Clem 35:5<br>
But how shall this be, dearly beloved? If our mind be fixed through<br>
faith towards God; if we seek out those things which are well<br>
pleasing and acceptable unto Him; if we accomplish such things as<br>
beseem His faultless will, and follow the way of truth, casting off<br>
from ourselves all unrighteousness and iniquity, covetousness,<br>
strifes, malignities and deceits, whisperings and backbitings, hatred<br>
of God, pride and arrogance, vainglory and inhospitality.</p>

<p>1Clem 35:6<br>
For they that do these things are hateful to God; and not only they<br>
that do them, but they also that consent unto them.</p>

<p>1Clem 35:7<br>
For the scripture saith, <I>But unto the sinner said God, Wherefore<br>
dost thou declare Mine ordinances, and takest My covenant upon thy<br>
lips?</I></p>

<p>1Clem 35:8<br>
<I>Yet Thou didst hate instruction and didst cast away My words behind<br>
thee. If thou sawest a thief thou didst keep company with him, and<br>
with the adulterers thou didst set thy portion. Thy mouth<br>
multiplied wickedness and thy tongue wove deceit. Thou sattest and<br>
spakest against thy brother, and against the son of thy mother thou<br>
didst lay a stumbling block.</I></p>

<p>1Clem 35:9<br>
<I>These things Thou hast done, and I kept silence. Thou thoughtest,<br>
unrighteous man, that I should be like unto thee.</I></p>

<p>1Clem 35:10<br>
<I>I will convict thee and will set thee face to face with thyself.</I></p>

<p>1Clem 35:11<br>
<I>Now understand ye these things, ye that forget God, lest at any<br>
time He seize you as a lion, and there be none to deliver.</I></p>

<p>1Clem 35:12<br>
<I>The sacrifice of praise shall glorify Me, and there is the way<br>
wherein I will show him the salvation of God</I>.</p>

<p>1Clem 36:1<br>
 This is the way, dearly beloved, wherein we found our salvation,<br>
even Jesus Christ the High priest of our offerings, the Guardian and<br>
Helper of our weakness.</p>

<p>1Clem 36:2<br>
Through Him let us look steadfastly unto the heights of the heavens;<br>
through Him we behold as in a mirror His faultless and most excellent<br>
visage; through Him the eyes of our hearts were opened; through Him<br>
our foolish and darkened mind springeth up unto the light; through<br>
Him the Master willed that we should taste of the immortal knowledge<br>
<I>Who being the brightness of His majesty is so much greater than<br>
angels, as He hath inherited a more excellent name.</I></p>

<p>1Clem 36:3<br>
For so it is written <I>Who maketh His angels spirits and His<br>
ministers aflame of fire</I></p>

<p>1Clem 36:4<br>
but of His Son the Master said thus, <I>Thou art My Son, I this day<br>
have begotten thee. Ask of Me, and I will give Thee the Gentiles<br>
for Thine inheritance, and the ends of the earth for Thy<br>
possession.</I></p>

<p>1Clem 36:5<br>
And again He saith unto Him <I>Sit Thou on My right hand, until I make<br>
Thine enemies a footstool for Thy feet.</I></p>

<p>1Clem 36:6<br>
Who then are these enemies? They that are wicked and resist His<br>
will.</p>

<p>1Clem 37:1<br>
 Let us therefore enlist ourselves, brethren, with all earnestness in<br>
His faultless ordinances.</p>

<p>1Clem 37:2<br>
Let us mark the soldiers that are enlisted under our rulers, how<br>
exactly, how readily, how submissively, they execute the orders given<br>
them.</p>

<p>1Clem 37:3<br>
All are not prefects, nor rulers of thousands, nor rulers of<br>
hundreds, nor rulers of fifties, and so forth; but each man in his<br>
own rank executeth the orders given by the king and the governors.</p>

<p>1Clem 37:4<br>
The great without the small cannot exist, neither the small without<br>
the great. There is a certain mixture in all things, and therein is<br>
utility.</p>

<p>1Clem 37:5<br>
Let us take our body as an example. The head without the feet is<br>
nothing; so likewise the feet without the head are nothing: even the<br>
smallest limbs of our body are necessary and useful for the whole<br>
body: but all the members conspire and unite in subjection, that the<br>
whole body maybe saved.</p>

<p>1Clem 38:1<br>
 So in our case let the whole body be saved in Christ Jesus, and let<br>
each man be subject unto his neighbor, according as also he was<br>
appointed with his special grace.</p>

<p>1Clem 38:2<br>
Let not the strong neglect the weak; and let the weak respect the<br>
strong. Let the rich minister aid to the poor; and let the poor give<br>
thanks to God, because He hath given him one through whom his wants<br>
may be supplied. Let the wise display his wisdom, not in words, but<br>
in good works. He that is lowly in mind, let him not bear testimony<br>
to himself, but leave testimony to be borne to him by his neighbor.<br>
He that is pure in the flesh, let him be so, and not boast, knowing<br>
that it is Another who bestoweth his continence upon him.</p>

<p>1Clem 38:3<br>
Let us consider, brethren, of what matter we were made; who and what<br>
manner of beings we were, when we came into the world; from what a<br>
sepulchre and what darkness He that molded and created us brought us<br>
into His world, having prepared His benefits aforehand ere ever we<br>
were born.</p>

<p>1Clem 38:4<br>
Seeing therefore that we have all these things from Him, we ought in<br>
all things to give thanks to Him, to whom be the glory for ever and<br>
ever. Amen.</p>

<p>1Clem 39:1<br>
 Senseless and stupid and foolish and ignorant men jeer and mock at<br>
us, desiring that they themselves should be exalted in their<br>
imaginations.</p>

<p>1Clem 39:2<br>
For what power hath a mortal? or what strength hath a child of earth?</p>

<p>1Clem 39:3<br>
For it is written; <I>There was no form before mine eyes; only I heard<br>
a breath and a voice.</I></p>

<p>1Clem 39:4<br>
<I>What then? Shall a mortal be clean in the sight of the Lord; or<br>
shall a man be unblamable for his works? seeing that He is<br>
distrustful against His servants and noteth some perversity against<br>
His angels.</I></p>

<p>1Clem 39:5<br>
<I>Nay, the heaven is not clean in His sight. Away then, ye that dwell<br>
in houses of clay, whereof, even of the same clay, we ourselves are<br>
made. He smote them like a moth, and from morn to even they are no<br>
more. Because they could not succor themselves, they perished.</I></p>

<p>1Clem 39:6<br>
<I>He breathed on them and they died, because they had no wisdom.</I></p>

<p>1Clem 39:7<br>
<I>But call thou, if perchance one shall obey thee, or if thou shalt<br>
see one of the holy angels. For wrath killeth the foolish man, and<br>
envy slayeth him that has gone astray.</I></p>

<p>1Clem 39:8<br>
<I>And I have seen fools throwing out roots, but forthwith their<br>
habitation was eaten up.</I></p>

<p>1Clem 39:9<br>
<I>Far be their sons from safety. May they be mocked at the gates of<br>
inferiors, and there shall be none to deliver them. For the things<br>
which are prepared for them, the righteous shall eat; but they<br>
themselves shall not be delivered from evils.</I></p>

<p>1Clem 40:1<br>
 Forasmuch then as these things are manifest beforehand, and we have<br>
searched into the depths of the Divine knowledge, we ought to do all<br>
things in order, as many as the Master hath commanded us to perform<br>
at their appointed seasons.</p>

<p>1Clem 40:2<br>
Now the offerings and ministrations He commanded to be performed with<br>
care, and not to be done rashly or in disorder, but at fixed times<br>
and seasons.</p>

<p>1Clem 40:3<br>
And where and by whom He would have them performed, He Himself fixed<br>
by His supreme will: that all things being done with piety according<br>
to His good pleasure might be acceptable to His will.</p>

<p>1Clem 40:4<br>
They therefore that make their offerings at the appointed seasons are<br>
acceptable and blessed: for while they follow the institutions of<br>
the Master they cannot go wrong.</p>

<p>1Clem 40:5<br>
For unto the high priest his proper services have been assigned, and<br>
to the priests their proper office is appointed, and upon the levites<br>
their proper ministrations are laid. The layman is bound by the<br>
layman's ordinances.</p>

<p>1Clem 41:1<br>
 Let each of you, brethren, in his own order give thanks unto God,<br>
maintaining a good conscience and not transgressing the appointed<br>
rule of his service, but acting with all seemliness.</p>

<p>1Clem 41:2<br>
Not in every place, brethren, are the continual daily sacrifices<br>
offered, or the freewill offerings, or the sin offerings and the<br>
trespass offerings, but in Jerusalem alone. And even there the<br>
offering is not made in every place, but before the sanctuary in the<br>
court of the altar; and this too through the high priest and the afore<br>
said ministers, after that the victim to be offered hath been<br>
inspected for blemishes.</p>

<p>1Clem 41:3<br>
They therefore who do any thing contrary to the seemly ordinance of<br>
His will receive death as the penalty.</p>

<p>1Clem 41:4<br>
Ye see, brethren, in proportion as greater knowledge hath been<br>
vouchsafed unto us, so much the more are we exposed to danger.</p>

<p>1Clem 42:1<br>
 The Apostles received the Gospel for us from the Lord Jesus<br>
Christ; Jesus Christ was sent forth from God.</p>

<p>1Clem 42:2<br>
So then Christ is from God, and the Apostles are from Christ. Both<br>
therefore came of the will of God in the appointed order.</p>

<p>1Clem 42:3<br>
Having therefore received a charge, and having been fully assured<br>
through the resurrection of our Lord Jesus Christ and confirmed in<br>
the word of God with full assurance of the Holy Ghost, they went<br>
forth with the glad tidings that the kingdom of God should come.</p>

<p>1Clem 42:4<br>
So preaching everywhere in country and town, they appointed their<br>
firstfruits, when they had proved them by the Spirit, to be bishops<br>
and deacons unto them that should believe.</p>

<p>1Clem 42:5<br>
And this they did in no new fashion; for indeed it had been written<br>
concerning bishops and deacons from very ancient times; for thus<br>
saith the scripture in a certain place, <I>I will appoint their<br>
bishops in righteousness and their deacons in faith.</I></p>

<p>1Clem 43:1<br>
 And what marvel, if they which were entrusted in Christ with such a<br>
work by God appointed the aforesaid persons? seeing that even the<br>
blessed Moses who was a <I>faithful servant in all His house</I> recorded<br>
for a sign in the sacred books all things that were enjoined upon<br>
him. And him also the rest of the prophets followed, bearing witness<br>
with him unto the laws that were ordained by him.</p>

<p>1Clem 43:2<br>
For he, when jealousy arose concerning the priesthood, and there was<br>
dissension among the tribes which of them was adorned with the<br>
glorious name, commanded the twelve chiefs of the tribes to bring to<br>
him rods inscribed with the name of each tribe. And he took them and<br>
tied them and sealed them with the signet rings of the chiefs of the<br>
tribes, and put them away in the tabernacle of the testimony on the<br>
table of God.</p>

<p>1Clem 43:3<br>
And having shut the tabernacle he sealed the keys and likewise also<br>
the doors.</p>

<p>1Clem 43:4<br>
And he said unto them, Brethren, the tribe whose rod shall bud, this<br>
hath God chosen to be priests and ministers unto Him.</p>

<p>1Clem 43:5<br>
Now when morning came, he called together all Israel, even the six<br>
hundred thousand men, and showed the seals to the chiefs of the<br>
tribes and opened the tabernacle of the testimony and drew forth the<br>
rods. And the rod of Aaron was found not only with buds, but also<br>
bearing fruit.</p>

<p>1Clem 43:6<br>
What think ye, dearly beloved? Did not Moses know beforehand that<br>
this would come to pass? Assuredly he knew it. But that disorder<br>
might not arise in Israel, he did thus, to the end that the Name of<br>
the true and only God might be glorified: to whom he the glory for<br>
ever and ever. Amen...</p>

<p>1Clem 44:1<br>
 And our Apostles knew through our Lord Jesus Christ that there would<br>
be strife over the name of the bishop's office.</p>

<p>1Clem 44:2<br>
For this cause therefore, having received complete foreknowledge,<br>
they appointed the aforesaid persons, and afterwards they provided a<br>
continuance, that if these should fall asleep, other approved men<br>
should succeed to their ministration. Those therefore who were<br>
appointed by them, or afterward by other men of repute with the<br>
consent of the whole Church, and have ministered unblamably to the<br>
flock of Christ in lowliness of mind, peacefully and with all<br>
modesty, and for long time have borne a good report with all these<br>
men we consider to be unjustly thrust out from their ministration.</p>

<p>1Clem 44:3<br>
For it will be no light sin for us, if we thrust out those who have<br>
offered the gifts of the bishop's office unblamably and holily.</p>

<p>1Clem 44:4<br>
Blessed are those presbyters who have gone before, seeing that their<br>
departure was fruitful and ripe: for they have no fear lest any one<br>
should remove them from their appointed place.</p>

<p>1Clem 44:5<br>
For we see that ye have displaced certain persons, though they were<br>
living honorably, from the ministration which had been respected by<br>
them blamelessly.</p>

<p>1Clem 45:1<br>
 Be ye contentious, brethren, and jealous about the things that<br>
pertain unto salvation.</p>

<p>1Clem 45:2<br>
Ye have searched the scriptures, which are true, which were given<br>
through the Holy Ghost;</p>

<p>1Clem 45:3<br>
and ye know that nothing unrighteous or counterfeit is written in<br>
them. Ye will not find that righteous persons have been thrust out<br>
by holy men.</p>

<p>1Clem 45:4<br>
Righteous men were persecuted, but it was by the lawless; they were<br>
imprisoned, but it was by the unholy. They were stoned by<br>
transgressors: they were slain by those who had conceived a<br>
detestable and unrighteous jealousy.</p>

<p>1Clem 45:5<br>
Suffering these things, they endured nobly.</p>

<p>1Clem 45:6<br>
For what must we say, brethren? Was Daniel cast into the lions' den<br>
by them that feared God?</p>

<p>1Clem 45:7<br>
Or were Ananias and Azarias and Misael shut up in the furnace of fire<br>
by them that professed the excellent and glorious worship of the Most<br>
High? Far be this from our thoughts. Who then were they that did<br>
these things? Abominable men and full of all wickedness were stirred<br>
up to such a pitch of wrath, as to bring cruel suffering upon them<br>
that served God in a holy and blameless purpose, not knowing that the<br>
Most High is the champion and protector of them that in a pure<br>
conscience serve His excellent Name: unto whom be the glory for ever<br>
and ever. Amen.</p>

<p>1Clem 45:8<br>
But they that endured patiently in confidence<br>
inherited glory and honor; they were exalted, and had their names<br>
recorded by God in their memorial for ever and ever. Amen.</p>

<p>1Clem 46:1<br>
 To such examples as these therefore, brethren, we also ought to<br>
cleave.</p>

<p>1Clem 46:2<br>
For it is written; <I>Cleave unto the saints, for they that cleave<br>
unto them shall be sanctified</I>.</p>

<p>1Clem 46:3<br>
And again He saith in another place; <I>With the guiltless man thou<br>
shalt be guiltless, and with the elect thou shalt be elect, and<br>
with the crooked thou shalt deal crookedly</I>.</p>

<p>1Clem 46:4<br>
Let us therefore cleave to the guiltless and righteous: and these<br>
are the elect of God.</p>

<p>1Clem 46:5<br>
Wherefore are there strifes and wraths and factions and divisions and<br>
war among you?</p>

<p>1Clem 46:6<br>
Have we not one God and one Christ and one Spirit of grace that was<br>
shed upon us? And is there not one calling in Christ?</p>

<p>1Clem 46:7<br>
Wherefore do we tear and rend asunder the members of Christ, and stir<br>
up factions against our own body, and reach such a pitch of folly, as<br>
to forget that we are members one of another?</p>

<p>1Clem 46:8<br>
Remember the words of Jesus our Lord: for He said, <I>Woe unto that<br>
man; it were good for him if he had not been born, rather than that<br>
at he should offend one of Mine elect. It were better for him that<br>
a millstone were hanged about him, and be cast into the sea, than<br>
that he should pervert one of Mine elect</I>.</p>

<p>1Clem 46:9<br>
Your division hath perverted many; it hath brought many to despair,<br>
many to doubting, and all of us to sorrow. And your sedition still<br>
continueth.</p>

<p>1Clem 47:1<br>
 Take up the epistle of the blessed Paul the Apostle.</p>

<p>1Clem 47:2<br>
What wrote he first unto you in the beginning of the Gospel?</p>

<p>1Clem 47:3<br>
Of a truth he charged you in the Spirit concerning himself and Cephas<br>
and Apollos, because that even then ye had made parties.</p>

<p>1Clem 47:4<br>
Yet that making of parties brought less sin upon you; for ye were<br>
partisans of Apostles that were highly reputed, and of a man approved<br>
in their sight.</p>

<p>1Clem 47:5<br>
But now mark ye, who they are that have perverted you and diminished<br>
the glory of your renowned love for the brotherhood.</p>

<p>1Clem 47:6<br>
It is shameful, dearly beloved, yes, utterly shameful and unworthy of<br>
your conduct in Christ, that it should be reported that the very<br>
steadfast and ancient Church of the Corinthians, for the sake of one<br>
or two persons, maketh sedition against its presbyters.</p>

<p>1Clem 47:7<br>
And this report hath reached not only us, but them also which differ<br>
from us, so that ye even heap blasphemies on the Name of the Lord by<br>
reason of your folly, and moreover create peril for yourselves.</p>

<p>1Clem 48:1<br>
 Let us therefore root this out quickly, and let us fall down before<br>
the Master and entreat Him with tears, that He may show Himself<br>
propitious and be reconciled unto us, and may restore us to the<br>
seemly and pure conduct which belongeth to our love of the brethren.</p>

<p>1Clem 48:2<br>
For this is a gate of righteousness opened unto life, as it is<br>
written; <I>Open me the gates of righteousness, that I may enter in<br>
thereby and preach the Lord.</I></p>

<p>1Clem 48:3<br>
<I>This is the gate of the Lord; the righteous shall enter in<br>
thereby</I>.</p>

<p>1Clem 48:4<br>
Seeing then that many gates are opened, this is that gate which is in<br>
righteousness, even that which is in Christ, whereby all are blessed<br>
that have entered in and direct their path in holiness and<br>
righteousness, performing all things without confusion.</p>

<p>1Clem 48:5<br>
Let a man be faithful, let him be able to expound a deep saying, let<br>
him be wise in the discernment of words, let him be strenuous in<br>
deeds, let him be pure;</p>

<p>1Clem 48:6<br>
for so much the more ought he to be lowly in mind, in proportion as<br>
he seemeth to be the greater; and he ought to seek the common<br>
advantage of all, and not his own.</p>

<p>1Clem 49:1<br>
 Let him that hath love in Christ fulfill the commandments of Christ.</p>

<p>1Clem 49:2<br>
Who can declare the bond of the love of God?</p>

<p>1Clem 49:3<br>
Who is sufficient to tell the majesty of its beauty?</p>

<p>1Clem 49:4<br>
The height, where unto love exalteth, is unspeakable.</p>

<p>1Clem 49:5<br>
Love joineth us unto God; <I>love covereth a multitude of sins;</I> love<br>
endureth all things, is long-suffering in all things. There is<br>
nothing coarse, nothing arrogant in love. Love hath no divisions,<br>
love maketh no seditions, love doeth all things in concord. In love<br>
were all the elect of God made perfect; without love nothing is well<br>
pleasing to God:</p>

<p>1Clem 49:6<br>
in love the Master took us unto Himself; for the<br>
love which He had toward us, Jesus Christ our Lord hath given His<br>
blood for us by the will of God, and His flesh for our flesh and His<br>
life for our lives.</p>

<p>1Clem 50:1<br>
 Ye see, dearly beloved, how great and marvelous a thing is love, and<br>
there is no declaring its perfection.</p>

<p>1Clem 50:2<br>
Who is sufficient to be found therein, save those to whom God shall<br>
vouchsafe it? Let us therefore entreat and ask of His mercy, that we<br>
may be found blameless in love, standing apart from the factiousness<br>
of men. All the generations from Adam unto this day have passed<br>
away: but they that by God's grace were perfected in love dwell in<br>
the abode of the pious; and they shall be made manifest in the<br>
visitation of the Kingdom of God.</p>

<p>1Clem 50:3<br>
For it is written; <I>Enter into the closet for a very little while<br>
until Mine anger and Mine wrath shall pass away, and I will<br>
remember a good day and will raise you from your tombs</I>.</p>

<p>1Clem 50:4<br>
Blessed were we, dearly beloved, if we should be doing the<br>
commandments of God in concord of love, to the end that our sins may<br>
through love be forgiven us.</p>

<p>1Clem 50:5<br>
For it is written; <I>Blessed are they whose iniquities are forgiven,<br>
and whose sins are covered. Blessed is the man to whom the Lord<br>
shall impute no sin, neither is guile in his mouth</I>.</p>

<p>1Clem 50:6<br>
This declaration of blessedness was pronounced upon them that have<br>
been elected by God through Jesus Christ our Lord, to whom be the<br>
glory for ever and ever. Amen.</p>

<p>1Clem 51:1<br>
 For all our transgressions which we have committed through any of<br>
the wiles of the adversary, let us entreat that we may obtain<br>
forgiveness. Yea and they also, who set themselves up as leaders of<br>
faction and division, ought to look to the common ground of hope.</p>

<p>1Clem 51:2<br>
For such as walk in fear and love desire that they themselves should<br>
fall into suffering rather than their neighbors; and they pronounce<br>
condemnation against themselves rather than against the harmony which<br>
hath been handed down to us nobly and righteously.</p>

<p>1Clem 51:3<br>
For it is good for a man to make confession of his trespasses rather<br>
than to harden his heart, as the heart of those was hardened who made<br>
sedition against Moses the servant of God; whose condemnation was<br>
clearly manifest,</p>

<p>1Clem 51:4<br>
for they went down to hades alive, and <I>Death shall be their<br>
shepherd</I>.</p>

<p>1Clem 51:5<br>
Pharaoh and his host and all the rulers of Egypt, <I>their chariots<br>
and their horsemen,</I> were overwhelmed in the depths of the Red Sea,<br>
and perished for none other reason but because their foolish hearts<br>
were hardened after that the signs and the wonders had been wrought<br>
in the land of Egypt by the hand of Moses the servant of God.</p>

<p>1Clem 52:1<br>
 The Master, brethren, hath need of nothing at all. He desireth not<br>
anything of any man, save to confess unto Him.</p>

<p>1Clem 52:2<br>
For the elect David saith; <I>I will confess unto the Lord, and it<br>
shall please Him more than a young calf that groweth horns and<br>
hoofs. Let the poor see it, and rejoice</I>.</p>

<p>1Clem 52:3<br>
And again He saith; <I>Sacrifice to God a sacrifice of praise, and pay<br>
thy vows to the Most High: and call upon Me in the day of thine<br>
affliction, and I will deliver thee, and thou shalt glorify Me.<br>
</I><br>
1Clem 52:4<br>
<I>For a sacrifice unto God is a broken spirit.</I></p>

<p>1Clem 53:1<br>
 For ye know, and know well, the sacred scriptures, dearly beloved,<br>
and ye have searched into the oracles of God. We write these things<br>
therefore to put you in remembrance.</p>

<p>1Clem 53:2<br>
When Moses went up into the mountain and had spent forty days and<br>
forty nights in fasting and humiliation, God said unto him; <I>Moses,<br>
Moses, come down , quickly hence, for My people whom thou leadest<br>
forth from the land of Egypt have wrought iniquity: they have<br>
transgressed quickly out of the way which thou didst command unto<br>
them: they have made for themselves molten images.<br>
</I><br>
1Clem 53:3<br>
<I>And the Lord said unto him; I have spoken unto thee once and twice,<br>
saying, I have seen this people, and behold it is stiff-necked. Let<br>
Me destroy them utterly, and I will blot out their name from under<br>
heaven, and I will make of thee a nation great and wonderful and<br>
numerous more than this</I>.</p>

<p>1Clem 53:4<br>
And Moses said; <I>Nay, not so, Lord Forgive this people their sin, or<br>
blot me also out of the book of the living</I>.</p>

<p>1Clem 53:5<br>
O mighty love! O unsurpassable perfection! The servant is bold with<br>
his Master; he asketh forgiveness for the multitude, or he demandeth<br>
that himself also be blotted out with them.</p>

<p>1Clem 54:1<br>
 Who therefore is noble among you? Who is compassionate? Who is<br>
fulfilled with love?</p>

<p>1Clem 54:2<br>
Let him say; If by reason of me there be faction and strife and<br>
divisions, I retire, I depart, whither ye will, and I do that which<br>
is ordered by the people: only let the flock of Christ be at peace<br>
with its duly appointed presbyters.</p>

<p>1Clem 54:3<br>
He that shall have done this, shall win for himself great renown in<br>
Christ, and every place will receive him: for <I>the earth is the<br>
Lord's and the fullness thereof</I>.</p>

<p>1Clem 54:4<br>
Thus have they done and will do, that live as citizens of that<br>
kingdom of God which bringeth no regrets.</p>

<p>1Clem 55:1<br>
 But, to bring forward examples of Gentiles also; many kings and<br>
rulers, when some season of pestilence pressed upon them, being<br>
taught by oracles have delivered themselves over to death, that they<br>
might rescue their fellow citizens through their own blood. Many<br>
have retired from their own cities, that they might have no more<br>
seditions.</p>

<p>1Clem 55:2<br>
We know that many among ourselves have delivered themselves to<br>
bondage, that they might ransom others. Many have sold themselves to<br>
slavery, and receiving the price paid for themselves have fed others.</p>

<p>1Clem 55:3<br>
Many women being strengthened through the grace of God have<br>
performed many manly deeds.</p>

<p>1Clem 55:4<br>
The blessed Judith, when the city was beleaguered, asked of the<br>
elders that she might be suffered to go forth into the camp of the<br>
aliens.</p>

<p>1Clem 55:5<br>
So she exposed herself to peril and went forth for love of her<br>
country and of her people which were beleaguered; and the Lord<br>
delivered Holophernes into the hand of a woman.</p>

<p>1Clem 55:6<br>
To no less peril did Esther also, who was perfect in faith, expose<br>
herself, that she might deliver the twelve tribes of Israel, when<br>
they were on the point to perish. For through her fasting and her<br>
humiliation she entreated the all seeing Master, the God of the<br>
ages; and He, seeing the humility of her soul, delivered the people<br>
for whose sake she encountered the peril.</p>

<p>1Clem 56:1<br>
 Therefore let us also make intercession for them that are in any<br>
transgression, that forbearance and humility may be given them, to<br>
the end that they may yield not unto us, but unto the will of God.<br>
For so shall the compassionate remembrance of them with God and the<br>
saints be fruitful unto them, and perfect.</p>

<p>1Clem 56:2<br>
Let us accept chastisement, whereat no man ought to be vexed, dearly<br>
beloved. The admonition which we give one to another is good and<br>
exceeding useful; for it joineth us unto the will of God.</p>

<p>1Clem 56:3<br>
For thus saith the holy word; <I>The Lord hath indeed chastened me,<br>
and hath not delivered me over unto death.</I></p>

<p>1Clem 56:4<br>
<I>For whom the Lord loveth He chasteneth, and scourgeth every son<br>
whom He receiveth.</I></p>

<p>1Clem 56:5<br>
<I>For the righteous,</I> it is said, <I>shall chasten me in mercy and<br>
shall reprove me, but let not the mercy of sinners anoint my head</I>.</p>

<p>1Clem 56:6<br>
And again He saith; <I>Blessed is the man whom the Lord hath reproved,<br>
and refuse not thou the admonition of the Almighty. For He causeth<br>
pain, and he restoreth again:</I></p>

<p>1Clem 56:7<br>
<I>He hath smitten, and His hands have healed.</I></p>

<p>1Clem 56:8<br>
<I>Six times shall He rescue thee from afflictions and at the seventh<br>
no evil shall touch thee.</I></p>

<p>1Clem 56:9<br>
<I>In famine he shall deliver thee from death, and in war He shall<br>
release thee from the arm of the sword.</I></p>

<p>1Clem 56:10<br>
<I>And from the scourge of the tongue He shall hide thee and thou<br>
shalt not be afraid when evils approach.</I></p>

<p>1Clem 56:11<br>
<I>Thou shalt laugh at the unrighteous and wicked, and of the wild<br>
beasts thou shalt not be afraid.</I></p>

<p>1Clem 56:12<br>
<I>For wild beasts shall be at peace with thee.</I></p>

<p>1Clem 56:13<br>
<I>Then shalt thou know that thy house shall be at peace: and the<br>
abode of thy tabernacle shall not go wrong,</I></p>

<p>1Clem 56:14<br>
<I>and thou shalt know that thy seed is many, and thy children as the<br>
plenteous herbage of the field.</I></p>

<p>1Clem 56:15<br>
<I>And thou shalt come to the grave as ripe corn reaped in due season,<br>
or as the heap of the threshing floor gathered together at the<br>
right time.</I></p>

<p>1Clem 56:16<br>
Ye see, dearly beloved, how great protection there is for them that<br>
are chastened by the Master: for being a kind father He chasteneth<br>
us to the end that we may obtain mercy through His holy chastisement.</p>

<p>1Clem 57:1<br>
 Ye therefore that laid the foundation of the sedition, submit<br>
yourselves unto the presbyters and receive chastisement unto<br>
repentance, bending the knees of your heart.</p>

<p>1Clem 57:2<br>
Learn to submit yourselves, laying aside the arrogant and proud<br>
stubbornness of your tongue. For it is better for you to be found<br>
little in the flock of Christ and to have your name on God's roll,<br>
than to be had in exceeding honor and yet be cast out from the hope<br>
of Him.</p>

<p>1Clem 57:3<br>
For thus saith the All virtuous Wisdom; <I>Behold I will pour out for<br>
you a saying of My breath, and I will teach you My word.</I></p>

<p>1Clem 57:4<br>
<I>Because I called and ye obeyed not, and I held out words and ye<br>
heeded not, but made My councils of none effect, and were<br>
disobedient unto My reproofs; therefore I also will laugh at your<br>
destruction, and will rejoice over you when ruin cometh upon you,<br>
and when confusion overtaketh you suddenly, and your overthrow is<br>
at hand like a whirlwind,</I></p>

<p>1Clem 57:5<br>
<I>or when ye call upon Me, yet will I not here you. Evil men shall<br>
seek me and not find me: for they hated wisdom, and chose not the<br>
fear of the Lord, neither would they give head unto My councils,<br>
but mocked at My reproofs.</I></p>

<p>1Clem 57:6<br>
<I>Therefore they shall eat the fruits of their own way, and shall be<br>
filled with their own ungodliness.</I></p>

<p>1Clem 57:7<br>
<I>For because they wronged babes, they shall be slain, and<br>
inquisition shall destroy the ungodly. But he that heareth Me shall<br>
dwell safely trusting in hope, and shall be quiet from all fear of<br>
all evil.</I></p>

<p>1Clem 58:1<br>
 Let us therefore be obedient unto His most holy and glorious Name,<br>
thereby escaping the threatenings which were spoken of old by the<br>
mouth of Wisdom against them which disobey, that we may dwell safely,<br>
trusting in the most holy Name of His majesty.</p>

<p>1Clem 58:2<br>
Receive our counsel, and ye shall have no occasion of regret. For as<br>
God liveth, and the Lord Jesus Christ liveth, and the Holy Spirit,<br>
who are the faith and the hope of the elect, so surely shall he, who<br>
with lowliness of mind and instant in gentleness hath without<br>
regretfulness performed the ordinances and commandments that are<br>
given by God, be enrolled and have a name among the number of them<br>
that are saved through Jesus Christ, through whom is the glory unto<br>
Him for ever and ever. Amen.</p>

<p>1Clem 59:1<br>
 But if certain persons should be disobedient unto the words spoken<br>
by Him through us, let them understand that they will entangle<br>
themselves in no slight transgression and danger;</p>

<p>1Clem 59:2<br>
but we shall be guiltless of this sin. And we will ask, with<br>
instancy of prayer and supplication, that the Creator of the universe<br>
may guard intact unto the end the number that hath been numbered of<br>
His elect throughout the whole world, through His beloved Son Jesus<br>
Christ, through whom He called us from darkness to light, from<br>
ignorance to the full knowledge of the glory of His Name.</p>

<p>1Clem 59:3<br>
 [Grant unto us, Lord,] that we may set our hope on Thy Name which is<br>
the primal source of all creation, and open the eyes of our hearts,<br>
that we may know Thee, who alone abidest <I>Highest in the lofty, Holy<br>
in the holy;</I> who <I>layest low in the insolence of the proud,</I> who<br>
<I>settest the lowly on high</I>, and <I>bringest the lofty low;</I> who<br>
<I>makest rich and makest poor;</I> who <I>killest and makest alive;</I> who<br>
alone art the Benefactor of spirits and the God of all flesh; who<br>
<I>lookest into the abysses</I>, who scanest the works of man; the Succor<br>
of them that are in peril, the <I>Savior of them that are in <br>
despair</I>; The Creator and Overseer of every spirit; who multipliest<br>
the nations upon earth, and hast chosen out from all men those that<br>
love Thee through Jesus Christ, Thy beloved Son, through whom Thou<br>
didst instruct us, didst sanctify us, didst honor us.</p>

<p>1Clem 59:4<br>
We beseech Thee, Lord and Master, to be <I>our help and succor</I>. Save<br>
those among us who are in tribulation; have mercy on the lowly; lift<br>
up the fallen; show Thyself unto the needy; heal the ungodly; convert<br>
the wanderers of Thy people; feed the hungry; release our prisoners;<br>
raise up the weak; comfort the fainthearted. <I>Let all the Gentiles<br>
know that Thou art the God alone</I>, and Jesus Christ is Thy Son, and<br>
<I>we are Thy people and the sheep of Thy pasture.</I></p>

<p>1Clem 60:1<br>
 Thou through Thine operations didst make manifest the everlasting<br>
fabric of the world. Thou, Lord, didst create the earth. Thou that<br>
art faithful throughout all generations, righteous in Thy judgments,<br>
marvelous in strength and excellence, Thou that art wise in creating<br>
and prudent in establishing that which Thou hast made, that art good<br>
in the things which are seen and faithful with them that trust on<br>
Thee, <I>pitiful and compassionate</I>, forgive us our iniquities and our<br>
unrighteousnesses and our transgressions and shortcomings.</p>

<p>1Clem 60:2<br>
Lay not to our account every sin of Thy servants and Thine handmaids,<br>
but cleanse us with the cleansing of Thy truth, and <I>guide our steps<br>
to walk in holiness</I> and righteousness and singleness <I>of heart</I><br>
and <I>to do such things as are good and well pleasing in Thy sight</I><br>
and in the sight of our rulers.</p>

<p>1Clem 60:3<br>
Yea, Lord, <I>make Thy face to shine upon us</I> in peace for our good,<br>
that we may be sheltered <I>by Thy mighty hand and</I> delivered from<br>
every sin <I>by Thine uplifted arm.</I> And deliver us from them that<br>
hate us wrongfully.</p>

<p>1Clem 60:4<br>
Give concord and peace to us and to all that dwell on the earth, as<br>
Thou gavest to our fathers, <I>when they called on</I> Thee <I>in faith<br>
and truth</I> with holiness, [that we may be saved,] while we render<br>
obedience to Thine almighty and most excellent Name, and to our<br>
rulers and governors upon the earth.</p>

<p>1Clem 61:1<br>
 Thou, Lord and Master, hast given them the power of sovereignty<br>
through Thine excellent and unspeakable might, that we knowing the<br>
glory and honor which Thou hast given them may submit ourselves unto<br>
them, in nothing resisting Thy will. Grant unto them therefore, O<br>
Lord, health peace, concord, stability, that they may administer the<br>
government which Thou hast given them without failure.</p>

<p>1Clem 61:2<br>
For Thou, O heavenly Master, King of the ages, givest to the sons of<br>
men glory and honor and power over all things that are upon the<br>
earth. Do Thou, Lord, direct their counsel according to that which<br>
is good and well pleasing in Thy sight, that, administering in peace<br>
and gentleness with Godliness the power which Thou hast given them,<br>
they may obtain Thy favor.</p>

<p>1Clem 61:3<br>
O Thou, who alone art able to do these things and things far more<br>
exceeding good than these for us, we praise Thee through the High<br>
priest and Guardian of our souls, Jesus Christ, through whom be the<br>
glory and the majesty unto Thee both now and for all generations and<br>
for ever and ever. Amen.</p>

<p>1Clem 62:1<br>
 As touching those things which befit our religion and are most<br>
useful for a virtuous life to such as would guide [their steps] in<br>
holiness and righteousness, we have written fully unto you, brethren.</p>

<p>1Clem 62:2<br>
For concerning faith and repentance and genuine love and temperance<br>
and sobriety and patience we have handled every argument, putting you<br>
in remembrance, that ye ought to please Almighty God in righteousness<br>
and truth and long suffering with holiness, laying aside malice and<br>
pursuing concord in love and peace, being instant in gentleness; even<br>
as our fathers, of whom we spake before, pleased Him, being lowly<br>
minded toward their Father and God and Creator and towards all men.</p>

<p>1Clem 62:3<br>
And we have put you in mind of these things the more gladly, since we<br>
knew well that we were writing to men who are faithful and highly<br>
accounted and have diligently searched into the oracles of the<br>
teaching of God.</p>

<p>1Clem 63:1<br>
 Therefore it is right for us to give heed to so great and so many<br>
examples and to submit the neck and occupying the place of obedience<br>
to take our side with them that are the leaders of our souls, that<br>
ceasing from this foolish dissension we may attain unto the goal<br>
which lieth before us in truthfulness, keeping aloof from every<br>
fault.</p>

<p>1Clem 63:2<br>
For ye will give us great joy and gladness, if ye render obedience<br>
unto the things written by us through the Holy Spirit, and root out<br>
the unrighteous anger of your jealousy, according to the entreaty<br>
which we have made for peace and concord in this letter.</p>

<p>1Clem 63:3<br>
And we have also sent faithful and prudent men that have walked among<br>
us from youth unto old age unblamably, who shall also be witnesses<br>
between you and us.</p>

<p>1Clem 63:4<br>
And this we have done that ye might know that we have had, and still<br>
have, every solicitude that ye should be speedily at peace.</p>

<p>1Clem 64:1<br>
 Finally may the All seeing God and Master of spirits and Lord of all<br>
flesh, who chose the Lord Jesus Christ, and us through Him for a<br>
peculiar people, grant unto every soul that is called after His<br>
excellent and holy Name faith, fear, peace, patience, long-suffering,<br>
temperance, chastity and soberness, that they may be well pleasing<br>
unto His Name through our High priest and Guardian Jesus Christ,<br>
through whom unto Him be glory and majesty, might and honor, both now<br>
and for ever and ever. Amen.</p>

<p>1Clem 65:1<br>
 Now send ye back speedily unto us our messengers Claudius Ephebus<br>
and Valerius Bito, together with Fortunatus also, in peace and with<br>
joy, to the end that they may the more quickly report the peace and<br>
concord which is prayed for and earnestly desired by us, that we also<br>
may the more speedily rejoice over your good order.</p>

<p>1Clem 65:2<br>
 The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you and with all men in<br>
all places who have been called by God and through Him, through whom<br>
be glory and honor, power and greatness and eternal dominion, unto<br>
Him, from the ages past and forever and ever. Amen.</p>
