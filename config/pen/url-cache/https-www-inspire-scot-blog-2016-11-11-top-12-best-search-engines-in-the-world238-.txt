People are now becoming more and more dependent on search engines to get the answer for their everyday queries.<br />
<br />
At Inspire we monitor our search traffic using a variety of analytics. Most of our queries returned are related to what we do and some are simply bizarre. Those we&rsquo;re interested in relate to the services of what we do e.g improving search ranking, web design, web development, and many more.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Much as we utilise &ldquo;all routes to market&rdquo; we are still heavily dependent on the search engines for our bread &amp; butter traffic.<br />
<br />
Recently we did a piece of work for a client looking to reach into the Russian market, they&rsquo;d spoken to other firms who all shared about what they&rsquo;d do on Google and how such experts they are. This completely missed the point as Google are not the dominant search engine in Russia, Yandex is!!!<br />
<br />
This brought it home to me that perhaps people have assumed that because Google is a dominant Global player that they are also the dominant player in every market.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
For that reason we thought it would be worthwhile having a run down on the rest of the World, so let&rsquo;s look at top 12&nbsp;search engines in the world.</p>

<h2>List of Top 12&nbsp;Best Search Engines in The World</h2>

<p><strong>1. <a href=\"http://www.google.com\" target=\"_blank\">Google</a>&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.google.co.uk\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"search engine optimisation - Perth - Scotland\" src=\"/desktop/web/ckfinder/userfiles/images/googles-new-logo.gif\" style=\"float:right; height:91px; width:200px\" /></a></strong><br />
Google Search Engine is the best search engine in the world and it is also one of most popular products from Google. Almost 70 percent of the Search Engine market has been acquired by Google. The tech giant is always evolving and looking to improve the search engine algorithm to provide best results to the end-user. Although Google appears to be the biggest search engine, as of 2015 YouTube is now more popular than Google (on desktop computers).<br />
<strong>GIVE IT&nbsp;A GO:&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/search-google-com-Google-Search/dp/B00SZDLGSO/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=google+search&amp;qid=1646667395&amp;sprefix=google+sear%2Caps%2C419&amp;sr=8-1\" rel=\"sponsored\" target=\"_blank\">Google Search App</a><br />
<br />
<strong>2. <a href=\"http://bing.com\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"SEO | Web Design | Perth\">Bing</a> &nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.bing.com\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"SEO | Perth | Web Design | Bing | PPC \" src=\"/desktop/web/ckfinder/userfiles/images/inspire%20it%20services%20-%20SEO.png\" style=\"float:right; height:91px; width:200px\" title=\"SEO | Perth | Web Design | Bing | PPC \" /></a></strong><br />
Bing is Microsoft&rsquo;s answer to Google and it was launched in 2009. Bing is the default search engine in Microsoft&rsquo;s web browser. At Bing, they are always striving to make it a better search engine but it&rsquo;s got a long way to go to give Google competition. Microsoft&rsquo;s search engine provides different services including image, web and video search along with maps. Bing introduced Places (Google&rsquo;s equivalent is Google My Business), this is a great platform for business to submit their details to optimise their search results.<br />
<strong>GIVE IT&nbsp;A GO:&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004T54Y2M/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B004T54Y2M&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=afftim0d-20&amp;linkId=427c60280a7aee14d1e62549c555bb83\" rel=\"sponsored\" target=\"_blank\">Bing Search App</a><br />
<br />
<strong>3. <a href=\"http://yahoo.co.uk\" target=\"_blank\">Yahoo</a>&nbsp;<a href=\"http://yahoo.co.uk\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"yahoo | SEO | Perth | Scotland \" src=\"/desktop/web/ckfinder/userfiles/images/yahoo.png\" style=\"float:right; height:91px; width:200px\" title=\"yahoo | SEO | Perth | Scotland \" /></a></strong><br />
Yahoo &amp; Bing compete more with each other than with Google. A recent report on netmarketshare.com tells us that Yahoo have a market share of 7.68 percent. Although a leader as a free email provider, this is declining significantly though with their recent acknowledgement that User Details &amp; Passwords where hacked last year.<br />
<strong>GIVE IT A GO:&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B014X5UGPQ/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B014X5UGPQ&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=afftim0d-20&amp;linkId=afc38fc0f331625179d81a7b859afea0\" rel=\"sponsored\" target=\"_blank\">Yahoo Search App</a><br />

<strong>4. &nbsp;<a href=\"http://baidu.com\">Baidu</a> &nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.baidu.com\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"Baidu - SEO - Perth - PPC\" src=\"/desktop/web/ckfinder/userfiles/images/Baidu%20-%20SEO%20-%20Perth%20-%20PPC.jpg\" style=\"float:right; height:91px; width:200px\" title=\"Baidu - SEO - Perth - PPC\" /></a></strong><br />
Baidu is the most used search engine in China and was founded in Jan, 2000 by Chinese Entrepreneur, Eric Xu. This web search is made to deliver results for website, audio files and images. It provides some other services including maps, news, cloud storage and much more.<br />

<strong>5. <a href=\"http://aol.co.uk\">AOL</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<img alt=\"\" src=\"/desktop/web/ckfinder/userfiles/images/aol.jpg\" style=\"float:right; height:91px; width:200px\" /></strong><br />
Aol.com is also among the top search engines. These are the guys that used to send out CD&rsquo;s which you&rsquo;d load onto your PC to install their browser and modem software. Once the pre-eminent player they now have a market share of 0.59 percent. Verizon Communication bought AOL for $4.4 billion. It was started back in 1983 as Control Video Corporation. It was named America Online in 1991 and in 2009 as AOL Inc. AOL is a global mass media company which is based in New York. The company also provides advertising services as AOL Advertising, AOL mail and AOL Platform.<br />
<br />
<strong>6. <a href=\"http://ask.com\">Ask.com</a>&nbsp;<img alt=\"ask | inspire | web design | perth\" src=\"/desktop/web/ckfinder/userfiles/images/ask-logo.jpg\" style=\"float:right; height:128px; width:200px\" title=\"ask | inspire | web design | perth\" /></strong><br />
Founded in 1995, Ask.com, previously known as Ask Jeeves. Their key concept was to have search results based on a simple question + answer web format. It is a question &amp; answer community where you can get the answers for your question and it integrates a large amount of archive data to answer your question. Because of this dependency on archived and active user contributions the results will not be as current as those you get in Google, Bing and Yahoo. They&rsquo;ve tried to counter where their resources don&rsquo;t have the answer they take help from a third-party search engine. Interestingly they don&rsquo;t name who this is.<br />

<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/desktop/web/ckfinder/userfiles/images/excite%20-%20logo.png\" style=\"float:right; height:104px; width:200px\" /></p>

<p><strong>7. <a href=\"http://www.excite.com/\">Excite</a>&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>Excite is not widely known but is one that still gets into the top 10. Excite is an online service portal that provides internet services like email, search engine, news, instant messaging and weather updates. This also provides us with the latest trends, topics and search for phrases such as: <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/newsbeat/article/37942662/what-will-president-trump-really-be-able-to-do\" target=\"_blank\">What can President Trump actually do?</a>&nbsp;<br />

<p><a href=\"https://www.duckduckgo.com\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>8. DuckDuckGo</strong></a><br />
DuckDuckGo is a popular search engine known for protecting the privacy of the users. Unlike Ask.com they are quite open about who they use to generate search results;&nbsp;they&rsquo;ve partnered with Yahoo, Bing and Yummly.

						<div class="commonText"><p>Search Engines are now part of our daily life, whether it be carrying out research for Xmas presents or where is the nearest coffee shop open before 7am or looking for best Steak House in town. People are now becoming more and more dependent on search engines to get the answer for their everyday queries.<br />
<br />
At Inspire we monitor our search traffic using a variety of analytics. Most of our queries returned are related to what we do and some are simply bizarre. Those we&rsquo;re interested in relate to the services of what we do e.g improving search ranking, web design, web development, and many more.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Much as we utilise &ldquo;all routes to market&rdquo; we are still heavily dependent on the search engines for our bread &amp; butter traffic.<br />
<br />
Recently we did a piece of work for a client looking to reach into the Russian market, they&rsquo;d spoken to other firms who all shared about what they&rsquo;d do on Google and how such experts they are. This completely missed the point as Google are not the dominant search engine in Russia, Yandex is!!!<br />
<br />
This brought it home to me that perhaps people have assumed that because Google is a dominant Global player that they are also the dominant player in every market.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
For that reason we thought it would be worthwhile having a run down on the rest of the World, so let&rsquo;s look at top 12&nbsp;search engines in the world.</p>

<h2>List of Top 12&nbsp;Best Search Engines in The World</h2>

<p><strong>1. <a href="http://www.google.com" target="_blank">Google</a>&nbsp;<a href="http://www.google.co.uk" target="_blank"><img alt="search engine optimisation - Perth - Scotland" src="/desktop/web/ckfinder/userfiles/images/googles-new-logo.gif" style="float:right; height:91px; width:200px" /></a></strong><br />
Google Search Engine is the best search engine in the world and it is also one of most popular products from Google. Almost 70 percent of the Search Engine market has been acquired by Google. The tech giant is always evolving and looking to improve the search engine algorithm to provide best results to the end-user. Although Google appears to be the biggest search engine, as of 2015 YouTube is now more popular than Google (on desktop computers).<br />

<br />
<strong>2. <a href="http://bing.com" target="_blank" title="SEO | Web Design | Perth">Bing</a> &nbsp;<a href="http://www.bing.com" target="_blank"><img alt="SEO | Perth | Web Design | Bing | PPC " src="/desktop/web/ckfinder/userfiles/images/inspire%20it%20services%20-%20SEO.png" style="float:right; height:91px; width:200px" title="SEO | Perth | Web Design | Bing | PPC " /></a></strong><br />
Bing is Microsoft&rsquo;s answer to Google and it was launched in 2009. Bing is the default search engine in Microsoft&rsquo;s web browser. At Bing, they are always striving to make it a better search engine but it&rsquo;s got a long way to go to give Google competition. Microsoft&rsquo;s search engine provides different services including image, web and video search along with maps. Bing introduced Places (Google&rsquo;s equivalent is Google My Business), this is a great platform for business to submit their details to optimise their search results.<br />
<strong>GIVE IT&nbsp;A GO:&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004T54Y2M/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B004T54Y2M&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=afftim0d-20&amp;linkId=427c60280a7aee14d1e62549c555bb83" rel="sponsored" target="_blank">Bing Search App</a><br />
<br />
<strong>3. <a href="http://yahoo.co.uk" target="_blank">Yahoo</a>&nbsp;<a href="http://yahoo.co.uk" target="_blank"><img alt="yahoo | SEO | Perth | Scotland " src="/desktop/web/ckfinder/userfiles/images/yahoo.png" style="float:right; height:91px; width:200px" title="yahoo | SEO | Perth | Scotland " /></a></strong><br />
Yahoo &amp; Bing compete more with each other than with Google. A recent report on netmarketshare.com tells us that Yahoo have a market share of 7.68 percent. Although a leader as a free email provider, this is declining significantly though with their recent acknowledgement that User Details &amp; Passwords where hacked last year.<br />

Baidu is the most used search engine in China and was founded in Jan, 2000 by Chinese Entrepreneur, Eric Xu. This web search is made to deliver results for website, audio files and images. It provides some other services including maps, news, cloud storage and much more.<br />

<strong>5. <a href="http://aol.co.uk">AOL</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<img alt="" src="/desktop/web/ckfinder/userfiles/images/aol.jpg" style="float:right; height:91px; width:200px" /></strong><br />
Aol.com is also among the top search engines. These are the guys that used to send out CD&rsquo;s which you&rsquo;d load onto your PC to install their browser and modem software. Once the pre-eminent player they now have a market share of 0.59 percent. Verizon Communication bought AOL for $4.4 billion. It was started back in 1983 as Control Video Corporation. It was named America Online in 1991 and in 2009 as AOL Inc. AOL is a global mass media company which is based in New York. The company also provides advertising services as AOL Advertising, AOL mail and AOL Platform.<br />
<br />
<strong>6. <a href="http://ask.com">Ask.com</a>&nbsp;<img alt="ask | inspire | web design | perth" src="/desktop/web/ckfinder/userfiles/images/ask-logo.jpg" style="float:right; height:128px; width:200px" title="ask | inspire | web design | perth" /></strong><br />
Founded in 1995, Ask.com, previously known as Ask Jeeves. Their key concept was to have search results based on a simple question + answer web format. It is a question &amp; answer community where you can get the answers for your question and it integrates a large amount of archive data to answer your question. Because of this dependency on archived and active user contributions the results will not be as current as those you get in Google, Bing and Yahoo. They&rsquo;ve tried to counter where their resources don&rsquo;t have the answer they take help from a third-party search engine. Interestingly they don&rsquo;t name who this is.<br />

<p><strong>7. <a href="http://www.excite.com/">Excite</a>&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>Excite is not widely known but is one that still gets into the top 10. Excite is an online service portal that provides internet services like email, search engine, news, instant messaging and weather updates. This also provides us with the latest trends, topics and search for phrases such as: <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/newsbeat/article/37942662/what-will-president-trump-really-be-able-to-do" target="_blank">What can President Trump actually do?</a>&nbsp;<br />

<p><a href="https://www.duckduckgo.com" target="_blank"><strong>8. DuckDuckGo</strong></a><br />

Ph.D. Boris Pevzner  mtpl.boris@gmail.com
Phone 972-545-983-919
(‘Google’ is used as an example only)
1. It is known that the quality of a search according to key words is significantly affected by the algorithms
of ordering output websites. As rule, an user takes account (opens links) only the sites located on first page
of output search result. Those systems that use categorization allow the user to navigate the possible choices
more accurately. But modern search engines have no categories. The main function of the application is to
assign  category codes to output sites (Flws).  The algorithm is based on the principles of learning machine
and data mining. Our application is autonomous independent object. It is connected with Google (or other
search engine) through two standard points-enter (key words) and output (results-links) The developers of the
application will not work with Google codes.
 It should note, that the categories are not search parameters and they are used  to make   easier  the
selection of   the required Web site. The technology is based on the algorithm may be used for marketing , for
filtering of  data from textual news flow and for the evaluation of Internet user’s interests.
2. Creating learning set of each category.
We selected some generic categories (computer, medicine, agriculture, technology, linguistics, science,
education and so on). 
By means of google searches we got the set of websites  of each category ( two first pages- 40 websites). Then
text zone of  a website is extracted by ‘BeautifulSoap’( BeautifulSoup is a Python library for pulling
data out of HTML and XML files )  and then repeated words and stop words are removed from this ‘clear’
website (Flws)
                   After that all ‘clear’ sites are merged into unit file Flunit.   It is the file 
                   corresponding to one of category. Flunit is transformed into a category vector Vcat,
                    It is the learning set of the category. 
 
3. Algorithm of categorization 
The algorithm is based on the principles of learning machine and data mining.
                3.1. Main objects are the category vectors (Vcat ) and the site vectors to which a 
                       code will be assigned  (Vws ) . 
                   Vcat consists of all different words of Flunit. The dimension of Vcat is the number of  
                  different words  of Flunit. It is the number of coordinates. Dimensionality of the 
                 coordinate is frequency of a word into Flunit. A website of output result (Flws)   is 
                 transformed into  a website vector Vws.
                 Vws   consists of all different words of Flunit (Vcat). To each word of Vws is assigned 
                 its site frequency, rest words (relatively Vcat ) have frequency = 0.
                The dimension of Vcat is equal the dimension of Vws. If a word wasn’t  in a website
                   3.2. Our software calculates cosine of an angle ?  between Vcat., in one hand, and 
                Vws, in other hand, for all categories and all output web sites. 
                Cosine between two angles is calculated in this way
 ,
               where xi,yi,zi are vector coordinates. 
               We have the following sequence of pairs for each category Vcat. 
-	V1ws …cos ?1
-	V2ws …  cos ?2
-	   *
-	   *
-	V40ws … cos ?40
              3.4. The software orders these pairs for reducing cos ?.
              3.5. If cos ? is within 1-0.8, then this web site is assigned  the code of category. 
                         For checking of cosine as a proximity measure we made a small test. We had Vcat . We

                        googled according to query ‘data processing’ and got first two pages of output 
                        result. We selected the Website (website1) of first page and the Website of second 
                        (website2). Our program created two vectors Vwb1 and Vwb2.  Cosine(A1) between Vcat 
                                    and Vwb1 =0.80206, cosine(A2)=0.41. The program is assigned to Vwb1 at the
code of 
                       category ‘computer’ and it doesn’t do the same to Vwb2
       Number	Words of category
vector	Frequency in Vcat	Frequency in Vws	Frequency in Vws
		Category vector	Website1 vector	 Website2 vector
          1	      W1	            7	           2	           1
          2	      W2 	            5	           2	           0
          3	      W3	            3	           1	           1
          4	      W4	            3	           0	           2

          6	      W6	            2	           1	           0
          7	      W7	            1	           1	           3
          8		            1	           1	           4
       cosine            			0.80206	            0.41
          3.6. The result of output search can have the following form on the screen of 
                 display:                                                     
                                        Categories      number of output sites, belonged to the category
                                        computer         N1
                                        medicine          N2
                                       agriculture        N3
              3.7. User selects need category (ies) and open links corresponded the 
                     selected category. 
               4. Conclusion
-	Developed technology makes ease a user contact with Google.
The user can more targeted to open the need website and
can access output far sites ( from second page) quite easily. 
-	The technology may be used for marketing, for filtering of  data from textual news flow and for the
evaluation of Internet user interests. 
-	The technology may be used in library  catalogues. 
-	Main requirement of technological software is high speed of data processing.

<p>Unlike many web design or marketing agencies, we do not run automated software and send you out a long technical Website Review Report on what you or indeed your last developer have missed.</p>

<p>We recognise that the web is evolving at a tremendous pace, one real month is equal to one web year, so what was delivered just a few years ago, may very well be looking tired and dated.</p>

<p>At the four BNI Groups we are members of, we are fully signed up to Givers Gain and offer referral clients 20 minutes of our consultancy time (at no charge).</p>

<p>We cover a range of areas such as &quot;What is the objective of your website?&quot;; &quot;What is your business model?&quot;; &quot;Who is your audience?&quot;; then we can cover User eXperience; Usability; Site Analytics; Search Engine Optimisation (On-Site).</p>

<p>We know the value of both your and our time but we also know that we&#39;re keen to build relationships and this approach is the first building block in establishing that mutual trust and respect.</p>
