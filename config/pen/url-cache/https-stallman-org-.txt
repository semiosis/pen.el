Our next rally for Julian Assange is Saturday, March 4 at 11:30 to

	Thursday, February 23 at 6:30,
	at the Community Church of Boston at 565 Boylston St, Boston (Copley Sq):
	a panel discussion,
	"The Future of Gen Z Journalism Depends on Julian Assange's Freedom",
	on how the Julian Assange case will impact the future of journalism.
	<p>
	  This event is part of the fifth annual <em>Student Press Freedom Day</em> initiative
	  &lt;<a href="https://studentpressfreedom.org">https://studentpressfreedom.org</a>&gt;.
	<p>
	  I am not involved personally.

	‘First Night Against the Wars’ is coming up.  Let's have our next stand-out
for Julian starting at 2pm on Dec 31 in *Copley Sq*. at the corner of
Boylston and Dartmouth, in front of Trinity Church.  We are expecting
more activists this year as we join forces with Boston’s new coalition
‘Solidarity Action Network’. The coalition group will be gathering from
noon to 5, bringing all our issues together, crushing inequality, climate
collapse, endless war, nuclear Armageddon and, of course, free speech! It
grew out of the Earth Day Strike a few months back.

	It is important to win him more delegates even though he won't win the
	nomination that way.  Besides, if Biden's various problems knock him
	out, Sanders might yet be nominated.

    <p>
      There should be a law requiring online services, if they close a
      user's account, to <a href="https://www.stallman.org/notes/2022-jul-oct.html#3_September_2022_(Google_canceled_account_over_photo_sent_to_a_doctor)">permit the user to continue to download whatever
      information perse had left in the account</a>.
    <p>
      To be sure, it is foolish to rely on an online service to hold any
      data for you; you should store it locally, and use online services
      only as backups (encrypted).  Preferably more than one online service
      in parallel, for redundancy.  But we should not allow online services
      to cite this as an excuse for arbitrarily causing people great
      avoidable harm.

      It should be a crime to knowingly <a href="https://www.stallman.org/archives/2021-jan-apr.html#13_March_2021_(Passengers_with_no_masks)">approach a person while maskless</a> inside

    *The pandemic has taken <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/dec/14/pandemic-workers-surveillance-monitor-jobs">surveillance of workers</a> to the next level.*
    <p>
      The extreme of this is represented by the Amazon warehouse,
      where a worker's every move is controlled by the computer system.
      This is one of <a href="/amazon.html">many reasons to refuse to buy from Amazon</a>.
    <p>
      Unfortunately, surveillance of workers is not limited to Amazon.  I
      think states should pass laws to limit surveillance of workers.  It
      should cover independent contractors as well as employees.
    <p>
      The law should completely forbid demanding that workers run any
      specific software on their own computers (keep in mind that portable
      phones are computers); the employer who wants that must furnish
      the computer at no charge.

  <li id="face-recognition-limit">
    A hundred years ago, having your face photo circulated as a suspect
    could <a href="https://slate.com/technology/2020/02/rogues-gallery-facial-recognition-technology-history.html">direct persecution at you</a> &mdash; for instance, making it impossible to get a job.
    <p>
      Now it can cause you to be arrested randomly for walking down the street.
    <p>
      If stores use face recognition inside the store, they should not be
      allowed to use photos for matching against people in the store
      except for photos they have taken in that store, and photos
      of people convicted of theft and fraud.

with a new demand for earnestness: for a country to be invited, it
will have to pledne to end licensing and funding of new oil and gas
reserves and

Bravo, Gutierres!  It is heart-warming to see someone in a position of
importance who recognizes what priorities are needed for survival.
<p>
With his influence, he has a chance of overcoming the power of fossil
fools.  It won't be easy to beat tham, but civilization depends on it,
and every young person's life is at risk.

<p>
Here's my list of countries with no national ID cards
and no plans for one: Australia, Canada, New Zealand, UK.
Australia's previous government tried to
institute national ID cards, but the Labor government dropped
the plan.</p>

<p>India has mostly finished imposing a national biometric ID number
in a grand act of oppression.
</p>

<p>Switzerland has national ID cards which are optional,
but they or some other government ID card are needed for some purposes.
<p>
Iceland doesn't have ID cards as such, but they
have ID numbers that citizens are forced to use frequently.
For example, the national ID number is often required to
rent a video or use a gym.
</p>

<p>
Denmark issues non-photo ID cards with a "person number", and many
services use this card to identify people.
</p>

<p>
Norway will impose a national
<a href="http://people.skolelinux.org/pere/blog/Norwegian_citizens_now_required_by_law_to_give_their_fingerprint_to_the_police.html">biometric
ID card</a>.

<h3>The Lifelong Activist</h3>
<p>
People often ask how I manage to continue devoting myself to
progressive activism (such as the free software movement) for
years without burning out.  The best way I can answer is by
recommending a book, <a href="http://lifelongactivist.com">
The Lifelong Activist</a> by Hillary Rettig.

<p>I disagree with the book on one theoretical point in the last
part of the book: we shouldn't think of political activism as
<em>being</em> marketing and sales, because those terms refer to
business, and politics is something much more
important than mere business.  However, this doesn't diminish
the value of the book's practical advice about borrowing
techniques from marketing and sales.</p>
