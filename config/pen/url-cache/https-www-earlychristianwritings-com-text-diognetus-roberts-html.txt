<H3>The Epistle of Mathetes to Diognetus</H3>
<P>CHAPTER I -- OCCASION OF THE EPISTLE. 
<P>Since I see thee, most excellent Diognetus, exceedingly desirous to learn the 
mode of worshipping God prevalent among the Christians, and inquiring very 
carefully and earnestly concerning them, what God they trust in, and what form 
of religion they observe, so as all to look down upon the world itself, and 
despise death, while they neither esteem those to be gods that are reckoned such 
by the Greeks, nor hold to the superstition of the Jews; and what is the 
affection which they cherish among themselves; and why, in fine, this new kind 
or practice [of piety] has only now entered into the world, and not long ago; I 
cordially welcome this thy desire, and I implore God, who enables us both to 
speak and to hear, to grant to me so to speak, that, above all, I may hear you 
have been edified, and to you so to hear, that I who speak may have no cause of 
regret for having done so. 
<P>CHAPTER II -- THE VANITY OF IDOLS. 
<P>Come, then, after you have freed yourself from all prejudices possessing your 
mind, and laid aside what you have been accustomed to, as something apt to 
deceive you, and being made, as if from the beginning, a new man, inasmuch as, 
according to your own confession, you are to be the hearer of a new [system of] 
doctrine; come and contemplate, not with your eyes only, but with your 
understanding, the substance and the form of those whom ye declare and deem to 
be gods. Is not one of them a stone similar to that on which we tread? Is not a 
second brass, in no way superior to those vessels which are constructed for our 
ordinary use? Is not a third wood, and that already rotten? Is not a fourth 
silver, which needs a man to watch it, lest it be stolen? Is not a fifth iron, 
consumed by rust? Is not a sixth earthenware, in no degree more valuable than 
that which is formed for the humblest purposes? Are not all these of corruptible 
matter? Are they not fabricated by means of iron and fire? Did not the sculptor 
fashion one of them, the brazier a second, the silversmith a third, and the 
potter a fourth? Was not every one of them, before they were formed by the arts 
of these [workmen] into the shape of these [gods], each in its own way subject 
to change? Would not those things which are now vessels, formed of the same 
materials, become like to such, if they met with the same artificers? Might not 
these, which are now worshipped by you, again be made by men vessels similar to 
others? Are they not all deaf? Are they not blind? Are they not without life? 
Are they not destitute of feeling? Are they not incapable of motion? Are they 
not all liable to rot? Are they not all corruptible? These things ye call gods; 
these ye serve; these ye worship; and ye become altogether like to them. For 
this reason ye hate the Christians, because they do not deem these to be gods. 
But do not ye yourselves, who now think and suppose [such to be gods], much more 
cast contempt upon them than they [the Christians do]? Do ye not much more mock 
and insult them, when ye worship those that are made of stone and earthenware, 
without appointing any persons to guard them; but those made of silver and gold 
ye shut up by night, and appoint watchers to look after them by day, lest they 
be stolen? And by those gifts which ye mean to present to them, do ye not, if 
they are possessed of sense, rather punish [than honour] them? But if, on the 
other hand, they are destitute of sense, ye convict them of this fact, while ye 
worship them with blood and the smoke of sacrifices. Let any one of you suffer 
such indignities! Let any one of you endure to have such things done to himself! 
But not a single human being will, unless compelled to it, endure such 
treatment, since he is endowed with sense and reason. A stone, however, readily 
bears it, seeing it is insensible. Certainly you do not show [by your conduct] 
that he [your God] is possessed of sense. And as to the fact that Christians are 
not accustomed to serve such gods, I might easily find many other things to say; 
but if even what has been said does not seem to any one sufficient, I deem it 
idle to say anything further. 
<P>CHAPTER III -- SUPERSTITIONS OF THE JEWS. 
<P>And next, I imagine that you are most desirous of hearing something on this 
point, that the Christians do not observe the same forms of divine worship as do 
the Jews. The Jews, then, if they abstain from the kind of service above 
described, and deem it proper to worship one God as being Lord of all, [are 
right]; but if they offer Him worship in the way which we have described, they 
greatly err. For while the Gentiles, by offering such things to those that are 
destitute of sense and hearing, furnish an example of madness; they, on the 
other hand by thinking to offer these things to God as if He needed them, might 
justly reckon it rather an act of folly than of divine worship. For He that made 
heaven and earth, and all that is therein, and gives to us all the things of 
which we stand in need, certainly requires none of those things which He Himself 
bestows on such as think of furnishing them to Him. But those who imagine that, 
by means of blood, and the smoke of sacrifices and burnt-offerings, they offer 
sacrifices [acceptable] to Him, and that by such honours they show Him 
respect,--these, by supposing that they can give anything to Him who stands in 
need of nothing, appear to me in no respect to differ from those who studiously 
confer the same honour on things destitute of sense, and which therefore are 
unable to enjoy such honours. 
<P>CHAPTER IV -- THE OTHER OBSERVANCES OF THE JEWS. 
<P>But as to their scrupulosity concerning meats, and their superstition as 
respects the Sabbaths, and their boasting about circumcision, and their fancies 
about fasting and the new moons, which are utterly ridiculous and unworthy of 
notice,--I do not think that you require to learn anything from me. For, to 
accept some of those things which have been formed by God for the use of men as 
properly formed, and to reject others as useless and redundant,--how can this be 
lawful? And to speak falsely of God, as if He forbade us to do what is good on 
the Sabbath-days,--how is not this impious? And to glory in the circumcision of 
the flesh as a proof of election, and as if, on account of it, they were 
specially beloved by God,--how is it not a subject of ridicule? And as to their 
observing months and days, as if waiting upon the stars and the moon, and their 
distributing, according to their own tendencies, the appointments of God, and 
the vicissitudes of the seasons, some for festivities, and others for 
mourning,--who would deem this a part of divine worship, and not much rather a 
manifestation of folly? I suppose, then, you are sufficiently convinced that the 
ChriStians properly abstain from the vanity and error common [to both Jews and 
Gentiles], and from the busy-body spirit and vain boasting of the Jews; but you 
must not hope to learn the mystery of their peculiar mode of worshipping God 
from any mortal. 
<P>CHAPTER V -- THE MANNERS OF THE CHRISTIANS. 
<P>For the Christians are distinguished from other men neither by country, nor 
language, nor the customs which they observe. For they neither inhabit cities of 
their own, nor employ a peculiar form of speech, nor lead a life which is marked 
out by any singularity. The course of conduct which they follow has not been 
devised by any speculation or deliberation of inquisitive men; nor do they, like 
some, proclaim themselves the advocates of any merely human doctrines. But, 
inhabiting Greek as well as barbarian cities, according as the lot of each of 
them has determined, and following the customs of the natives in respect to 
clothing, food, and the rest of their ordinary conduct, they display to us their 
wonderful and confessedly striking method of life. They dwell in their own 
countries, but simply as sojourners. As citizens, they share in all things with 
others, and yet endure all things as if foreigners. Every foreign land is to 
them as their native country, and every land of their birth as a land of 
strangers. They marry, as do all [others]; they beget children; but they do not 
destroy their offspring. They have a common table, but not a common bed. They 
are in the flesh, but they do not live after the flesh. They pass their days on 
earth, but they are citizens of heaven. They obey the prescribed laws, and at 
the same time surpass the laws by their lives. They love all men, and are 
persecuted by all. They are unknown and condemned; they are put to death, and 
restored to life. They are poor, yet make many rich; they are in lack of all 
things, and yet abound in all; they are dishonoured, and yet in their very 
dishonour are glorified. They are evil spoken of, and yet are justified; they 
are reviled, and bless; they are insulted, and repay the insult with honour; 
they do good, yet are punished as evil-doers. When punished, they rejoice as if 
quickened into life; they are assailed by the Jews as foreigners, and are 
persecuted by the Greeks; yet those who hate them are unable to assign any 
reason for their hatred. 
<P>CHAPTER VI -- THE RELATION OF CHRISTIANS TO THE WORLD. 
<P>To sum up all in one word--what the soul is in the body, that are Christians 
in the world. The soul is dispersed through all the members of the body, and 
Christians are scattered through all the cities of the world. The soul dwells in 
the body, yet is not of the body; and Christians dwell in the world, yet are not 
of the world. The invisible soul is guarded by the visible body, and Christians 
are known indeed to be in the world, but their godliness remains invisible. The 
flesh hates the soul, and wars against it, though itself suffering no injury, 
because it is prevented from enjoying pleasures; the world also hates the 
Christians, though in nowise injured, because they abjure pleasures. The soul 
loves the flesh that hates it, and [loves also] the members; Christians likewise 
love those that hate them. The soul is imprisoned in the body, yet preserves 
that very body; and Christians are confined in the world as in a prison, and yet 
they are the preservers of the world. The immortal soul dwells in a mortal 
tabernacle; and Christians dwell as sojourners in corruptible [bodies], looking 
for an incorruptible dwelling in the heavens. The soul, when but ill-provided 
with food and drink, becomes better; in like manner, the Christians, though 
subjected day by day to punishment, increase the more in number. God has 
assigned them this illustrious position, which it were unlawful for them to 
forsake. 
<P>CHAPTER VII -- THE MANIFESTATION OF CHRIST. 
<P>For, as I said, this was no mere earthly invention which was delivered to 
them, nor is it a mere human system of opinion, which they judge it right to 
preserve so carefully, nor has a dispensation of mere human mysteries been 
committed to them, but truly God Himself, who is almighty, the Creator of all 
things, and invisible, has sent from heaven, and placed among men, [Him who is] 
the truth, and the holy and incomprehensible Word, and has firmly established 
Him in their hearts. He did not, as one might have imagined, send to men any 
servant, or angel, or ruler, or any one of those who bear sway over earthly 
things, or one of those to whom the government of things in the heavens has been 
entrusted, but the very Creator and Fashioner of all things--by whom He made the 
heavens--by whom he enclosed the sea within its proper bounds--whose ordinances 
all the stars faithfully observe--from whom the sun has received the measure of 
his daily course to be observed--whom the moon obeys, being commanded to shine 
in the night, and whom the stars also obey, following the moon in her course; by 
whom all things have been arranged, and placed within their proper limits, and 
to whom all are subject--the heavens and the things that are therein, the earth 
and the things that are therein, the sea and the things that are therein--fire, 
air, and the abyss--the things which are in the heights, the things which are in 
the depths, and the things which lie between. This [messenger] He sent to them. 
Was it then, as one might conceive, for the purpose of exercising tyranny, or of 
inspiring fear and terror? By no means, but under the influence of clemency and 
meekness. As a king sends his son, who is also a king, so sent He Him; as God He 
sent Him; as to men He sent Him; as a Saviour He sent Him, and as seeking to 
persuade, not to compel us; for violence has no place in the character of God. 
As calling us He sent Him, not as vengefully pursuing us; as loving us He sent 
Him, not as judging us. For He will yet send Him to judge us, and who shall 
endure His appearing? ... Do you not see them exposed to wild beasts, that they 
may be persuaded to deny the Lord, and yet not overcome? Do you not see that the 
more of them are punished, the greater becomes the number of the rest? This does 
not seem to be the work of man: this is the power of God; these are the 
evidences of His manifestation. 
<P>CHAPTER VIII -- THE MISERABLE STATE OF MEN BEFORE THE COMING OF THE WORD. 
<P>For, who of men at all understood before His coming what God is? Do you 
accept of the vain and silly doctrines of those who are deemed trustworthy 
philosophers? of whom some said that fire was God, calling that God to which 
they themselves were by and by to come; and some water; and others some other of 
the elements formed by God. But if any one of these theories be worthy of 
approbation, every one of the rest of created things might also be declared to 
be God. But such declarations are simply the startling and erroneous utterances 
of deceivers; and no man has either seen Him, or made Him known, but He has 
revealed Himself. And He has manifested Himself through faith, to which alone it 
is given to behold God. For God, the Lord and Fashioner of all things, who made 
all things, and assigned them their several positions, proved Himself not merely 
a friend of mankind, but also long-suffering [in His dealings with them.] Yea, 
He was always of such a character, and still is, and will ever be, kind and 
good, and free from wrath, and true, and the only one who is [absolutely] good; 
and He formed in His mind a great and unspeakable conception, which He 
communicated to His Son alone. As long, then, as He held and preserved His own 
wise counsel in concealment, He appeared to neglect us, and to have no care over 
us. But after He revealed and laid open, through His beloved Son, the things 
which had been prepared from the beginning, He conferred every blessing all at 
once upon us, so that we should both share in His benefits, and see and be 
active [in His service]. Who of us would ever have expected these things? He was 
aware, then, of all things in His own mind, along with His Son, according to the 
relation subsisting between them. 
<P>CHAPTER IX -- WHY THE SON WAS SENT SO LATE. 
<P>As long then as the former time endured, He permitted us to be borne along by 
unruly impulses, being drawn away by the desire of pleasure and various lusts. 
This was not that He at all delighted in our sins, but that He simply endured 
them; nor that He approved the time of working iniquity which then was, but that 
He sought to form a mind conscious of righteousness, so that being convinced in 
that time of our unworthiness of attaining life through our own works, it should 
now, through the kindness of God, be vouchsafed to us; and having made it 
manifest that in ourselves we were unable to enter into the kingdom of God, we 
might through the power of God be made able. But when our wickedness had reached 
its height, and it had been clearly shown that its reward, punishment and death, 
was impending over us; and when the time had come which God had before appointed 
for manifesting His own kindness and power, how the one love of God, through 
exceeding regard for men, did not regard us with hatred, nor thrust us away, nor 
remember our iniquity against us, but showed great long-suffering, and bore with 
us, He Himself took on Him the burden of our iniquities, He gave His own Son as 
a ransom for us, the holy One for transgressors, the blameless One for the 
wicked, the righteous One for the unrighteous, the incorruptible One for the 
corruptible, the immortal One for them that are mortal. For what other thing was 
capable of covering our sins than His righteousness? By what other one was it 
possible that we, the wicked and ungodly, could be justified, than by the only 
Son of God? O sweet exchange! O unsearchable operation! O benefits surpassing 
all expectation! that the wickedness of many should be hid in a single righteous 
One, and that the righteousness of One should justify many transgressors! Having 
therefore convinced us in the former time that our nature was unable to attain 
to life, and having now revealed the Saviour who is able to save even those 
things which it was [formerly] impossible to save, by both these facts He 
desired to lead us to trust in His kindness, to esteem Him our Nourisher, 
Father, Teacher, Counsellor, Healer, our Wisdom, Light, Honour, Glory, Power, 
and Life, so that we should not be anxious[ concerning clothing and food. 
<P>CHAPTER X -- THE BLESSINGS THAT WILL FLOW FROM FAITH. 
<P>If you also desire [to possess] this faith, you likewise shall receive first 
of all the knowledge of the Father. For God has loved mankind, on whose account 
He made the world, to whom He rendered subject all the things that are in it, to 
whom He gave reason and understanding, to whom alone He imparted the privilege 
of looking upwards to Himself, whom He formed after His own image, to whom He 
sent His only-begotten Son, to whom He has promised a kingdom in heaven, and 
will give it to those who have loved Him. And when you have attained this 
knowledge, with what joy do you think you will be filled? Or, how will you love 
Him who has first so loved you? And if you love Him, you will be an imitator of 
His kindness. And do not wonder that a man may become an imitator of God. He 
can, if he is willing. For it is not by ruling over his neighbours, or by 
seeking to hold the supremacy over those that are weaker, or by being rich, and 
showing violence towards those that are inferior, that happiness is found; nor 
can any one by these things become an imitator of God. But these things do not 
at all constitute His majesty. On the contrary he who takes upon himself the 
burden of his neighbour; he who, in whatsoever respect he may be superior, is 
ready to benefit another who is deficient; he who, whatsoever things he has 
received from God, by distributing these to the needy, becomes a god to those 
who receive [his benefits]: he is an imitator of God. Then thou shalt see, while 
still on earth, that God in the heavens rules over [the universe]; then thou 
shall begin to speak the mysteries of God; then shalt thou both love and admire 
those that suffer punishment because they will not deny God; then shall thou 
condemn the deceit and error of the world when thou shall know what it is to 
live truly in heaven, when thou shalt despise that which is here esteemed to be 
death, when thou shalt fear what is truly death, which is reserved for those who 
shall be condemned to the eternal fire, which shall afflict those even to the 
end that are committed to it. Then shalt thou admire those who for 
righteousness' sake endure the fire that is but for a moment, and shalt count 
them happy when thou shalt know [the nature of] that fire. 
<P>CHAPTER XI -- THESE THINGS ARE WORTHY TO BE KNOWN AND BELIEVED. 
<P>I do not speak of things strange to me, nor do I aim at anything inconsistent 
with right reason; but having been a disciple of the Apostles, I am become a 
teacher of the Gentiles. I minister the things delivered to me to those that are 
disciples worthy of the truth. For who that is rightly taught and begotten by 
the loving Word, would not seek to learn accurately the things which have been 
clearly shown by the Word to His disciples, to whom the Word being manifested 
has revealed them, speaking plainly [to them], not understood indeed by the 
unbelieving, but conversing with the disciples, who, being esteemed faithful by 
Him, acquired a knowledge of the mysteries of the Father? For which s reason He 
sent the Word, that He might be manifested to the world; and He, being despised 
by the people [of the Jews], was, when preached by the Apostles, believed on by 
the Gentiles. This is He who was from the beginning, who appeared as if new, and 
was found old, and yet who is ever born afresh in the hearts of the saints. This 
is He who, being from everlasting, is to-day called the Son; through whom the 
Church is enriched, and grace, widely spread, increases in the saints. 
furnishing understanding, revealing mysteries, announcing times, rejoicing over 
the faithful. giving to those that seek, by whom the limits of faith are not 
broken through, nor the boundaries set by the fathers passed over. Then the fear 
of the law is chanted, and the grace of the prophets is known, and the faith of 
the gospels is established, and the tradition of the Apostles is preserved, and 
the grace of the Church exults; which grace if you grieve not, you shall know 
those things which the Word teaches, by whom He wills, and when He pleases. For 
whatever things we are moved to utter by the will of the Word commanding us, we 
communicate to you with pains, and from a love of the things that have been 
revealed to us. 
<P>CHAPTER XII -- THE IMPORTANCE OF KNOWLEDGE TO TRUE SPIRITUAL LIFE. 
<P>When you have read and carefully listened to these things, you shall know 
what God bestows on such as rightly love Him, being made [as ye are] a paradise 
of delight, presenting in yourselves a tree bearing all kinds of produce and 
flourishing well, being adorned with various fruits. For in this place the tree 
of knowledge and the tree of life have been planted; but it is not the tree of 
knowledge that destroys--it is disobedience that proves destructive. Nor truly 
are those words without significance which are written, how God from the 
beginning planted the tree of life in the midst of paradise, revealing through 
knowledge the way to life, and when those who were first formed did not use this 
[knowledge] properly, they were, through the fraud of the Serpent, stripped 
naked. For neither can life exist without knowledge, nor is knowledge secure 
without life. Wherefore both were planted close together. The Apostle, 
perceiving the force [of this conjunction], and blaming that knowledge which, 
without true doctrine, is admitted to influence life, declares, "Knowledge 
puffeth up, but love edifieth." For he who thinks he knows anything without true 
knowledge, and such as is witnessed to by life, knows nothing, but is deceived 
by the Serpent, as not loving life. But he who combines knowledge with fear, and 
seeks after life, plants in hope, looking for fruit. Let your heart be your 
wisdom; and let your life be true knowledge inwardly received. Bearing this tree 
and displaying its fruit, thou shalt always gather in those things which are 
desired by God, which the Serpent cannot reach, and to which deception does not 
approach; nor is Eve then corrupted, but is trusted as a virgin; and salvation 
is manifested, and the Apostles are filled with understanding, and the Passover 
of the Lord advances, and the choirs are gathered together, and are arranged in 
proper order, and the Word rejoices in teaching the saints,--by whom the Father 
is glorified: to whom be glory for ever. Amen.
