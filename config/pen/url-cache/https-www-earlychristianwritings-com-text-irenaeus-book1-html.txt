<P>1. Inasmuch 
as certain men have set the truth aside, and bring in lying words and vain 
genealogies, which, as the apostle says, 
"minister questions rather than godly edifying which is in faith," and by means 
of their craftily-constructed plausibilities draw away the minds of the 
inexperienced and take them captive, [I have felt constrained, my dear friend, 
to compose the following treatise in order to expose and counteract their 
machinations.] These men falsify the oracles of God, and prove themselves evil 
interpreters of the good word of revelation. They also overthrow the faith of 
many, by drawing them away, under a pretence of [superior] knowledge, from Him 
who rounded and adorned the universe; as if, forsooth, they had something more 
excellent and sublime to reveal, than that God who created the heaven and the 
earth, and all things that are therein. By means of specious and plausible 
words, they cunningly allure the simple-minded to inquire into their system; but 
they nevertheless clumsily destroy them, while they initiate them into their 
blasphemous and impious opinions respecting the Demiurge; 
and these simple ones are unable, even in such a matter, to distinguish 
falsehood from truth.</P>
<P>2. Error, indeed, is never set forth in its naked deformity, lest, being thus 
exposed, it should at once be detected. But it is craftily decked out in an 
attractive dress, so as, by its outward form, to make it appear to the 
inexperienced (ridiculous as the expression may seem) more true than the truth 
itself. One
far superior to me has well said, in reference to this point, "A clever 
imitation in glass casts contempt, as it were, on that precious jewel the 
emerald (which is most highly esteemed by some), unless it come under the eye of 
one able to test and expose the counterfeit. Or, again, what inexperienced 
person can with ease detect the presence of brass when it has been mixed up with 
silver? "Lest, therefore, through my neglect, some should be carried off, even 
as sheep are by wolves, while they perceive not the true character of these men, 
-because they outwardly are covered with sheep's clothing (against whom the Lord 
has enjoined
us to be on our guard), and because their language resembles ours, while their 
sentiments are very different,-I have deemed it my duty (after reading some of 
the <I>Commentaries</I>, as they call them, of the disciples of Valentinus, and 
after making myself acquainted with their tenets through personal intercourse 
with some of them) to unfold to thee, my friend, these portentous and profound 
mysteries, which do not fall within the range of every intellect, because all 
have not sufficiently purged
their brains. I do this, in order that thou, obtaining an acquaintance with 
these things, mayest in turn explain them to all those with whom thou art 
connected, and exhort them to avoid such an abyss of madness and of blasphemy 
against Christ. I intend, then, to the best of my ability, with brevity and 
clearness to set forth the opinions of those who are now promulgating heresy. I 
refer especially to the disciples of Ptolemaeus, whose school may be described 
as a bud from that of Valentinus. I shall also endeavour, according to my 
moderate ability, to furnish the means of overthrowing them, by showing how 
absurd and inconsistent with the truth are their statements. Not that I am 
practised either in composition or eloquence; but my feeling of affection 
prompts me to make known to thee and all thy companions those doctrines which 
have been kept in concealment until now, but which are at last, through the 
goodness of God, brought to light. "For there is nothing hidden which shall not 
be revealed, nor secret that shall not be made known." 
</P>
<P>3. Thou wilt not expect from me, who am resident among the Keltae,
and am accustomed for the most part to use a barbarous dialect, any display of 
rhetoric, which I have never learned, or any excellence of composition, which I 
have never practised, or any beauty and persuasiveness of style, to which I make 
no pretensions. But thou wilt accept in a kindly spirit what I in a like spirit 
write to thee simply, truthfully, and in my own homely way; whilst thou thyself 
(as being more capable than I am) wilt expand those ideas of which I send thee, 
as it were, only the seminal principles; and in the comprehensiveness of thy 
understanding, wilt develop to their full extent the points on which I briefly 
touch, so as to set with power before thy companions those things which I have 
uttered in weakness. In fine, as I (to gratify thy long-cherished desire for 
information regarding the tenets of these persons) have spared no pains, not 
only to make these doctrines known to thee, but also to furnish the means of 
showing their falsity; so shalt thou, according to the grace given to thee by 
the Lord, prove an earnest and efficient minister to others, that men may no 
longer be drawn away by the plausible system of these heretics, which I now 
proceed to describe.

  Disciples of Valentinus as to the Origin, Name, Order, and Conjugal 
  Productions of Their Fancied Aeons, with the Passages of Scripture Which They 
  Adapt to Their Opinions.</FONT></P></UL>
<P>1. They maintain, then, that in the invisible and ineffable heights above 
there exists a certain perfect, pre-existent Aeon,
whom they call Proarche, Propator, and Bythus, and describe as being invisible 
and incomprehensible. Eternal and unbegotten, he remained throughout innumerable 
cycles of ages in profound serenity and quiescence. There existed along with him 
Ennoea, whom they also call Charis and Sige.
At last this Bythus determined to send forth from himself the beginning of all 
things, and deposited this production (which he had resolved to bring forth) in 
his contemporary Sige, even as seed is deposited in the womb. She then, having 
received this seed, and becoming pregnant, gave birth to Nous, who was both 
similar and equal to him who had produced him, and was alone capable of 
comprehending his father's greatness. This Nous they call also Monogenes, and 
Father, and the Beginning of all Things. Along with him was also produced 
Aletheia; and these four constituted the first and first-begotten Pythagorean 
Tetrad, which they also denominate the root of all things. For there are first 
Bythus and Sige, and then Nous and Aletheia. And Monogenes, perceiving for what 
purpose he had been produced, also himself sent forth Logos and Zoe, being the 
father of all those who were to come after him, and the beginning and fashioning 
of the entire Pleroma. By the conjunction of Logos and Zoo were brought forth 
Anthropos and Ecclesia; and thus was formed the first-begotten Ogdoad, the root 
and substance of all things, called among them by four names, viz., Bythus, and 
Nous, and Logos, and Anthropos. For each of these is masculo-feminine, as 
follows: Propator was united by a conjunction with his Ennoea; then Monogenes, 
that is Nous, with Aletheia; Logos with Zoe, and Anthropos with Ecclesia.</P>
<P>2. These Aeons having been produced for the glory of the Father, and wishing, 
by their own efforts, to effect this object, sent forth emanations by means of 
conjunction. Logos and Zoe, after producing Anthropos and Ecclesia, sent forth 
other ten Aeons, whose names are the following: Bythius and Mixis, Ageratos and 
Henosis, Autophyes and Hedone, Acinetos and Syncrasis, Monogenes and 
Macaria.
These are the ten Aeons whom they declare to have been produced by Logos and 
Zoe. They then add that Anthropos himself, along with Ecclesia, produced twelve 
Aeons, to whom they give the following names: Paracletus and Pistis, Patricos 
and Elpis, Metricos and Agape, Ainos and Synesis, Ecclesiasticus and Macariotes, 
Theletos and Sophia.</P>
<P>3. Such are the thirty Aeons in the erroneous system of these men; and they 
are described as being wrapped up, so to speak, in silence, and known to none 
[except these professing teachers]. Moreover, they declare that this invisible 
and spiritual Pleroma of theirs is tripartite, being divided into an Ogdoad, a 
Decad, and a Duodecad. And for this reason they affirm it was that the 
"Saviour"-for they do not please to call Him "Lord"-did no work in public during 
the space of thirty years,
thus setting forth the mystery of these Aeons. They maintain also, that these 
thirty Aeons are most plainly indicated in the parable
of the labourers sent into the vineyard. For some are sent about the first hour, 
others about the third hour, others about the sixth hour, others about the ninth 
hour, and others about the eleventh hour. Now, if we add up the numbers of the 
hours here mentioned, the sum total will be thirty: for one, three, six, nine, 
and eleven, when added together, form thirty. And by the hours, they hold that 
the Aeons were pointed out; while they maintain that these are great, and 
wonderful, and hitherto unspeakable mysteries which it is their special function 
to develop; and so they proceed when they find anything in the multitude
of things contained in the Scriptures which they can adopt and accommodate to 
their baseless speculations.</P>

  and of the Holy Spirit, in Order to the Completion of the Aeons. Manner of the

<P>1. They proceed to tell us that the Propator of their scheme was known only 
to Monogenes, who sprang from him; in other words, only to Nous, while to all 
the others he was invisible and incomprehensible. And, according to them, Nous 
alone took pleasure in contemplating the Father, and exulting in considering his 
immeasurable greatness; while he also meditated how he might communicate to the 
rest of the Aeons the greatness of the Father, revealing to them how vast and 
mighty he was, and how he was without beginning,-beyond comprehension, and 
altogether incapable of being seen. But, in accordance with the will of the 
Father, Sige restrained him, because it was his design to lead them all to an 
acquaintance with the aforesaid Propator, and to create within them a desire of 
investigating his nature. In like manner, the rest of the Aeons also, in a kind 
of quiet way, had a wish to behold the Author of their being, and to contemplate 
that First Cause which had no beginning.</P>
<P>2. But there rushed forth in advance of the rest that Aeon who was much the 
latest of them, and was the youngest of the Duodecad which sprang from Anthropos 
and Ecclesia, namely Sophia, and suffered passion apart from the embrace of her 
consort Theletos. This passion, indeed, first arose among those who were 
connected with Nous and Aletheia, but passed as by contagion to this degenerate 
Aeon, who acted under a pretence of love, but was in reality influenced by 
temerity, because she had not, like Nous, enjoyed communion with the perfect 
Father. This passion, they say, consisted in a desire to search into the nature 
of the Father; for she wished, according to them, to comprehend his greatness. 
When she could not attain her end, inasmuch as she aimed at an impossibility, 
and thus became involved in an extreme agony of mind, while both on account of 
the vast profundity as well as the unsearchable nature of the Father, and on 
account of the love she bore him, she was ever stretching herself forward, there 
was danger lest she should at last have been absorbed by his sweetness, and 
resolved into his absolute essence, unless she had met with that Power which 
supports all things, and preserves them outside of the unspeakable greatness. 
This power they term Horos; by whom, they say, she was restrained and supported; 
and that then, having with difficulty been brought back to herself, she was 
convinced that the Father is incomprehensible, and so laid aside her original 
design, along with that passion which had arisen within her from the 
overwhelming influence of her admiration.</P>
<P>3. But others of them fabulously describe the passion and restoration of 
Sophia as follows: They say that she, having engaged in an impossible and 
impracticable attempt, brought forth an amorphous substance, such as her female 
nature enabled her to produce.
When she looked upon it, her first feeling was one of grief, on account of the 
imperfection of its generation, and then of fear lest this should end
her own existence. Next she lost, as it were, all command of herself, and was in 
the greatest perplexity while endeavouring to discover the cause of all this, 
and in what way she might conceal what had happened. Being greatly harassed by 
these passions, she at last changed her mind, and endeavoured to return anew to 
the Father. When, however, she in some measure made the attempt, strength failed 
her, and she became a suppliant of the Father. The other Aeons, Nous in 
particular, presented their supplications along with her. And hence they declare 
material substance
had its beginning from ignorance and grief, and fear and bewilderment.</P>
<P>4. The Father afterwards produces, in his own image, by means of Monogenes, 
the above-mentioned Horos, without conjunction,
masculo-feminine. For they maintain that sometimes the Father acts in 
conjunction with Sige, but that at other times he shows himself independent both 
of male and female. They term this Horos both Stauros and Lytrotes, and 
Carpistes, and Horothetes, and Metagoges. 
And by this Horos they declare that Sophia was purified and established, while 
she was also restored to her proper conjunction. For her enthymesis (or inborn 
idea) having been taken away from her, along with its supervening passion, she 
herself certainly remained within the Pleroma; but her enthymesis, with its 
passion, was separated from her by Horos, fenced
off, and expelled from that circle. This enthymesis was, no doubt, a spiritual 
substance, possessing some of the natural tendencies of an Aeon, but at the same 
time shapeless and without form, because it had received nothing.
And on this account they say that it was an imbecile and feminine 
production.
</P>
<P>5. After this substance had been placed outside of the Pleroma of the Aeons, 
and its mother restored to her proper conjunction, they tell us that Monogenes, 
acting in accordance with the prudent forethought of the Father, gave origin to 
another conjugal pair, namely Christ and the Holy Spirit (lest any of the Aeons 
should fall into a calamity similar to that of Sophia), for the purpose of 
fortifying and strengthening the Pleroma, and who at the same time completed the 
number of the Aeons. Christ then instructed them as to the nature of their 
conjunction, and taught them that those who possessed a comprehension of the 
Unbegotten were sufficient for themselves. 
He also announced among them what related to the knowledge of the 
Father,-namely, that he cannot be understood or comprehended, nor so much as 
seen or heard, except in so far as he is known by Monogenes only. And the reason 
why the rest of the Aeons possess perpetual existence is found in that part of 
the Father's nature which is incomprehensible; but the reason of their origin 
and formation was situated in that which may be comprehended regarding him, that 
is, in the Son.
Christ, then, who had just been produced, effected these things among them.</P>
<P>6. But the Holy Spirit
taught them to give thanks on being all rendered equal among themselves, and led 
them to a state of true repose. Thus, then, they tell us that the Aeons were 
constituted equal to each other in form and sentiment, so that all became as 
Nous, and Logos, and Anthropos, and Christus. The female Aeons, too, became all 
as Aletheia, and Zoe, and Spiritus, and Ecclesia. Everything, then, being thus 
established, and brought into a state of perfect rest, they next tell us that 
these beings sang praises with great joy to the Propator, who himself shared in 
the abounding exaltation. Then, out of gratitude for the great benefit which had 
been conferred on them, the whole Pleroma of the Aeons, with one design and 
desire, and with the concurrence of Christ and the Holy Spirit, their Father 
also setting the seal of His approval on their conduct, brought together 
whatever each one had in himself of the greatest beauty and preciousness; and 
uniting all these contributions so as skilfully to blend the whole, they 
produced, to the honour and glory of Bythus, a being of most perfect beauty, the 
very star of the Pleroma, and the perfect fruit [of it], namely Jesus. Him they 
also speak of under the name of Saviour, and Christ, and patronymically, Logos, 
and Everything, because He was formed from the contributions of all. And then we 
are told that, by way of honour, angels of the same nature as Himself were 
simultaneously produced, to act as His body-guard. </P>

  <P><A name=P6202_1403574></A><FONT size=3>Chapter III.-Texts of Holy Scripture 
  Used by These Heretics to Support Their Opinions.</FONT></P></UL>
<P>1. Such, then, is the account they give of what took place within the 
Pleroma; such the calamities that flowed from the passion which seized upon the 
Aeon who has been named, and who was within a little of perishing by being 
absorbed in the universal substance, through her inquisitive searching after the 
Father; such the consolidation 
[of that Aeon] from her condition of agony by Horos, and Stauros, and Lytrotes, 
and Carpistes, and Horothetes, and Metagoges.
Such also is the account of the generation of the later Aeons, namely of the 
first Christ and of the Holy Spirit, both of whom were produced by the Father 
after the repentance
[of Sophia], and of the second
Christ (whom they also style Saviour), who owed his being to the joint 
contributions [of the Aeons]. They tell us, however, that this knowledge has not 
been openly divulged, because all are not capable of receiving it, but has been 
mystically revealed by the Saviour through means of parables to those qualified 
for understanding it. This has been done as follows. The thirty Aeons are 
indicated (as we have already remarked) by the thirty years during which they 
say the Saviour performed no public act, and by the parable of the labourers in 
the vineyard. Paul also, they affirm, very clearly and frequently names these 
Aeons, and even goes so far as to preserve their order, when he says, "To all 
the generations of the Aeons of the Aeon." 
Nay, we ourselves, when at the giving 
of thanks we pronounce the words, "To Aeons of Aeons" (for ever and ever), do 
set forth these Aeons. And, in fine, wherever the words Aeon or Aeons occur, 
they at once refer them to these beings.</P>
<P>2. The production, again, of the Duodecad of the Aeons, is indicated by the 
fact that the Lord was <I>twelve</I>
years of age when He disputed with the teachers of the law, and by the election 
of the apostles, for of these there were twelve.
The other eighteen Aeons are made manifest in this way: that the Lord, 
[according to them, ] conversed with His disciples for eighteen months
after His resurrection from the dead. They also affirm that these eighteen Aeons 
are strikingly indicated by the first two letters of His name [<FONT 
face=SPIonic>'Ihsou=j</FONT>], namely <I>Iota</I>
and Eta. And, in like manner, they assert that the ten Aeons are pointed out by 
the letter <I>Iota</I>, which begins His name; while, for the same reason, they 
tell us the Saviour said, "One <I>Iota</I>, or one tittle, shall by no means 
pass away until all be fulfilled."
</P>
<P>3. They further maintain that the passion which took place in the case of the 
twelfth Aeon is pointed at by the apostasy of Judas, who was the twelfth 
apostle, and also by the fact that Christ suffered in the twelfth month. For 
their opinion is, that He continued to preach for one year only after His 
baptism. The same thing is also most clearly indicated by the case of the woman 
who suffered from an issue of blood. For after she had been thus afflicted 
during twelve years, she was healed by the advent of the Saviour, when she had 
touched the border of His garment; and on this account the Saviour said, "Who 
touched me? " 
-teaching his disciples the mystery which had occurred among the Aeons, and the 
healing of that Aeon who had been involved in suffering. For she who had been 
afflicted twelve years represented that power whose essence, as they narrate, 
was stretching itself forth, and flowing into immensity; and unless she had 
touched the garment of the Son,
that is, Aletheia of the first Tetrad, who is denoted by the hem spoken of, she 
would have been dissolved into the general essence
[of which she participated]. She stopped short, however, and ceased any longer 
to suffer. For the power that went forth from the Son (and this power they term 
Horos) healed her, and separated the passion from her.</P>
<P>4. They moreover affirm that the Saviour
is shown to be derived from all the Aeons, and to be in Himself 
<I>everything</I> by the following passage: "Every male that openeth the womb."
For He, being everything, opened the womb
of the enthymesis of the suffering Aeon, when it had been expelled from the 
Pleroma. This they also style the second Ogdoad, of which we shall speak 
presently. And they state that it was clearly on this account that Paul said, 
"And He Himself is all things; "
and again, "All things are to Him, and of Him are all things; " 
and further, "In Him dwelleth all the fulness of the Godhead; "
and yet again, "All things are gathered together by God in Christ." 
Thus do they interpret these and any like passages to be found in Scripture.</P>
<P>5. They show, further, that that Horos of theirs, whom they call by a variety 
of names, has two faculties,-the one of supporting, and the other of separating; 
and in so far as he supports and sustains, he is Stauros, while in so far as he 
divides and separates, he is Horos. They then represent the Saviour as having 
indicated this twofold faculty: first, the sustaining power, when He said, 
"Whosoever doth not bear his cross (Stauros), and follow after me, cannot be my 
disciple; "
and again, "Taking up the cross follow me; "
but the separating power when He said, "I came not to send peace, but a 
word."
They also maintain that John indicated the same thing when he said, "The fan is 
in His hand, and He will thoroughly purge the floor, and will gather the wheat 
into His garner; but the chaff He will burn with fire unquenchable."
By this declaration He set forth the faculty of Horos. For that fan they explain 
to be the cross (Stauros), which consumes, no doubt, all material
objects, as fire does chaff, but it purifies all them that are saved, as a fan 
does wheat. Moreover, they affirm that the Apostle Paul himself made mention of 
this cross in the following words: "The doctrine of the cross is to them that 
perish foolishness, but to us who are saved it is the power of God."
And again: "God forbid that I should glory in anything
save in the cross of Christ, by whom the world is crucified to me, and I unto 
the world."</P>
<P>6. Such, then, is the account which they all give of their Pleroma, and of 
the formation
of the universe, striving, as they do, to adapt the good words of revelation to 
their own wicked inventions. And it is not only from the writings of the 
evangelists and the apostles that they endeavour to derive proofs for their 
opinions by means of perverse interpretations and deceitful expositions: they 
deal in the same way with the law and the prophets, which contain many parables 
and allegories that can frequently be drawn into various senses, according to 
the kind of exegesis to which they are subjected. And others
of them, with great craftiness, adapted such parts of Scripture to their own 
figments, lead away captive from the truth those who do not retain a stedfast 
faith in one God, the Father Almighty, and in one Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of 
God.</P>

  <P><A name=P6240_1413485></A><FONT size=3>Chapter IV.-Account Given by the 
  Heretics of the Formation of Achamoth; Origin of the Visible World from Her 
  Disturbances.</FONT></P></UL>
<P>1. The following are the transactions which they narrate as having occurred 
outside of the Pleroma: The enthymesis of that Sophia who dwells above, which 
they also term Achamoth,
being removed from the Pleroma, together with her passion, they relate to have, 
as a matter of course, become violently excited in those places of darkness and 
vacuity [to which she had been banished]. For she was excluded from light
and the Pleroma, and was without form or figure, like an untimely birth, because 
she had received nothing
[from a male parent]. But the Christ dwelling on high took pity upon her; and 
having extended himself through and beyond Stauros,
he imparted a figure to her, but merely as respected substance, and not so as to 
convey intelligence.
Having effected this, he withdrew his influence, and returned, leaving Achamoth 
to herself, in order that she, becoming sensible of her suffering as being 
severed from the Pleroma, might be influenced by the desire of better things, 
while she possessed in the meantime a kind of odour of immortality left in her 
by Christ and the Holy Spirit. Wherefore also she is called by two names-Sophia 
after her father (for Sophia is spoken of as being her father), and Holy Spirit 
from that Spirit who is along with Christ. Having then obtained a form, along 
with intelligence, and being immediately deserted by that Logos who had been 
invisibly present with her-that is, by Christ-she strained herself to discover 
that light which had forsaken her, but could not effect her purpose, inasmuch as 
she was prevented by Horos. And as Horos thus obstructed her further progress, 
he exclaimed, Iao,
whence, they say, this name <I>Iao</I> derived its origin. And when she could 
not pass by Horos on account of that passion in which she had been involved, and 
because she alone had been left without, she then resigned herself to every sort 
of that manifold and varied state of passion to which she was subject; and thus 
she suffered grief on the one hand because she had not obtained the object of 
her desire, and fear on the other hand, lest life itself should fail her, as 
light had already done, while, in addition, she was in the greatest perplexity. 
All these feelings were associated with ignorance. And this ignorance of hers 
was not like that of her mother, the first Sophia, an Aeon, due to degeneracy by 
means of passion, but to an [innate] opposition [of nature to knowledge].
Moreover, another kind of passion fell upon her her (Achamoth), namely, that of 
desiring to return to him who gave her life.</P>
<P>2. This collection [of passions] they declare was the substance of the matter 
from which this world was formed. For from [her desire of] returning [to him who 
gave her life], every soul belonging to this world, and that of the 
Demiurge 
himself, derived its origin. All other things owed their beginning to her terror 
and sorrow. For from her tears all that is of a liquid nature was formed; from 
her smile all that is lucent; and from her grief and perplexity all the 
corporeal elements of the world. For at one time, as they affirm, she would weep 
and lament on account of being left alone in the midst of darkness and vacuity; 
while, at another time, reflecting on the light which had forsaken her, she 
would be filled with joy, and laugh; then, again, she would be struck with 
terror; or, at other times, would sink into consternation and bewilderment.</P>
<P>3. Now what follows from all this? No light tragedy comes out of it, as the 
fancy of every man among them pompously explains, one in one way, and another in 
another, from what kind of passion and from what element being derived its 
origin. They have good reason, as seems to me, why they should not feel inclined 
to teach these things to all in public, but only to such as are able to pay a 
high price for an acquaintance with such profound mysteries. For these doctrines 
are not at all similar to those of which our Lord said, "Freely ye have 
received, freely give."
They are, on the contrary, abstruse, and portentous, and profound mysteries, to 
be got at only with great labour by such as are in love with falsehood. For who 
would not expend lull that he possessed, if only he might learn in return, that 
from the tears of the enthymesis of the Aeon involved in passion, seas, and 
fountains, and rivers, and every liquid substance derived its origin; that light 
burst forth from her smile; and that from her perplexity and consternation the 
corporeal elements of the world had their formation?</P>
<P>4. I feel somewhat inclined myself to contribute a few hints towards the 
development of their system. For when I perceive that waters are in part fresh, 
such as fountains, rivers, showers, and so on, and in part salt; such as those 
in the sea, I reflect with myself that all such waters cannot be derived from 
her tears, inasmuch as these are of a saline quality only. It is clear, 
therefore, that the waters which are salt are alone those which are derived from 
her tears. But it is probable that she, in her intense agony and perplexity, was 
covered with perspiration. And hence, following out their notion, we may 
conceive that fountains and rivers, and all the fresh water in the world, are 
due to this source. For it is difficult, since we know that all tears are of the 
same quality, to believe that waters both salt and fresh proceeded from them. 
The more plausible supposition is, that some are from her tears, and some from 
her perspiration. And since there are also in the world certain waters which are 
hot and acrid in their nature, thou must be left to guess their origin, how and 
whence. Such are some of the results of their hypothesis.</P>
<P>5. They go on to state that, when the mother Achamoth had passed through all 
sorts of passion, and had with difficulty escaped from them, she turned herself 
to supplicate the light which had forsaken her, that is, Christ. He, however, 
having returned to the Pleroma, and being probably unwilling again to descend 
from it, sent forth to her the Paraclete, that is, the Saviour.
This being was endowed with all power by the Father, who placed everything under 
his authority, the Aeons 
doing so likewise, so that "by him were all things, visible and invisible, 
created, thrones, divinities, dominions."
He then was sent to her along with his contemporary angels. And they related 
that Achamoth, filled with reverence, at first veiled herself through modesty, 
but that by and by, when she had looked upon him with all his endowments, and 
had acquired strength from his appearance, she ran forward to meet him. He then 
imparted to her form as respected intelligence, and brought healing to her 
passions, separating them from her, but not so as to drive them out of thought 
altogether. For it was not possible that they should be annihilated as in the 
former case,
because they had already taken root and acquired strength [so as to possess an 
indestructible existence]. All that he could do was to separate them and set 
them apart, and then commingle and condense them, so as to transmute them from 
incorporeal passion into unorganized matter.
He then by this process conferred upon them a fitness and a nature to become 
concretions and corporeal structures, in order that two substances should be 
formed,-the one evil, resulting from the passions, and the other subject indeed 
to suffering, but originating from her conversion. And on this account (i.e., on 
account of this hypostatizing of ideal matter) they say that the Saviour 
virtually
created the world. But when Achamoth was freed from her passion, she gazed with 
rapture on the dazzling vision of the angels that were with him; and in her 
ecstasy, conceiving by them, they tell us that she brought forth new beings, 
partly after her oven image, and partly a spiritual progeny after the image of 
the Saviour's attendants.</P>
<UL>
  <P><A name=P6262_1423084></A><FONT size=3>Chapter V.-Formation of the 
  Demiurge; Description of Him. He is the Creator of Everything Outside of the 
  Pleroma.</FONT></P></UL>
<P>1. These three kinds of existence, then, having, according to them, been now 
formed,-one from the passion, which was matter; a second from the conversion, 
which was animal; and the third, that which she (Achamoth) herself brought 
forth, which was spiritual,-she next addressed herself to the task of giving 
these form. But she could not succeed in doing this as respected the spiritual 
existence, because it was of the same nature with herself. She therefore applied 
herself to give form to the animal substance which had proceeded from her own 
conversion, and to bring forth to light the instructions of the Saviour. 
And they say she first formed out of animal substance him who is Father and King 
of all things, both of these which are of the same nature with himself, that is, 
animal substances, which they also call right-handed, and those which sprang 
from the passion, and from matter, which they call left-handed. For they affirm 
that he formed all the things which came into existence after him, being 
secretly impelled thereto by his mother. From this circumstance they style him 
Metropator,
Apator, Demiurge, and Father, saying that he is Father of the substances on the 
right hand, that is, of the animal, but Demiurge of those on the left, that is, 
of the material, while he is at the same time the king of all. For they say that 
this Enthymesis, desirous of making all things to the honour of the Aeons, 
formed images of them, or rather that the Saviour
did so through her instrumentality. And she, in the image
of the invisible Father, kept herself concealed from the Demiurge. But he was in 
the image of the only-begotten Son, and the angels and archangels created by him 
were in the image of the rest of the Aeons.</P>
<P>2. They affirm, therefore, that he was constituted the Father and God of 
everything outside of the Pleroma, being the creator of all animal and material 
substances. For he it was that discriminated these two kinds of existence 
hitherto confused, and made corporeal from incorporeal substances, fashioned 
things heavenly and earthly, and became the Framer (Demiurge) of things material 
and animal, of those on the right and those on the left, of the light and of the 
heavy, and of those tending upwards as well as of those tending downwards. He 
created also seven heavens, above which they say that he, the Demiurge, exists. 
And on this account they term him Hebdomas, and his mother Achamoth Ogdoads, 
preserving the number of the first-begotten and primary Ogdoad as the Pleroma. 
They affirm, moreover, that these seven heavens are intelligent, and speak of 
them as being angels, while they refer to the Demiurge himself as being an angel 
bearing a likeness to God; and in the same strain, they declare that Paradise, 
situated above the third heaven, is a fourth angel possessed of power, from whom 
Adam derived certain qualities while he conversed with him.</P>
<P>3. They go on to say that the Demiurge imagined that he created all these 
things of himself, while he in reality made them in conjunction with the 
productive power of Achamoth. He formed the heavens, yet was ignorant of the 
heavens; he fashioned man, yet knew not man; he brought to light the earth, yet 
had no acquaintance with the earth; and, in like manner. they declare that he 
was ignorant of the forms of all that he made, and knew not even of the 
existence of his own mother, but imagined that he himself was all things. They 
further affirm that his mother originated this opinion in his mind, because she 
desired to bring him forth possessed of such a character that he should be the 
head and source of his own essence, and the absolute ruler over every kind of 
operation [that was afterwards attempted]. This mother they also call Ogdoad, 
Sophia; Terra, Jerusalem, Holy Spirit, and, with a masculine reference, 
Lord.
Her place of habitation is an intermediate one, above the Demiurge indeed, but 
below and outside of the Pleroma, even to the end.
</P>
<P>4. As, then, they represent all material substance to be formed from three 
passions, viz., fear, grief, and perplexity, the account they give is as 
follows: Animal substances originated from fear and from conversion; the 
Demiurge they also describe as owing his origin to conversion; but the existence 
of all the other animal substances they ascribe to fear, such as the souls of 
irrational animals, and of wild beasts, and men. And on this account, he (the 
Demiurge), being incapable of recognising any spiritual essences, imagined 
himself to be God alone, and declared through the prophets, "I am God, and 
besides me there is none else."
They further teach that the spirits of wickedness derived their origin from 
grief. Hence the devil, whom they also call Cosmocrator (the ruler of the 
world), and the demons, and the angels, and every wicked spiritual being that 
exists, found the source Of their existence. They represent the Demiurge as 
being the son of that mother of theirs (Achamoth), and Cosmocrator as the 
creature of the Demiurge. Cosmocrator has knowledge of what is above himself, 
because he is a <I>spirit</I> of wickedness; but the Demiurge is ignorant of 
such things, inasmuch as he is merely <I>animal</I>. Their mother dwells in that 
place which is above the heavens, that is, in the intermediate abode; the 
Demiurge in the heavenly place, that is, in the hebdomad; but the Cosmocrator in 
this our world. The corporeal elements of the world, again, sprang, as we before 
remarked, from bewilderment and perplexity, as from a more ignoble source. Thus 
the earth arose from her state of stupor; water from the agitation caused by her 
fear; air from the consolidation of her grief; while fire, producing death and 
corruption, was inherent in all these elements, even as they teach that 
ignorance also lay concealed in these three passions.</P>
<P>5. Having thus formed the world, he (the Demiurge) also created the earthy 
[part of] man, not taking him from this dry earth, but from an invisible 
substance consisting of fusible and fluid matter, and then afterwards, as they 
define the process, breathed into him the animal part of his nature. It was this 
latter which was created after his image and likeness. The material part, 
indeed, was very near to. God, so far as the image went, but not of the same 
substance with him. The animal, on the Other hand, was so in respect to 
likeness; and hence his substance was called the spirit of life, because it took 
its rise from a spiritual outflowing. After all this, he was, they say, 
enveloped all round with a covering of skin; and by this they mean the outward 
sensitive flesh.</P>
<P>6. But they further affirm that the Demiurge himself was ignorant of that 
offspring of his mother Achamoth, which she brought forth as a consequence of 
her contemplation of those angels who waited on the Saviour, and which was, like 
herself, of a spiritual nature. She took advantage of this ignorance to deposit 
it (her production) in him without his knowledge, in order that, being by his 
instrumentality infused into that animal soul proceeding from himself, and being 
thus carried as in a womb in this material body, while it gradually increased in 
strength, might in course of time become fitted for the reception of perfect 
rationality.
Thus it came to pass, then, according to them, that, without any knowledge on 
the part of the Demiurge, the man formed by his inspiration was at the same 
time, through an unspeakable providence, rendered a spiritual man by the 
simultaneous inspiration received from Sophia. For, as he was ignorant of his 
mother, so neither did he recognise her offspring. This [offspring] they also 
declare to be the Ecclesia, an emblem of the Ecclesia which is above. This, 
then, is the kind of man whom they conceive of: he has his animal soul from the 
Demiurge, his body from the earth, his fleshy part from matter, and his 
spiritual man from the mother Achamoth.</P>

  Man Feigned by These Heretics: Good Works Needless for Them, Though Necessary 
  to Others: Their Abandoned Morals.</FONT></P></UL>
<P>1. There being thus three kinds of substances, they declare of all that is 
material (which they also describe as being "on the left hand") that it must of 
necessity perish, inasmuch as it is incapable of receiving any <I>afflatus</I> 
of incorruption. As to every animal existence (which they also denominate "on 
the right hand"), they hold that, inasmuch as it is a mean between the spiritual 
and the material, it passes to the side to which inclination draws it. Spiritual 
substance, again, they describe as having been sent forth for this end, that, 
being here united with that which is animal, it might assume shape, the two 
elements being simultaneously subjected to the same discipline. And this they 
declare to be "the salt" 
and "the light of the world." For the animal substance had need of training by 
means of the outward senses; and on this account they affirm that the world was 
created, as well as that the Saviour came to the animal substance (which was 
possessed of free-will), that He might secure for it salvation. For they affirm 
that He received the first-fruits of those whom He was to save [as follows], 
from Achamoth that which was spiritual, while He was invested by the Demiurge 
with the animal Christ, but was begirt
by a [special] dispensation with a body endowed with an animal nature, yet 
constructed with unspeakable skill, so that it might be visible and tangible, 
and capable of enduring suffering. At the same time, they deny that He assumed 
anything material [into His nature], since indeed matter is incapable of 
salvation. They further hold that the consummation of all things will take place 
when all that is spiritual has been formed and perfected by Gnosis (knowledge); 
and by this they mean spiritual men who have attained to the perfect knowledge 
of God, and been initiated into these mysteries by Achamoth. And they represent 
themselves to be these persons.</P>
<P>2. Animal men, again, are instructed in animal things; such men, namely, as 
are established by their works, and by a mere faith, while they have not perfect 
knowledge. We of the Church, they say, are these persons.
Wherefore also they maintain that good works are necessary to us, for that 
otherwise it is impossible we should be saved. But as to themselves, they hold 
that they shall be entirely and undoubtedly saved, not by means of conduct, but 
because they are spiritual by nature.
For, just as it is impossible that material substance should partake of 
salvation (since, indeed, they maintain that it is incapable of receiving it), 
so again it is impossible that spiritual substance (by which they mean 
themselves) should ever come under the power of corruption, whatever the sort of 
actions in which they indulged. For even as gold, when submersed in filth, loses 
not on that account its beauty, but retains its own native qualities, the filth 
having no power to injure the gold, so they affirm that they cannot in any 
measure suffer hurt, or lose their spiritual substance, whatever the material 
actions in which they may be involved.</P>
<P>3. Wherefore also it comes to pass, that the "most perfect" among them addict 
themselves without fear to all those kinds of forbidden deeds of which the 
Scriptures assure us that "they who do such things shall not inherit the kingdom 
of God."
For instance, they make no scruple about eating meats offered in sacrifice to 
idols, imagining that they can in this way contract no defilement. Then, again, 
at every heathen festival celebrated in honour of the idols, these men are the 
first to assemble; and to such a pitch do they go, that some of them do not even 
keep away from that bloody spectacle hateful both to God and men, in which 
gladiators either fight with wild beasts, or singly encounter one another. 
Others of them yield themselves up to the lusts of the flesh with the utmost 
greediness, maintaining that carnal things should be allowed to the carnal 
nature, while spiritual things are provided for the spiritual. Some of them, 
moreover, are in the habit of defiling those women to whom they have taught the 
above doctrine, as has frequently been confessed by those women who have been 
led astray by certain of them, on their returning to the Church of God, and 
acknowledging this along with the rest of their errors. Others of them, too, 
openly and without a blush, having become passionately attached to certain 
women, seduce them away from their husbands, and contract marriages of their own 
with them. Others of them, again, who pretend at first. to live in all modesty 
with them as with sisters, have in course of time been revealed in their true 
colours, when the sister has been found with child by her [pretended] 
brother.</P>
<P>4. And committing many other abominations and impieties, they run us down 
(who from the fear of God guard against sinning even in thought or word) as 
utterly contemptible and ignorant persons, while they highly exalt themselves, 
and claim to be perfect, and the elect seed. For they declare that we simply 
receive grace for use, wherefore also it will again be taken away from us; but 
that they themselves have grace as their own special possession, which has 
descended from above by means of an unspeakable and indescribable conjunction; 
and on this account more will be given them.
They maintain, therefore, that in every way it is always necessary for them to 
practise the mystery of conjunction. And that they may persuade the thoughtless 
to believe this, they are in the habit of using these very words, "Whosoever 
being <I>in</I> this world does not so love a woman as to obtain possession of 
her, is not of the truth, nor shall attain to the truth. But whosoever being 
<I>of</I> this world has intercourse with woman, shall not attain to the truth, because he 
has so acted under the power of concupiscence." On this account, they tell us 
that it is necessary for us whom they call <I>animal</I> men, and describe as 
being <I>of</I> the world, to practise continence and good works, that by this 
means we may attain at length to the intermediate habitation, but that to them 
who are called "the spiritual and perfect" such a course of conduct is not at 
all necessary. For it is not conduct of any kind which leads into the Pleroma, 
but the seed sent forth thence in a feeble, immature state, and here brought to 
perfection.</P>

<P>1. When all the seed shall have come to perfection, they state that then 
their mother Achamoth shall pass from the intermediate place, and enter in 
within the Pleroma, and shall receive as her spouse the Saviour, who sprang from 
all the Aeons, that thus a conjunction may be formed between the Saviour and 
Sophia, that is, Achamoth. These, then, are the bridegroom and bride, while the 
nuptial chamber is the full extent of the Pleroma. The spiritual seed, again, 
being divested of their animal souls,
and becoming intelligent spirits, shall in an irresistible and invisible manner 
enter in within the Pleroma, and be bestowed as brides on those angels who wait 
upon the Saviour. The Demiurge himself will pass into the place of his mother 
Sophia;
that is, the intermediate habitation. In this intermediate place, also, shall 
the souls of the righteous repose; but nothing of an animal nature shall find 
admittance to the Pleroma. When these things have taken place as described, then 
shall that fire which lies hidden in the world blaze forth and bum; and while 
destroying all matter, shall also be extinguished along with it, and have no 
further existence. They affirm that the Demiurge was acquainted with none of 
these things before the advent of the Saviour.</P>
<P>2. There are also some who maintain that he also produced Christ as his own 
proper son, but of an animal nature, and that mention was 
made of him by the prophets. This Christ passed through Mary 
just as water flows through a tube; and there descended upon him in the form of 
a dove it the time of his baptism, that Saviour who belonged to the Pleroma, and 
was formed by the combined efforts of all its inhabit ants. In him there existed 
also that spiritual seed which proceeded from Achamoth. They hold, accordingly, 
that our Lord, while preserving the type of the first-begotten and primary 
tetrad, was compounded of these four substances,-of that which is spiritual, in 
so far as He was from Achamoth; of that which is animal, as being from the 
Demiurge by a special dispensation, inasmuch as He was formed [corporeally] with 
unspeakable skill; and of the Saviour, as respects that dove which descended 
upon Him. He also continued free from all suffering, since indeed it was not 
possible that He should suffer who was at once incomprehensible and invisible. 
And for this reason the Spirit of Christ, who had been placed within Him, was 
taken away when He was brought before Pilate. They maintain, further, that not 
even the seed which He had received from the mother [Achamoth] was subject to 
suffering; for it, too, was impassible, as being spiritual, and invisible even 
to the Demiurge himself. It follows, then, according to them, that the animal 
Christ, and that which had been formed mysteriously by a special dispensation, 
underwent suffering, that the mother might exhibit through him a type of the 
Christ above, namely, of him who extended himself through Stauros, 
and imparted to Achamoth shape, so far as substance was concerned. For they 
declare that all these transactions were counterparts of what took place 
above.</P>
<P>3. They maintain, moreover, that those souls which possess the seed of 
Achamoth are superior to the rest, and are more dearly loved by the Demiurge 
than others, while he knows not the true cause thereof, but imagines that they 
are what they are through his favour towards them. Wherefore, also, they say he 
distributed them to prophets, priests, and kings; and they declare that many 
things were spoken
by this seed through the prophets, inasmuch as it was endowed with a 
transcendently lofty nature. The mother also, they say, spake much about things 
above, and that both through him and through the souls which were formed by him. 
Then, again, they divide the prophecies [into different classes], maintaining 
that one portion was uttered by the mother, a second by her seed, and a third by 
the Demiurge. In like manner, they hold that Jesus uttered some things under the 
influence of the Saviour, others under that of the mother, and others still 
under that of the Demiurge, as we shall show further on in our work.</P>
<P>4. The Demiurge, while ignorant of those things which were higher than 
himself, was indeed excited by the announcements made [through the prophets], 
but treated them with contempt, attributing them sometimes to one cause and 
sometimes to another; either to the prophetic spirit (which itself possesses the 
power of self-excitement), or to [mere unassisted] man, or that it was simply a 
crafty device of the lower [and baser order of men].
He remained thus ignorant until the appearing of the Lord. But they relate that 
when the Saviour came, the Demiurge learned all things from Him, and gladly with 
all, his power joined himself to Him. They maintain that he is the centurion 
mentioned in the Gospel, who addressed the Saviour in these words: "For I also 
am one having soldiers and servants under my authority; and whatsoever I command 
they do."
They further hold that he will continue administering the affairs of the world 
as long as that is fitting and needful, and specially that he may exercise a 
care over the Church; while at the same time he is influenced by the knowledge 
of the reward prepared for him, namely, that he may attain to the habitation of 
his mother.</P>
<P>5. They conceive, then, of three kinds of men, spiritual, material, and 
animal, represented by Cain, Abel, and Seth. These three natures are no longer 
found in one person,
but constitute various kinds [of men]. The material goes, as a matter of course, 
into corruption. The animal, if it make choice of the better part, finds repose 
in the intermediate place; but if the worse, it too shall pass into destruction. 
But they assert that the spiritual principles which have been sown by Achamoth, 
being disciplined and nourished here from that time until now in righteous souls 
(because when given forth by her they were yet but weak), at last attaining to 
perfection, shall be given as brides to the angels of the Saviour, while their 
animal souls of necessity rest for ever with the Demiurge in the intermediate 
place. And again subdividing the animal souls themselves, they say that some are 
by nature good, and others by nature evil. The good are those who become capable 
of receiving the [spiritual] seed; the evil by nature are those who are never 
able to receive that seed.</P>

  Pervert the Scriptures to Support Their Own Pious Opinions.</FONT></P></UL>
<P>1. Such, then, is their system, which neither the prophets announced, nor the 
Lord taught, nor the apostles delivered, but of which they boast that beyond all 
others they have a perfect knowledge. They gather their views from other sources 
than the Scriptures;
and, to use a common proverb, they strive to weave ropes of sand, while they 
endeavour to adapt with an air of probability to their own peculiar assertions 
the parables of the Lord, the sayings of the prophets, and the words of the 
apostles, in order that their scheme may not seem altogether without support. In 
doing so, however, they disregard the order and the connection of the 
Scriptures, and so far as in them lies, dismember and destroy the truth. By 
transferring passages, and dressing them up anew, and making one thing out of 
another, they succeed in deluding many through their wicked art in adapting the 
oracles of the Lord to their opinions. Their manner of acting is just as if one, 
when a beautiful image of a king has been constructed by some skilful artist out 
of precious jewels, should then take this likeness of the man all to pieces, 
should rearrange the gems, and so fit them together as to make them into the 
form of a dog or of a fox, and even that but poorly executed; and should then 
maintain and declare that <I>this</I> was the beautiful image of the king which 
the skilful artist constructed, pointing to the jewels which had been admirably 
fitted together by the first artist to form the image of the king, but have been 
with bad effect transferred by the latter one to the shape of a dog, and by thus 
exhibiting the jewels, should deceive the ignorant who had no conception what a 
king's form was like, and persuade them that that miserable likeness of the fox 
was, in fact, the beautiful image of the king. In like manner do these persons 
patch together old wives' fables, and then endeavour, by violently drawing away 
from their proper connection, words, expressions, and parables whenever found, 
to adapt the oracles of God to their baseless fictions. We have already stated 
how far they proceed in this way with respect to the interior of the 
Pleroma.</P>
<P>2. Then, again, as to those things outside of their Pleroma, the following 
are some specimens of what they attempt to accommodate out of the Scriptures to 
their opinions. They affirm that the Lord came in the last times of the world to 
endure suffering, for this end, that He might indicate the passion which 
occurred to the last of the Aeons, and might by His own end announce the 
cessation of that disturbance which had risen among the Aeons. They maintain, 
further, that that girl of twelve years old, the daughter of the ruler of the 
synagogue,
to whom the Lord approached and raised her from the dead, was a type of 
Achamoth, to whom their Christ, by extending himself, imparted shape, and whom 
he led anew to the perception of that light which had forsaken her. And that the 
Saviour appeared to her when she lay outside of the Pleroma as a kind of 
abortion, they affirm Paul to have declared in his Epistle to the Corinthians 
[in these words], "And last of all, He appeared to me also, as to one born out 
of due time."
Again, the coming of the Saviour with His attendants to Achamoth is declared in 
like manner by him in the same Epistle, when he says, "A woman ought to have a 
veil upon her head, because of the angels."
Now, that Achamoth, when the Saviour came to her, drew a veil over herself 
through modesty, Moses rendered manifest when he put a veil upon his face. Then, 
also, they say that the passions which she endured were indicated by the Lord 
upon the cross. Thus, when He said, "My God, my God, why hast Thou forsaken Me?"
He simply showed that Sophia was deserted by the light, and was restrained by 
Horos from making any advance forward. Her anguish, again, was indicated when He 
said, "My soul is exceeding sorrowful, even unto death; "
her fear by the words, "Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from Me;"
and her perplexity, too, when He said, "And what I shall say, I know 
not."
</P>
<P>3. And they teach that He pointed out the three kinds of men as follows: the 
<I>material</I>, when He said to him that asked Him, "Shall I follow Thee? "
"The Son of man hath not where to lay His head; "-the <I>animal</I>, when He 
said to him that declared, "I will follow Thee, but suffer me first to bid them 
farewell that are in my house," "No man, putting his hand to the plough, and 
looking back, is fit for the kingdom of heaven"
(for this man they declare to be of the intermediate class, even as they do that 
other who, though he professed to have wrought a large amount of righteousness, 
yet refused to follow Him, and was so overcome by [the love of] riches, as never 
to reach perfection)-this one it pleases them to place in the animal class;-the 
<I>spiritual</I>, again, when He said, "Let the dead bury their dead, but go 
thou and preach the kingdom of God,"
and when He said to Zaccheus the publican, "Make haste, and come down, for 
to-day I must abide in thine house"
-for these they declared to have belonged to the spiritual class. Also the 
parable of the leaven which the woman is described as having hid in three 
measures of meal, they declare to make manifest the three classes. For, 
according to their teaching, the woman represented Sophia; the three measures of 
meal, the three kinds of men-spiritual, animal, and material; while the leaven 
denoted the Saviour Himself. Paul, too, very plainly set forth the material, 
animal, and spiritual, saying in one place, "As is the earthy, such are they 
also that are earthy; " 
and in another place, "But the animal man receiveth not the things of the 
Spirit;" and again: "He that is spiritual judgeth all things."
And this, "The animal man receiveth not the things of the Spirit," they affirm 
to have been spoken concerning the Demiurge, who, as being animal, knew neither 
his mother who was spiritual, nor her seed, nor the Aeons in the Pleroma. And 
that the Saviour received first-fruits of those whom He was to save, Paul 
declared when he said, "And if the first-fruits be holy, the lump is also holy,"
teaching that the expression "first-fruits" denoted that which is spiritual, but 
that "the lump" meant us, that is, the animal Church, the lump of which they say 
He assumed, and blended it with Himself, inasmuch as He is "the leaven."</P>
<P>4. Moreover, that Achamoth wandered beyond the Pleroma, and received form 
from Christ, and was sought after by the Saviour, they declare that He indicated 
when He said, that He had come after that sheep which was gone astray.
For they explain the wandering sheep to mean their mother, by whom they 
represent the Church as having been sown. The wandering itself denotes her stay 
outside of the Pleroma in a state of varied passion, from which they maintain 
that matter derived its origin. The woman, again, who sweeps the house and finds 
the piece of money, they declare to denote the Sophia above, who, having lost 
her enthymesis, afterwards recovered it, on all things being purified by the 
advent of the Saviour. Wherefore this substance also, according to them, was 
reinstated in Pleroma. They say, too, that Simeon, "who took Christ into his 
arms, and gave thanks to God, and said, Lord, now lettest Thou Thy servant 
depart in peace, according to Thy word," 
was a type of the Demiurge, who, on the arrival of the Saviour, learned his own 
change of place, and gave thanks to Bythus. They also assert that by Anna, who 
is spoken of in the gospel
as a prophetess, and who, after living seven years with her husband, passed all 
the rest of her life in widowhood until she saw the Saviour, and recognised Him, 
and spoke of Him to all, was most plainly indicated Achamoth, who, having for a 
little while looked upon the Saviour with His associates, and dwelling all the 
rest of the time in the intermediate place, waited for Him till He should come 
again, and restore her to her proper consort. Her name, too, was indicated by 
the Saviour, when He said, "Yet wisdom is justified by her children."
This, too, was done by Paul in these words," But we speak wisdom among them that 
are perfect." 
They declare also that Paul has referred to the conjunctions within the Pleroma, 
showing them forth by means of one; for, when writing of the conjugal union in 
this life, he expressed himself thus: "This is a great mystery, but I speak 
concerning Christ and the Church." 
</P>
<P>5. Further, they teach that John, the disciple of the Lord, indicated the 
first Ogdoad, expressing themselves in these words: John, the disciple of the 
Lord, wishing to set forth the origin of all things, so as to explain how the 
Father produced the whole, lays down a certain principle,-that, namely, which 
was first-begotten by God, which Being he has termed both the only-begotten Son 
and God, in whom the Father, after a seminal manner, brought forth all things. 
By him the Word was produced, and in him the whole substance of the Aeons, to 
which the Word himself afterwards imparted form. Since, therefore, he treats of 
the first origin of things, he rightly proceeds in his teaching from the 
beginning, that is, from God and the Word. And he expresses himself thus: "In 
the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God; the 
same was in the beginning with God." 
Having first of all distinguished these three-God, the Beginning, and the 
Word-he again unites them, that he may exhibit the production of each of them, 
that is, of the Son and of the Word, and may at the same time show their union 
with one another, and with the Father. For "the beginning" is in the Father, and 
of the Father, while "the Word" is in the beginning, and of the beginning. Very 
properly, then, did he say, "In the beginning was the Word," for He was in the 
Son; "and the Word was with God," for He was the beginning; "and the Word was 
God," of course, for that which is begotten of God is God. "The same was in the 
beginning with God"-this clause discloses the order of production. "All things 
were made by Him, and without Him was nothing made; "
for the Word was the author of form and beginning to all the Aeons that came 
into existence after Him. But "what was made in Him," says John, "is 
life." 
Here again he indicated conjunction; for all things, he said, were made 
<I>by</I> Him, but <I>in</I> Him was life. This, then, which is in Him, is more 
closely connected with Him than those things which were simply made by Him, for 
it exists along with Him, and is developed by Him. When, again, he adds, "And 
the life was the light of men," while thus mentioning Anthropos, he indicated 
also Ecclesia by that one expression, in order that, by using only one name, he 
might disclose their fellowship with one another, in virtue of their 
conjunction. For Anthropos and Ecclesia spring from Logos and Zoe. Moreover, he 
styled life (Zoe) the light of men, because they are enlightened by her, that 
is, formed and made manifest. This also Paul declares in these words: "For 
whatsoever doth make manifest is light."
Since, therefore, Zoe manifested and begat both Anthropos and Ecclesia, she is 
termed their light. Thus, then, did John by these words reveal both other things 
and the second Tetrad, Logos and Zoe, Anthropos and Ecclesia. And still further, 
he also indicated the first Tetrad. For, in discoursing of the Saviour and 
declaring that all things beyond the Pleroma received form from Him, he says 
that He is the fruit of the entire Pleroma. For he styles Him a "light which 
shineth in darkness, and which was not comprehended"
by it, inasmuch as, when He imparted form to all those things which had their 
origin from passion, He was not known by it.
He also styles Him Son, and Aletheia, and Zoe, and the "Word made flesh, whose 
glory," he says, "we beheld; and His glory was as that of the Only-begotten 
(given to Him by the Father), full of grace and truth."
(But what John really does say is this: "And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt 
among us; and we beheld His glory, the glory as of the only-begotten of the 
Father, full of grace and truth." 
) Thus, then, does he [according to them] distinctly set forth the first Tetrad, 
when he speaks of the Father, and Charis, and Monogenes, and Aletheia. In this 
way, too, does John tell of the first Ogdoad, and that which is the mother of 
all the Aeons. For he mentions the Father, and Charis, and Monogenes, and 
Aletheia, and Logos, and Zoe, and Anthropos, and Ecclesia. Such are the views of 
Ptolemaeus.

  <P><A name=P6345_1461744></A><FONT size=3>Chapter IX.-Refutation of the 
  Impious Interpretations of These Heretics.</FONT></P></UL>
<P>1. You see, my friend, the method which these men employ to deceive 
themselves, while they abuse the Scriptures by endeavouring to support their own 
system out of them. For this reason, I have brought forward their modes of 
expressing themselves, that thus thou mightest understand the deceitfulness of 
their procedure, and the wickedness of their error. For, in the first place, if 
it had been John's intention to set forth that Ogdoad above, he would surely 
have preserved the order of its production, and would doubtless have placed the 
primary Tetrad first as being, according to them, most venerable and would then 
have annexed the second, that, by the sequence of the names, the order of the 
Ogdoad might be exhibited, and not after so long an interval, as if forgetful 
for the moment and then again calling the matter to mind, he, last of all, made 
mention of the primary Tetrad. In the next place, if he had meant to indicate 
their conjunctions, he certainly would not have omitted the name of Ecclesia; 
while, with respect to the other conjunctions, he either would have been 
satisfied with the mention of the male [Aeons] (since the others [like Ecclesia] 
might be understood), so as to preserve a uniformity throughout; or if he 
enumerated the conjunctions of the rest, he would also have announced the spouse 
of Anthropos, and would not have left us to find out her name by divination.</P>
<P>2. The fallacy, then, of this exposition is manifest. For when John, 
proclaiming one God, the Almighty, and one Jesus Christ, the Only-begotten, by 
whom all things were made, declares that this was the Son of God, this the 
Only-begotten, this the Former of all things, this the true Light who 
enlighteneth every man this the Creator of the world, this He that came to His 
own, this He that became flesh and dwelt among us,-these men, by a plausible 
kind of exposition, perverting these statements, maintain that there was another 
Monogenes, according to production, whom they also style Arche. They also 
maintain that there was another Saviour, and another Logos, the son of 
Monogenes, and another Christ produced for the re-establishment of the Pleroma. 
Thus it is that, wresting from the truth every one of the expressions which have 
been cited, and taking a bad advantage of the names, they have transferred them 
to their own system; so that, according to them, in all these terms John makes 
no mention of the Lord Jesus Christ. For if he has named the Father, and Charis, 
and Monogenes, and Aletheia, and Logos, and Zoe, and Anthropos, and Ecclesia, 
according to their hypothesis, he has, by thus speaking, referred to the primary 
Ogdoad, in which there was as yet no Jesus, and no Christ, the teacher of John. 
But that the apostle did not speak concerning their conjunctions, but concerning 
our Lord Jesus Christ, whom he also acknowledges as the Word of God, he himself 
has made evident. For, summing up his statements respecting the Word previously 
mentioned by him, he further declares, "And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt 
among us." But, according to their hypothesis, the Word did not become flesh at 
all, inasmuch as He never went outside of the Pleroma, but that Saviour [became 
flesh] who was formed by a special dispensation [out of all the Aeons], and was 
of later date than the Word.</P>
<P>3. Learn then, ye foolish men, that Jesus who suffered for us, and who dwelt 
among us, is Himself the Word of God. For if any other of the Aeons had become 
flesh for our salvation, it would have been probable that the apostle spoke of 
another. But if the Word of the Father who descended is the same also that 
ascended, He, namely, the Only-begotten Son of the only God, who, according to 
the good pleasure of the Father, became flesh for the sake of men, the apostle 
certainly does not speak regarding any other, or concerning any Ogdoad, but 
respecting our Lord Jesus Christ. For, according to them, the Word did not 
originally become flesh. For they maintain that the Saviour assumed an animal 
body, formed in accordance with a special dispensation by an unspeakable 
providence, so as to become visible and palpable. But <I>flesh</I> is that which 
was of old formed for Adam by God out of the dust, and it is this that John has 
declared the Word of God became. Thus is their primary and first-begotten Ogdoad 
brought to nought. For, since Logos, and Monogenes, and Zoe, and <FONT 
face="Semitica Dict">Phos</FONT>, and Sorer, and Christus, and the Son of God, 
and He who became incarnate for us, have been proved to be one and the same, the 
Ogdoad which they have built up at once falls to pieces. And when this is 
destroyed, their whole system sinks into ruin,-a system which they falsely dream 
into existence, and thus inflict injury on the Scriptures, while they build up 
their own hypothesis.</P>
<P>4. Then, again, collecting a set of expressions and names scattered here and 
there [in Scripture], they twist them, as we have already said, from a natural 
to a non-natural sense. In so doing, they act like those who bring forward any 
kind of hypothesis they fancy, and then endeavour to support
them out of the poems of Homer, so that the ignorant imagine that Homer actually 
composed the verses bearing upon that hypothesis, which has, in fact, been but 
newly constructed; and many others are led so far by the regularly-formed 
sequence of the verses, as to doubt whether Homer may not have composed them. Of 
this kind
is the following passage, where one, describing Hercules as having been sent by 
Eurystheus to the dog in the infernal regions, does so by means of these Homeric 
verses,-for there can be no objection to our citing these by way of 
illustration, since the same sort of attempt appears in both:-</P>
<UL>
  <UL>
    <P>"Thus saying, there sent forth from his house deeply 
    groaning."-<I>Od.</I>, x. 76.</P>
    <P>"The hero Hercules conversant with mighty deeds."-<I>Od.</I>, xxi. 
26.</P>
    <P>"Eurystheus, the son of Sthenelus, descended from Perseus."-<I>Il.</I>, 
    xix. 123.</P>
    <P>"That he might bring from Erebus the dog of gloomy Pluto."-<I>Il.</I>,

    <P>"And he advanced like a mountain-bred lion confident of

    <P>"But Mercury and the blue-eyed Minerva conducted him."-<I>Od.</I>, xi. 
    626.</P>
    <P>"For she knew the mind of her brother, how it laboured with 
    grief."-<I>Il.</I>, ii. 409.</P></UL></UL>
<P>Now, what simple-minded man, I ask, would not be led away by such verses as 
these to think that Homer actually framed them so with reference to the subject 
indicated? But he who is acquainted with the Homeric writings will recognise the 
verses indeed, but not the subject to which they are applied, as knowing that 
some of them were spoken of Ulysses, others of Hercules himself, others still of 
Priam, and others again of Menelaus and Agamemnon. But if he takes them and 
restores each of them to its proper position, he at once destroys the narrative 
in question. In like manner he also who retains unchangeable
in his heart the rule of the truth which he received by means of baptism, will 
doubtless recognise the names, the expressions, and the parables taken from the 
Scriptures, but will by no means acknowledge the blasphemous use which these men 
make of them. For, though he will acknowledge the gems, he will certainly not 
receive the fox instead of the likeness of the king. But when he has restored 
every one of the expressions quoted to its proper position, and has fitted it to 
the body of the truth, he will lay bare, and prove to be without any foundation, 
the figment of these heretics.</P>
<P>5. But since what may prove a finishing-stroke
to this exhibition is wanting, so that any one, on following out their farce to 
the end, may then at once append an argument which shall overthrow it, we have 
judged it well to point out, first of all, in what respects the very fathers of 
this fable differ among themselves, as if they were inspired by different 
spirits of error. For this very fact forms an <I>a priori</I> proof that the 
truth proclaimed by the Church is immoveable,
and that the theories of these men are but a tissue of falsehoods.</P>
<UL>
  <P><A name=P6368_1470835></A><FONT size=3>Chapter X.-Unity of the Faith of the 
  Church Throughout the Whole World.</FONT></P></UL>
<P>1. The Church, though dispersed through our the whole world, even to the ends 
of the earth, has received from the apostles and their disciples this faith: 
[She believes] in one God, the Father Almighty, Maker of heaven, and earth, and 
the sea, and all things that are in them; and in one Christ Jesus, the Son of 
God, who became incarnate for our salvation; and in the Holy Spirit, who 
proclaimed through the prophets the dispensations
of God, and the advents, and the birth from a virgin, and the passion, and the 
resurrection from the dead, and the ascension into heaven in the flesh of the 
beloved Christ Jesus, our Lord, and His [future] manifestation from heaven in 
the glory of the Father "to gather all things in one,"
and to raise up anew all flesh of the whole human race, in order that to Christ 
Jesus, our Lord, and God, and Saviour, and King, according to the will of the 
invisible Father, "every knee should bow, of things in heaven, and things in 
earth, and things under the earth, and that every tongue should confess"
to Him, and that He should execute just judgment towards all; that He may send 
"spiritual wickednesses," 
and the angels who transgressed and became apostates, together with the ungodly, 
and unrighteous, and wicked, and profane among men, into everlasting fire; but 
may, in the exercise of His grace, confer immortality on the righteous, and 
holy, and those who have kept His commandments, and have persevered in His love, 
some from the beginning [of their Christian course], and others from [the date 
of] their repentance, and may surround them with everlasting glory.</P>
<P>2. As I have already observed, the Church, having received this preaching and 
this faith, although scattered throughout the whole world, yet, as if occupying 
but one house, carefully preserves it. She also believes these points [of 
doctrine] just as if she had but one soul, and one and the same heart, and she 
proclaims them, and teaches them, and hands them down, with perfect harmony, as 
if she possessed only one mouth. For, although the languages of the world are 
dissimilar, yet the import of the tradition is one and the same. For the 
Churches which have been planted in Germany do not believe or hand down anything 
different, nor do those in Spain, nor those in Gaul, nor those in the East, nor 
those in Egypt, nor those in Libya, nor those which have been established in the 
central regions 
of the world. But as the sun, that creature of God, is one and the same 
throughout the whole world, so also the preaching of the truth shineth 
everywhere, and enlightens all men that are willing to come to a knowledge of 
the truth. Nor will any one of the rulers in the Churches, however highly gifted 
he may be in point of eloquence, teach doctrines different from these (for no 
one is greater than the Master); nor, on the other hand, will he who is 
deficient in power of expression inflict injury on the tradition. For the faith 
being ever one and the same, neither does one who is able at great length to 
discourse regarding it, make any addition to it, nor does one, who can say but 
little diminish it.</P>
<P>3. It does not follow because men are endowed with greater and less degrees 
of intelligence, that they should therefore change the subject-matter [of the 
faith] itself, and should conceive of some other God besides Him who is the 
Framer, Maker, and Preserver of this universe, (as if He were not 
sufficient for them), or of another Christ, or another Only-begotten. But the fact referred 
to simply implies this, that one may [more accurately than another] bring out 
the meaning of those things which have been spoken in parables, and accommodate 
them to the general scheme of the faith; and explain [with special clearness] 
the operation and dispensation of God connected with human salvation; and show 
that God manifested longsuffering in regard to the apostasy of the angels who 
transgressed, as also with respect to the disobedience of men; and set forth why 
it is that one and the same God has made some things temporal and some eternal, 
some heavenly and others earthly; and understand for what reason God, though 
invisible, manifested Himself to the prophets not under one form, but 
differently to different individuals; and show why it was that more covenants 
than one were given to mankind; and teach what was the special character of each 
of these covenants; and search out for what reason "God
hath concluded every man
in unbelief, that He may have mercy upon all; "and gratefully
describe on what account the Word of God became flesh and suffered; and relate 
why the advent of the Son of God took place in these last times, that is, in the 
end, rather than in the beginning [of the world]; and unfold what is contained 
in the Scriptures concerning the end [itself], and things to come; and not be 
silent as to how it is that God has made the Gentiles, whose salvation was 
despaired of, fellow-heirs, and of the same body, and partakers with the saints; 
and discourse how it is that "this mortal body shall put on immortality, and 
this corruptible shall put on incorruption; "
and proclaim in what sense [God] says, "`That is a people who was not a people; 
and she is beloved who was not beloved; "
and in what sense He says that "more are the children of her that was desolate, 
than of her who possessed a husband."
For in reference to these points, and others of a like nature, the apostle 
exclaims: "Oh! the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of God; 
how unsearchable are His judgments, and His ways past finding out!"
But [the superior skill spoken of] is not found in this, that any one should, 
beyond the Creator and Framer [of the world], conceive of the Enthymesis of an 
erring Aeon, their mother and his, and should thus proceed to such a pitch of 
blasphemy; nor does it consist in this, that he should again falsely imagine, as 
being above this [fancied being], a Pleroma at one time supposed to contain 
thirty, and at another time an innumerable tribe of Aeons, as these teachers who 
are destitute of truly divine wisdom maintain; while the Catholic Church 
possesses one and the same faith throughout the whole world, as we have already 
said.</P>

are some two or three of them), how they do not agree in treating the same 
points, but alike, in things and names, set forth opinions mutually discordant. 
The first of them, Valentinus, who adapted the principles of the heresy called "Gnostic" 
to the peculiar character of his own school, taught as follows: He maintained 
that there is a certain Dyad (twofold being), who is inexpressible by any name, 
of whom one part should be called Arrhetus (unspeakable), and the other Sige 
(silence). But of this Dyad a second was produced, one part of whom he names 
Pater, and the other Aletheia. From this Tetrad, again, arose Logos and Zoe, 
Anthropos and Ecclesia. These constitute the primary Ogdoad. He next states that 
from Logos and Zoe ten powers were produced, as we have before mentioned. But 
from Anthropos and Ecclesia proceeded twelve, one of which separating from the 
rest, and falling from its original condition, produced the rest
of the universe. He also supposed two beings of the name of Horos, the one of 
whom has his place between Bythus and the rest of the Pleroma, and divides the 
created Aeons from the uncreated Father, while the other separates their mother 
from the Pleroma. Christ also was not produced from the Aeons within the 
Pleroma, but was brought forth by the mother who had been excluded from it, in 
virtue of her remembrance of better things, but not without a kind of shadow. 
He, indeed, as being masculine, having severed the shadow from himself, returned 
to the Pleroma; but his mother being left with the shadow, and deprived of her 
spiritual substance, brought forth another son, namely, the Demiurge, whom he 
also styles the supreme ruler of all those things which are subject to him. He 
also asserts that, along with the Demiurge, there was produced a left-hand 
power, in which particular he agrees with those falsely called Gnostics, of whom 
to we have yet to speak. Sometimes, again, he maintains that Jesus was produced 
from him who was separated from their mother, and united to the rest, that is, 
from Theletus, sometimes as springing from him who returned into the Pleroma, 
that is, from Christ; and at other times still as derived from Anthropos and 
Ecclesia. And he declares that the Holy Spirit was produced by Aletheia 
for the inspection and fructification of the Aeons, by entering invisibly into 
them, and that, in this way, the Aeons brought forth the plants of truth.</P>
<P>2. Secundus again affirms that the primary Ogdoad consists of a right hand 
and a left hand Tetrad, and teaches that the one of these is called light, and 
the other darkness. But he maintains that the power which separated from the 
rest, and fell away, did not proceed directly from the thirty Aeons, but from 
their fruits.</P>
<P>3. There is another,
who is a renowned teacher among them, and who, struggling to reach something 
more sublime, and to attain to a kind of higher knowledge, has explained the 
primary Tetrad as follows: There is [he says] a certain Proarche who existed 
before all things, surpassing all thought, speech, and nomenclature, whom I call 
Monotes (unity). Together with this Monotes there exists a power, which again I 
term Henotes (oneness). This Henotes and Monotes, being one, produced, yet not 
so as to bring forth [apart from themselves, as an emanation] the beginning of 
all things, an intelligent, unbegotten, and invisible being, which beginning 
language terms "Monad." With this Monad there co-exists a power of the same 
essence, which again I term Hen (One). These powers then-Monotes, and Henotes, 
and Monas, and Hen-produced the remaining company of the Aeons.</P>
<P>4. Iu, Iu! Pheu, Pheu!-for well may we utter these tragic exclamations at 
such a pitch of audacity in the coining of names as he has displayed without a 
blush, in devising a nomenclature for his system of falsehood. For when he 
declares: There is a certain Proarche before all things, surpassing all thought, 
whom I call Monotes; and again, with this Monotes there co-exists a power which 
I also call Henotes,-it is most manifest that he confesses the things which have 
been said to be his own invention, and that he himself has given names to his 
scheme of things, which had never been previously suggested by any other. It is 
manifest also, that he himself is the one who has had sufficient audacity to 
coin these names; so that, unless <I>he</I> had appeared in the world, the truth 
would still have been destitute of a name. But, in that case, nothing hinders 
any other, in dealing with the same subject, to affix names after such a fashion 
as the following: There 
is a certain Proarche, royal, surpassing all thought, a power existing before 
every other substance, and extended into space in every direction. But along 
with it there exists a power which I term a <I>Gourd; </I>and along with this 
Gourd there exists a power which again I term <I>Utter-Emptiness</I>. This Gourd 
and Emptiness, since they are one, produced (and yet did not simply produce, so 
as to be apart from themselves) a fruit, everywhere visible, eatable, and 
delicious, which fruit-language calls a <I>Cucumber</I>. Along with this 
Cucumber exists a power of the same essence, which again I call a <I>Melon</I>. 
These powers, the Gourd, Utter-Emptiness, the Cucumber, and the Melon, brought 
forth the remaining multitude of the delirious melons of Valentinus.
For if it is fitting that that language which is used respecting the universe be 
transformed to the primary Tetrad, and if any one may assign names at his 
pleasure, who shall prevent us from adopting these names, as being much more 
credible [than the others], as well as in general use, and understood by 
all?</P>
<P>5. Others still, however, have called their primary and first-begotten Ogdoad 
by the following names: first, Proarche; then Anennoetos; thirdly, Arrhetos; and 
fourthly, Aoratos. Then, from the first, Proarche, there was produced, in the 
first and fifth place, Arche; from Anennoetos, in the second and sixth place, 
Acataleptos; from Arrhetos, in the third and seventh place, Anonomastos; and 
from Aoratos, in the fourth and eighth place, Agennetos. This is the Pleroma of 
the first Ogdoad. They maintain that these powers were anterior to Bythus and 
Sige, that they may appear more perfect than the perfect, and more knowing than 
the very Gnostics To. these persons one may justly exclaim: "O ye trifling 
sophists!" since, even respecting Bythus himself, there are among them many and 
discordant opinions. For some/declare him to be without a consort, and neither 
male nor female, and, in fact, nothing at all; while others affirm him to be 
masculo-feminine, assigning to him the nature of a hermaphrodite; others, again, 
allot Sige to him as a spouse, that thus may be formed the first 
conjunction.</P>

  Followers of Ptolemy and Colorbasus.</FONT></P></UL>
<P>1. But the followers of Ptolemy say
that he [Bythos] has two consorts, which they also name <I>Diatheses 
</I>(affections), viz., Ennoae and Thelesis. For, as they affirm, he first 
conceived the thought of producing something, and then willed to that effect. 
Wherefore, again, these two affections, or powers, Ennoea and Thelesis, having 
intercourse, as it were, between themselves, the production of Monogenes and 
Aletheia took place according to conjunction. These two came forth as types and 
images of the two affections of the Father,-visible representations of those 
that were invisible,-Nous (i.e., Monogenes) of Thelesis, and Aletheia of Ennoea, 
and accordingly the image resulting from Thelesis was masculine,
while that from Ennoea was feminine. Thus Thelesis (will) became, as it were, a 
faculty of <FONT face="Semitica Dict">Enn&amp;oelig;a</FONT> (thought). For 
Ennoea continually yearned after offspring; but she could not of herself bring 
forth that which she desired. But when the power of Thelesis (the faculty of 
will) came upon her, then she brought forth that on which she had brooded.</P>
<P>2. These fancied beings
(like the Jove of Homer, who is represented
as passing an anxious sleepless night in devising plans for honouring Achilles 
and destroying numbers of the Greeks) will not appear to you, my dear friend, to 
be possessed of greater knowledge than He who is the God of the universe. He, as 
soon as He thinks, also performs what He has willed; and as soon as He wills, 
also thinks that which He has willed; then thinking when He wills, and then 
willing when He thinks, since He is all thought, [all will, all mind, all light, 
]
all eye, all ear, the one entire fountain of all good things.</P>
<P>3. Those of them, however, who are deemed more skilful than the persons who 
have just been mentioned, say that the first Ogdoad was not produced gradually, 
so that one Aeon was sent forth by another, but that all
the Aeons were brought into existence at once by Propator and his Ennoea. He 
(Colorbasus) affirms this as confidently as if he had assisted at their 
birth.Accordingly, he and his followers maintain that Anthropos and Ecclesia 
were not produced,
as others hold, from Logos and Zoe; but, on the contrary, Logos and Zoe from 
Anthropos and Ecclesia. But they express this in another form, as follows: When 
the Propator conceived the thought of producing something, he received the name 
of <I>Father</I>. But because what he did produce was <I>true</I>, it was named 
Aletheia. Again, when he wished to reveal himself, this was termed Anthropos. 
Finally, when he produced those whom he had previously thought of, these were 
named Ecclesia. Anthropos, by speaking, formed Logos: this is the first-born 
son. But Zoe followed upon Logos; and thus the first Ogdoad was completed.</P>
<P>4. They have much contention also among themselves respecting the Saviour. 
For some maintain that he was formed out of all; wherefore also he was called 
Eudocetos, because the whole Pleroma was <I>well pleased</I> through him to 
glorify the Father. But others assert that he was produced from those ten Aeons 
alone who sprung from Logos and Zoe, and that on this account he was called 
Logos and Zoe, thus preserving the ancestral names.
Others, again, affirm that he had his being from those twelve Aeons who were the 
offspring of Anthropos and Ecclesia; and on this account he acknowledges himself 
the Son of man, as being a descendant of Anthropos. Others still, assert that he 
was produced by Christ and the Holy Spirit, who were brought forth for the 
security of the Pleroma; and that on this account he was called Christ, thus 
preserving the appellation of the Father, by whom he was produced. And there are 
yet others among them who declare that the Propator of the whole, Proarche, and 
Proanennoetos is called Anthropos; and that this is the great and abstruse 
mystery, namely, that the Power which is above all others, and contains all in 
his embrace, is termed Anthropos; hence does the Saviour style himself the "Son 
of man."</P>

  <P><A name=P6413_1490521></A><FONT size=3>Chapter XIII.-The Deceitful Arts and 
  Nefarious Practices of Marcus.</FONT></P></UL>
<P>I. But 
there is another among these heretics, Marcus by name, who boasts himself as 
having improved upon his master. He is a perfect adept in magical impostures, 
and by this means drawing away a great number of men, and not a few women, he 
has induced them to join themselves to him, as to one who is possessed of the 
greatest knowledge and perfection, and who has received the highest power from 
the invisible and ineffable regions above. Thus it appears as if he really were 
the precursor of Antichrist. For, joining the buffooneries of Anaxilaus
to the craftiness of the <I>magi</I>, as they are called, he is regarded by his 
senseless and cracked-brain followers as working miracles by these means.</P>
<P>2. Pretending
to consecrate cups mixed with wine, and protracting to great length the word of 
invocation, he contrives to give them a purple and reddish colour, so that 
Charis,
who is one of those that are superior to all things, should be thought to drop 
her own blood into that cup through means of his invocation, and that thus those 
who are present should be led to rejoice to taste of that cup, in order that, by 
so doing, the Charis, who is set forth by this magician, may also flow into 
them. Again, handing mixed cups to the women, he bids them consecrate these in 
his presence. When this has been done, he himself produces another cup of much 
larger size than that which the deluded woman has consecrated, ) and pouting 
from the smaller one consecrated by the woman into that which has been brought 
forward by himself, he at the same time pronounces these words: "May that Chaffs 
who is before all things, and who transcends all knowledge and speech, fill 
thine inner man, and multiply in thee her own knowledge, by sowing the grain of 
mustard seed in thee as in good soil." Repeating certain other like words, and 
thus goading on the wretched woman [to madness], he then appears a worker of 
wonders when the large cup is seen to have been filled out of the small one, so 
as even to overflow by what has been obtained from it. By accomplishing several 
other similar things, he has completely deceived many, and drawn them away after 
him.</P>
<P>3. It appears probable enough that this man possesses a demon as his familiar 
spirit, by means of whom he seems able to prophesy,
and also enables as many as he counts worthy to be partakers of his Charis 
themselves to prophesy. He devotes himself especially to women, and those such 
as are well-bred, and elegantly attired, and of great wealth, whom he frequently 
seeks to draw after him, by addressing them in such seductive words as these: "I 
am eager to make thee a partaker of my Charis, since the Father of all doth 
continually behold thy angel before His face. Now the place of thy angel is 
among us:
it behoves us to become one. Receive first from me and by me [the gift of] 
Chaffs. Adorn thyself as a bride who is expecting her bridegroom, that thou 
mayest be what I am, and I what thou art. Establish the germ of light in thy 
nuptial chamber. Receive from me a spouse, and become receptive of him, while 
thou art received by him. Behold Charis has descended upon thee; open thy mouth 
and prophesy." On the woman replying," I have never at any time prophesied, nor 
do I know how to prophesy; "then engaging, for the second time, in certain 
invocations, so as to astound his deluded victim, he says to her," Open thy 
mouth, speak whatsoever occurs to thee, and thou shalt prophesy." She then, 
vainly puffed up and elated by these words, and greatly excited in soul by the 
expectation that it is herself who is to prophesy, her heart beating violently 
[from emotion], reaches the requisite pitch of audacity, and idly as well as 
impudently utters some nonsense as it happens. to occur to her, such as might be 
expected from one heated by an empty spirit. (Referring to this, one superior to 
me has observed, that the soul is both audacious and impudent when heated with 
empty air.) Henceforth she reckons herself a prophetess, and expresses her 
thanks to Marcus for having imparted to her of his own Chaffs. She then makes 
the effort to reward him, not only by the gift of her possessions (in which way 
he has collected a very large fortune), but also by yielding up to him her 
person, desiring in every way to be united to him, that she may become 
altogether one with him.</P>
<P>4. But already some of the most faithful women, possessed of the fear of God, 
and not being deceived (whom, nevertheless, he did his best to seduce like the 
rest by bidding them prophesy), abhorring and execrating him, have withdrawn 
from such a vile company of revellers. This they have done, as being well aware 
that the gift of prophecy is not conferred on men by Marcus, the magician, but 
that only those to whom God sends His grace from above possess the 
divinely-bestowed power of prophesying; and then they speak where and when God 
pleases, and not when Marcus orders them to do so. For that which commands is 
greater and of higher authority than that which is commanded, inasmuch as the 
former rules, while the latter is in a state of subjection. If, then, Marcus, or 
any one else, does command,-as these are accustomed continually at their feasts 
to play at drawing lots, and [in accordance with the lot] to command one another 
to prophesy, giving forth as oracles what is in harmony with their own 
desires,-it will follow that he who commands is greater and of higher authority 
than the prophetic spirit, though he is but a man, which is impossible. But such 
spirits as are commanded by these men, and speak when they desire it, are 
earthly and weak, audacious and impudent, sent forth by Satan for the seduction 
and perdition of those who do not hold fast that well-compacted faith which they 
received at first through the Church.</P>
<P>5. Moreover, that this Marcus compounds philters and love-potions, in order 
to insult the persons of some of these women, if not of all, those of them who 
have returned to the Church of God-a thing which frequently occurs-have 
acknowledged, confessing, too, that they have been defiled by him, and that they 
were filled with a burning passion towards him. A sad example of this occurred 
in the case of a certain Asiatic, one of our deacons, who had received him 
(Marcus) into his house. His wife, a woman of remarkable beauty, fell a victim 
both in mind and body to this magician, and, for a long time, travelled about 
with him. At last, when, with no small difficulty, the brethren had converted 
her, she spent her whole time in the exercise of public confession,
weeping over and lamenting the defilement which she had received from this 
magician.</P>
<P>6. Some of his disciples, too, addicting themselves
to the same practices, have deceived many silly women, and defiled them. They 
proclaim themselves as being "perfect," so that no one can be compared to them 
with respect to the immensity of their knowledge, nor even were you to mention 
Paul or Peter, or any other of the apostles. They assert that they themselves 
know more than all others, and that they alone have imbibed the greatness of the 
knowledge of that power which is unspeakable. They also maintain that they have 
attained to a height above all power, and that therefore they are free in every 
respect to act as they please, having no one to fear in anything. For they 
affirm, that because of the "Redemption"
it has come to pass that they can neither be apprehended, nor even seen by the 
judge. But even if he should happen to lay hold upon them, then they might 
simply repeat these words, while standing in his presence along with the 
"Redemption: ""O thou, who sittest beside God,
and the mystical, eternal Sige, thou through whom the angels (mightiness), who 
continually behold the face of the Father, having thee as their guide and 
introducer, do derive their forms
from above, which she in the greatness of her daring inspiring with mind on 
account of the goodness of the Propator, produced us as their images, having her 
mind then intent upon the things above, as in a dream,-behold, the judge is at 
hand, and the crier orders me to make my defence. But do thou, as being 
acquainted with the affairs of both, present the cause of both of us to the 
judge, inasmuch as it is in reality but one cause."
Now, as soon as the Mother hears these words, she puts the Homeric
helmet of Pluto upon them, so that they may invisibly escape the judge. And then 
she immediately catches them up, conducts them into the bridal chamber, and 
hands them over to their consorts. </P>
<P>7. Such are the words and deeds by which, in our own district of the Rhone, 
they have deluded many women, who have their consciences seared as with a hot 
iron.
Some of them, indeed, make a public confession of their sins; but others of them 
are ashamed to do this, and in a tacit kind of way, despairing of [attaining to] 
the life of God, have, some of them, apostatized altogether; while others 
hesitate between the two courses, and incur that which is implied in the 
proverb, "neither without nor within; "possessing this as the fruit from the 
seed of the children of knowledge.</P>

  <P><A name=P6436_1501446></A><FONT size=3>Chapter XIV.-The Various Hypotheses 
  of Marcus and Others. Theories Respecting Letters and Syllables.</FONT></P></UL>
<P>1. This Marcus
then, declaring that he alone was the matrix and receptacle of the Sige of 
Colorbasus, inasmuch as he was only-begotten, has brought to the birth in some 
such way as follows that which was committed to him of the defective Enthymesis. 
He declares that the infinitely exalted Tetrad descended upon him from the 
invisible and indescribable places in the form of a woman (for the world could 
not have borne it coming in its male form), and expounded to him alone its own 
nature, and the origin of all things, which it had never before revealed to any 
one either of gods or men. This was done in the following terms: When first the 
unoriginated, inconceivable Father, who is without material substance,
and is neither male nor female, willed to bring forth that which is ineffable to 
Him, and to endow with form that which is invisible, He opened His mouth, and 
sent forth the Word similar to Himself, who, standing near, showed Him what He 
Himself was, inasmuch as He had been manifested in the form of that which was 
invisible. Moreover, the pronunciation of His name took place as follows:-He 
spoke the first word of it, which was the beginning
[of all the rest], and that utterance consisted of four letters. He added the 
second, and this also consisted of four letters. Next He uttered the third, and 
this again embraced ten letters. Finally, He pronounced the fourth, which was 
composed of twelve letters. Thus took place the enunciation of the whole name, 
consisting of thirty letters, and four distinct utterances. Each of these 
elements has its own peculiar letters, and character, and pronunciation, and 
forms, and images, and there is not one of them that perceives the shape of that 
[utterance] of which it is an element. Neither does any one know
itself, nor is it acquainted with the pronunciation of its neighbour, but each 
one imagines that by its own utterance it does in fact name the whole. For while 
every one of them is a part of the whole, it imagines its own sound to be the 
whole name, and does not leave off sounding until, by its own utterance, it has 
reached the last letter of each of the elements. This teacher declares that the 
restitution of all things will take place, when all these, mixing into one 
letter, shall utter one and the same sound. He imagines that the emblem of this 
utterance is found in <I>Amen</I>, which we pronounce in concert.
The diverse sounds (he adds) are those which give form to that Aeon who is 
without material substance and unbegotten, and these, again, are the forms which 
the Lord has called angels, who continually behold the face of the 
Father.
</P>
<P>2. Those names of the elements which may be told, and are common, he has 
called Aeons, and words, and roots, and seeds, and fulnesses, and fruits. He 
asserts that each of these, and all that is peculiar to every one of them, is to 
be understood as contained in the name Ecclesia. Of these elements, the last 
letter of the last one uttered its voice, and this sound
going forth generated its own elements after the image of the [other] elements, 
by which he affirms, that both the things here below were arranged into the 
order they occupy, and those that preceded them were called into existence. He 
also maintains that the letter itself, the sound of which followed that sound 
below, was received up again by the syllable to which it belonged, in order to 
the completion of the whole, but that the sound remained below as if cast 
outside. But the element itself from which the letter with its special 
pronunciation descended to that below, he affirms to consist of thirty letters, 
while each of these letters, again, contains other letters in itself, by means 
of which the name of the letter is expressed. And thus, again, others are named 
by other letters, and others still by others, so that the multitude of letters 
swells out into infinitude. You may more clearly understand what I mean by the 
following example:-The word <I>Delta</I> contains five letters, viz., D, E, L, 
T, A: these letters again, are written by other letters,
and others still by others. If, then, the entire composition of the word Delta 
[when thus analyzed] runs out into infinitude, letters continually generating 
other letters, and following one another in constant succession, how much raster 
than that [one] word is the [entire] ocean of letters! And if even one letter be 
thus infinite, just consider the immensity of the letters in the entire name; 
out of which the Sige of Marcus has taught us the Propator is composed. For 
which reason the Father, knowing the incomprehensibleness of His own nature, 
assigned to the elements which He also terms Aeons, [the power] of each one 
uttering its own enunciation, because no one of them was capable by itself of 
uttering the whole.</P>
<P>3.Moreover, the Tetrad, explaining these things to him more fully, said:-I 
wish to show thee Aletheia (Truth) herself; for I have brought her down from the 
dwellings above, that thou mayest see her without a veil, and understand her 
beauty-that thou mayest also hear her speaking, and admire her wisdom. Behold, 
then, her head on high, <I>Alpha</I> and <I>Omega; </I>her neck, <I>Beta</I> and 
<I>Psi; </I>her shoulders with her hands, <I>Gamma</I> and <I>Chi; </I>her 
breast, <I>Delta</I> and <I>Phi; </I>her diaphragm, <I>Epsilon</I> and 
<I>Upsilon; </I>her back, <I>Zeta</I> and <I>Tau; </I>her belly, <I>Eta</I> and 
<I>Sigma; </I>her thighs, <I>Theta</I> and <I>Rho; </I>her knees, <I>Iota</I> 
and <I>Pi; </I>her legs, <I>Kappa</I> and <I>Omicron; </I>her ankles, 
<I>Lambda</I> and <I>Xi; </I>her feet, <I>Mu</I> and <I>Nu.</I> Such is the body 
of Truth, according to this magician, such the figure of the element, such the 
character of the letter. And he calls this element Anthropos (Man), and says 
that is the fountain of all speech, and the beginning of all sound, and the 
expression of all that is unspeakable, and the mouth of the silent Sige. This 
indeed is the body of Truth. But do thou, elevating the thoughts of thy mind on 
high, listen from the mouth of Truth to the self-begotten Word, who is also the 
dispenser of the bounty of the Father.</P>
<P>4. When she (the Tetrad) had spoken these things, Aletheia looked at him, 
opened her mouth, and uttered a word. That word was a name, and the name was 
this one which we do know and speak of, viz., Christ Jesus. When she had uttered 
this name, she at once relapsed into silence. And as Marcus waited in the 
expectation that she would say something more, the Tetrad again came forward and 
said, "Thou hast reckoned as contemptible that word which thou hast heard from 
the mouth of Aletheia. This which thou knowest and seemest to possess, is not an 
ancient name. For thou possessest the sound of it merely, whilst thou art 
ignorant of its power. For Jesus (<FONT face=SPIonic>'Ihsou=j</FONT>) is a name 
arithmetically 
symbolical, consisting of six letters, and is known by all those that belong to 
the called. But that which is among the Aeons of the Pleroma consists of many 
parts, and is of another form and shape, and is known by those [angels] who are 
joined in affinity with Him, and whose figures (mightinesses) are always present 
with Him.</P>
<P>5. Know, then, that the four-and-twenty letters which you possess are 
symbolical emanations of the three powers that contain the entire number of the 
elements above. For you are to reckon thus-that the nine mute
letters are [the images] of Pater and Aletheia, because they are without voice, 
that is, of such a nature as cannot be uttered or pronounced. But the 
semi-vowels
represent Logos and Zoe, because they are, as it were, midway between the 
consonants and the vowels, partaking
of the nature of both. The vowels, again, are representative of Anthropos and 
Ecclesia, inasmuch as a voice proceeding from Anthropos gave being to them all; 
for the sound of the voice imparted to them form. Thus, then, Logos and Zoe 
possess eight [of these letters]; Anthropos and Ecclesia seven; and Pater and 
Aletheia nine. But since the number allotted to each was unequal, He who existed 
in the Father came down, having been specially sent by Him from whom He was 
separated, for the rectification of what had taken place, that the unity of the 
Pleromas, being endowed with equality, might develop in all that one power which 
flows from all. Thus that division which had only seven letters, received the 
power of eight,
and the three sets were rendered alike in point of number, all becoming Ogdoads; 
which three, when brought together, constitute the number four-and-twenty. The 
three elements, too (which he declares to exist in conjunction with three 
powers,
and thus form the six from which have flowed the twenty-four letters), being 
quadrupled by the word of the ineffable Tetrad, give rise to the same number 
with them; and these elements he maintains to belong to Him who cannot be named. 
These, again, were endowed by the three powers with a resemblance to Him who is 
invisible. And he says that those letters which we call double 
are the images of the images of these elements; and if these be added to the 
four-and-twenty letters, by the force of analogy they form the number 
thirty.</P>
<P>6. He asserts that the fruit of this arrangement and analogy has been 
manifested in the likeness of an image, namely, Him who, after six days, 
ascended into the mountain along with three others, and then became one of six (the 
sixth), in which character He descended and was contained in the Hebdomad, since He was 
the illustrious Ogdoad,
and contained in Himself the entire number of the elements, which the descent of 
the dove (who is Alpha and Omega) made clearly manifest, when He came to be 
baptized; for the number of the dove is eight hundred and one.
And for this reason did Moses declare that man was formed on the sixth day; and 
then, again, according to arrangement, it was on the sixth day, which is the 
preparation, that the last man appeared, for the regeneration of the first, Of 
this arrangement, both the beginning and the end were formed at that sixth hour, 
at which He was nailed to the tree. For that perfect being Nous, knowing that 
the number six had the power both of formation and regeneration, declared to the 
children of light, that regeneration which has been wrought out by Him who 
appeared as the <I>Episemon</I> in regard to that number. Whence also he 
declares it is that the double letters
contain the Episemon number; for this Episemon, when joined to the twenty-four 
elements, completed the name of thirty letters.</P>
<P>7. He employed as his instrument, as the Sige of Marcus declares, the power 
of seven letters,
in order that the fruit of the independent will [of Achamoth] might be revealed. 
"Consider this present <I>Episemon</I>," she says-"Him who was formed after the 
[original] <I>Episemon</I>, as being, as it were, divided or cut into two parts, 
and remaining outside; who, by His own power and wisdom, through means of that 
which had been produced by Himself, gave life to this world, consisting of seven 
powers, 
after the likeness of the power of the Hebdomad, and so formed it, that it is 
the soul of everything visible. And He indeed uses this work Himself as if it 
had been formed by His own free will; but the rest, as being images of what 
cannot be [fully] imitated, are subservient to the Enthymesis of the mother. And 
the first heaven indeed pronounces <I>Alpha</I>, the next to this 
<I>Epsilon</I>, the third <I>Eta, </I>the fourth, which is also in the midst of 
the seven, utters the sound of <I>Iota</I>, the fifth <I>Omicron</I>, the sixth 
<I>Upsilon</I>, the seventh, which is also the fourth from the middle, utters 
the elegant <I>Omega</I>,"-as the Sige of Marcus, talking a deal of nonsense, 
but uttering no word of truth, confidently asserts. "And these powers," she 
adds, "being all simultaneously clasped in each other's embrace, do sound out 
the glory of Him by whom they were produced; and the glory of that sound is 
transmitted upwards to the Propator." She asserts, moreover, that "the sound of 
this uttering of praise, having been wafted to the earth, has become the Framer 
and the Parent of those things which are on the earth."</P>
<P>8. He instances, in proof of this, the case of infants who have just been 
born, the cry of whom, as soon as they have issued from the womb, is in 
accordance with the sound of every one of these elements. As, then, he says, the 
seven powers glorify the Word, so also does the complaining soul of 
infants.
For this reason, too, David said: "Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings Thou 
hast perfected praise; " and again: "The heavens declare the glory of God."
Hence also it comes to pass, that when the soul is involved in difficulties and 
distresses, for its own relief it calls out, "Oh" (<FONT face=SPIonic>W</FONT>), 
in honour of the letter in question, 
so that its cognate soul above may recognise [its distress], and send down to it 
relief.</P>
<P>9. Thus it is, that in regard to the whole name,
which consists of thirty letters, and Bythus, who receives his increase from the 
letters of this [name], and, moreover, the body of Aletheia, which is composed 
of twelve members, each of which consists of two letters, and the voice which 
she uttered without having spoken at all, and in regard to the analysis of that 
name which cannot be expressed in words, and the soul of the world and of man, 
according as they possess that arrangement, which is after the image [of things 
above], he has uttered his nonsensical opinions. It remains that I relate how 
the Tetrad showed him from the names a power equal in number; so that nothing, 
my friend, which I have received as spoken by him, may remain unknown to thee; 
and thus thy request, often proposed to me, may be fulfilled. </P>

  <P><A name=P6474_1518167></A><FONT size=3>Chapter XV.-Sige Relates to Marcus 
  the Generation of the Twenty-Four Elements and of Jesus. Exposure of These 
  Absurdities.</FONT></P></UL>
<P>1. The all-wise Sige then announced the production of the four-and-twenty 
elements to him as follows:-Along with Monotes there coexisted Henotes, from 
which sprang two productions, as we have remarked above, Monas and Hen, which, 
added to the other two, make four, for twice two are Four. And again, two and 
four, when added together, exhibit the number six. And further, these six being 
quadrupled, give rise to the twenty-four forms. And the names of the first 
Tetrad, which are understood to be most holy, and not capable of being expressed 
in words, are known by the Son alone, while the father also knows what they are. 
The other names which are to be uttered with respect, and faith, and reverence, 
are, according to him, Arrhetos and Sige, Pater and Aletheia. Now the entire 
number of this Tetrad amounts to four-and-twenty letters; for the name Arrhetos 
contains in itself seven letters, Seige 
five, Pater five, and Aletheia seven. If all these be added together-twice five, 
and twice seven-they complete the number twenty-four. In like manner, also, the 
second Tetrad, Logos and Zoe, Anthropos and Ecclesia, reveal the same number of 
elements. Moreover, that name of the Saviour which may be pronounced, viz., 
Jesus [<FONT face=SPIonic>'Ihsou=j</FONT>, consists of six letters, but His 
unutterable name comprises for-and-twenty letters. The name <I>Christ the 
Son</I>
(<FONT face=SPIonic>ui9o\ j Xreisto/j</FONT>) comprises twelve letter, but that 
which is unpronounceable in Christ contains thirty letters. And for this reason 
he declares that fie is <I>Alpha</I> and <I>Omega</I>, that he may indicate the 
dove, inasmuch as that bird has this number [in its name].</P>
<P>2. But Jesus, he affirms, has the following unspeakable origin. From the 
mother of all things, that is, the first Tetrad; there came forth the second 
Tetrad, after the manner of a daughter; and thus an Ogdoad was formed, from 
which, again, a Decad proceeded: thus was produced a Decad and an Ogdoad. The 
Decad, then, being joined with the Ogdoad, and multiplying it ten times, gave 
rise to the number <I>eighty</I>; and, again, multiplying eighty ten times, 
produced the number <I>eight hundred</I>. Thus, then, the whole number of the 
letters proceeding from the Ogdoad [multiplied] into the Decad, is eight hundred 
and eighty-eight.
This is the name of Jesus; for this name, if you reckon up the numerical value 
of the letters, amounts to eight hundred and eighty-eight. Thus, then, you have 
a clear statement of their opinion as to the origin of the supercelestial Jesus. 
Wherefore, also, the alphabet of the Greeks contains eight Monads, eight Decads, 
and eight Hecatads, which present the number eight hundred and eighty-eight, that is, 
<I>Jesus</I>, who is formed of all numbers; and on this account He is called 
<I>Alpha</I> and <I>Omega</I>, indicating His origin from all. And, again, they 
put the matter thus: If the first Tetrad be added up according to the 
progression of number, the number ten appears. For one, and two, and three, and 
four, when added together, form ten; and this, as they will have it, is Jesus. 
Moreover, Chreistus, he says, being a word of eight letters, indicates the first 
Ogdoad, and this, when multiplied by ten, gives birth to Jesus (888). And Christ 
the Son, he says, is also spoken of, that is, the Duodecad. For the name Son, 
(<FONT face=SPIonic>ui9o\ j</FONT>) contains four letters, and Christ 
(Chreistus) eight, which, being combined, point out the greatness of the 
Duodecad. But, he alleges, before the <I>Episemon</I> of this name appeared, 
that is Jesus the Son, mankind were involved in great ignorance and error. But 
when this name of six letters was manifested (the person bearing it clothing 
Himself in flesh, that He might come under the apprehension of man's senses, and 
having in Himself these six and twenty-four letters), then, becoming acquainted 
with Him, they ceased from their ignorance, and passed from death unto life, 
this name serving as their guide to the Father of truth.
For the Father of all had resolved to put an end to ignorance, and to destroy 
death. But this abolishing of ignorance was just the knowledge of Him. And 
therefore that man (Anthropos) was chosen according to His will, having been 
formed after the image of the [corresponding] power above.</P>
<P>3. As to the Aeons, they proceeded from the Tetrad, and in that Tetrad were 
Anthropos and Ecclesia, Logos and Zoe. The powers, then, he declares, who 
emanated from these, generated that Jesus who appeared upon the earth. The angel 
Gabriel took the place of Logos, the Holy Spirit that of Zoe, the Power of the 
Highest that of Anthropos, while the Virgin pointed out the place of Ecclesia. 
And thus, by a special dispensation, there was generated by Him, through Mary, 
that man, whom, as He passed through the womb, the Father of all chose to 
[obtain] the knowledge of Himself by means of the Word. And on His coming to the 
water [of baptism], there descended on Him, in the form of a dove, that Being 
who had formerly ascended on high, and completed the twelfth number, in whom 
there existed the seed of those who were produced contemporaneously with 
Himself, and who descended and ascended along with Him. Moreover, he maintains 
that power which descended was the seed of the Father, which had in itself both 
the Father and the Son, as well as that power of Sige which is known by means of 
them, but cannot be expressed in language, and also all the Aeons. And this was 
that Spirit who spoke by the mouth of Jesus, and who confessed that He was the 
son of Man as well as revealed the Father, and who, having descended into Jesus, 
was made one with Him. And he says that the Saviour formed by special 
dispensation did indeed destroy death, but that Christ made known the 
Father.
He maintains, therefore, that Jesus is the name of that man formed by a special 
dispensation, and that He was formed after the likeness and form of that 
[heavenly] Anthropos, who was about to descend upon Him. After He had received 
that Aeon, He possessed Anthropos himself, and Loges himself, and Pater, and 
Arrhetus, and Sige, and Aletheia, and Ecclesia, and Zoe.</P>
<P>4.Such ravings, we may now well say, go beyond <I>Iu, Iu, Pheu, Pheu, </I>and 
every kind of tragic exclamation or utterance of misery.
For who would not detest one who is the wretched contriver of such audacious 
falsehoods, when he perceives the truth turned by Marcus into a mere image, and 
that punctured all over with the letters of the alphabet? The Greeks confess 
that they first received sixteen letters from Cadmus, and that but recently, as 
compared with the beginning, [the vast antiquity of which is implied] in the 
common proverb: "Yesterday and before; "
and afterwards, in the course of time, they themselves invented at one period 
the aspirates, and at another the double letters, while, last of all, they say 
Palamedes added the long letters to the former. Was it so, then, that until 
these things took place among the Greeks, truth had no existence? For, according 
to thee, Marcus, the body of truth is posterior to Cadmus and those who preceded 
him-posterior also to those who added the rest of the letters-posterior even to 
thyself! For thou alone hast formed that which is called by thee the truth into 
an [outward, visible] image.</P>
<P>5. But who will tolerate thy nonsensical Sige, who names Him that cannot be 
named, and expounds the nature of Him that is unspeakable, and searches out Him 
that is unsearchable, and declares that He whom thou maintainest to be destitute 
of body and form, opened His mouth and sent forth the Word, as if He were 
included among organized beings; and that His Word, while like to His Author, 
and bearing the image of the invisible, nevertheless consisted of thirty 
elements and four syllables? It will follow, then, according to thy theory, that 
the Father of all, in accordance with the likeness of the Word, consists of 
thirty elements and four syllables! Or, again, who will tolerate thee in thy 
juggling with forms and numbers,-at one time thirty, at another twenty-four, and 
at another, again, only six,-whilst thou shuttest up [in these] the Word of God, 
the Founder, and Framer, and Maker of all things; and then, again, cutting Him 
up piecemeal into four syllables and thirty elements; and bringing down the Lord 
of all who founded the heavens to the number eight hundred and eighty-eight, so 
that He should be similar to the alphabet; and subdividing the Father, who 
cannot be contained, but contains all things, into a Tetrad, and an Ogdoad, and 
a Decad, and a Duodecad; and by such multiplications, setting forth the 
unspeakable and inconceivable nature of the Father, as thou thyself declarest it 
to be? And showing thyself a very Daedalus for evil invention, and the wicked 
architect of the supreme power, thou dost construct a nature and substance for 
Him whom thou callest incorporeal and immaterial, out of a multitude of letters, 
generated the one by the other. And that power whom thou affirmest to be 
indivisible, thou dost nevertheless divide into consonants, and vowels, and 
semi-vowels; and, falsely ascribing those letters which are mute to the Father 
of all things, and to His <FONT face="Semitica Dict">Enn&amp;oelig;a</FONT> 
(thought), thou hast driven on all that place confidence in thee to the highest 
point of blasphemy, and to the grossest impiety.
</P>
<P>6. With good reason, therefore, and very fittingly, in reference to thy rash 
attempt, has that divine elder
and preacher of the truth burst forth in verse against thee as follows:-"Marcus, 
thou former of idols, inspector of portents, Skill'd in consulting the stars, 
and deep in the black arts of magic, Ever by tricks such as these confirming the 
doctrines of error, Furnishing signs unto those involved by thee in deception, 
Wonders of power that is utterly severed from God and apostate, Which Satan, thy 
true father, enables thee still to accomplish, By means of Azazel, that fallen 
and yet mighty angel,-Thus making thee the precursor of his own impious 
actions."Such are the words of the saintly elder. And I shall endeavour to state 
the remainder of their mystical system, which runs out to great length, in brief 
compass, and to bring to the light what has for a long time been concealed. For 
in this way such things will become easily susceptible of exposure by all.</P>
<UL>
  <P><A name=P6492_1529410></A><FONT size=3>Chapter XVI.-Absurd Interpretations 
  of the Marcosians.</FONT></P></UL>
<P>1. Blending in one the production of their own Aeons, and the straying and 
recovery of the sheep [spoken of in the Gospel
], these persons endeavour to set forth things in a more mystical style, while 
they refer everything to numbers, maintaining that the universe has been formed 
out of a Monad and a Dyad. And then, reckoning from unity on to four, they thus 
generate the Decad. For when one, two, three, and four are added together, they 
give rise to the number of the ten Aeons. And, again, the Dyad advancing from 
itself [by twos] up to six-two, and four, and six-brings out the Duodecad. Once 
more, if we reckon in the same way up to ten, the number thirty appears, m which 
are found eight, and ten, and twelve. They therefore term the Duodecad-because 
it contains the Episemon,
and because the Episemon [so to speak] waits upon it-the passion. And for this 
reason, because an error occurred in connection with the twelfth number,
the sheep frisked off, and went astray; for they assert that a defection took 
place from the Duodecad. In the same way they oracularly declare, that one power 
having departed also from the Duodecad, has perished; and this was represented 
by the woman who lost the drachma, 
and, lighting a lamp, again found it. Thus, therefore, the numbers that were 
left, viz., nine, as respects the pieces of money, and eleven in regard to the 
sheep,
when multiplied together, give birth to the number ninety-nine, for nine times 
eleven are ninety-nine. Wherefore also they maintain the word "Amen" contains 
this number.</P>
<P>2. I will not, however, weary thee by recounting their other interpretations, 
that you may perceive the results everywhere. They maintain for instance, that 
the letter <I>Eta</I> (<FONT face=SPIonic>h</FONT>) along with the 
<I>Episemon</I> (<FONT face=SPIonic>\</FONT>) constitutes an Ogdoad, inasmuch 
as it occupies the eighth place from the first letter. Then, again, without the 
<I>Episemon</I>, reckoning the number of the letters, and adding them up till we 
come to <I>Eta</I>, they bring out the Priacontad. For if one begins at 
<I>Alpha</I> and ends with <I>Eta</I>, omitting the <I>Episeman</I>, and adds 
together the value of the letters in succession, he will find their number 
altogether to amount to thirty. For up to <I>Epsilon</I> (<FONT 
face=SPIonic>e</FONT>) fifteen are formed; then adding seven to that number, the 
sum of twenty-two is reached. Next, <I>Eta</I> being added to these, since its 
value is eight, the most wonderful Triacontad is completed. And hence they give 
forth that the Ogdoad is the mother of the thirty Aeons. Since, therefore, the 
number thirty is composed of three powers [the Ogdoad, Decad, and Duodecad], 
when multiplied by three, it produces ninety, for three times thirty are ninety. 
Likewise this Triad, when multiplied by itself, gives rise to nine. Thus the 
Ogdoad generates, by these means, ninety-nine. And since the twelfth Aeon, by 
her defection, left eleven in the heights above, they maintain that therefore 
the position of the letters is a true coordinate of the method of their 
calculation 
(for Lambda is the eleventh in order among the letters, and represents the 
number thirty), and also forms a representation of the arrangement of affairs 
above, since, on from Alpha, omitting <I>Episemon</I>, the number of the letters 
up to Lambda, when added together according to the successive value of the 
letters, and including <I>Lambda</I> itself, forms the sum of ninety-nine; but 
that this <I>Lambda</I>, being the eleventh in order, descended to seek after 
one equal to itself, so as to complete the number of twelve letters, and when it 
found such a one, the number was completed, is manifest from the very 
configuration of the letter; for <I>Lambda</I> being engaged, as it were, in the 
quest of one similar to itself, and finding such an one, and clasping it to 
itself, thus filled up the place of the twelfth, the letter <I>Mu</I> (<FONT 
face=SPIonic>M</FONT>) being composed of two <I>Lambdas</I> (<FONT 
face=SPIonic>LL</FONT>). Wherefore also they, by means of their "knowledge," 
avoid the place of ninety-nine, that is, the defection-a type of the left 
hand, 
-but endeavour to secure <I>one</I> more, which, when added to the ninety and 
nine, has the effect of changing their reckoning to the right hand.</P>
<P>3. I well know, my dear friend, that when thou hast read through all this, 
thou wilt indulge in a hearty laugh over this their inflated wise folly! But 
those men are really worthy of being mourned over, who promulgate such a kind of 
religion, and who so frigidly and perversely pull to pieces the greatness of the 
truly unspeakable power, and the dispensations of God in themselves so striking, 
by means of Alpha and Beta, and through the aid of numbers. But as many as 
separate from the Church, and give heed to such old wives' fables as these, are 
truly self-condemned; and these men Paul commands us, "after a first and second 
admonition, to avoid." 
And John, the disciple of the Lord, has intensified their condemnation, when he 
desires us not even to address to them the salutation of "good-speed; "for, says 
he, "He that bids them be of good-speed is a partaker with their evil deeds; "
and that with reason, "for there is no good-speed to the ungodly,"
saith the Lord. Impious indeed, beyond all impiety, are these men, who assert 
that the Maker of heaven and earth, the only God Almighty, besides whom there is 
no God, was produced by means of a defect, which itself sprang from another 
defect, so that, according to them, He was the product of the third 
defect.
Such an opinion we should detest and execrate, while we ought everywhere to flee 
far apart from those that hold it; and in proportion as they vehemently maintain 
and rejoice in their fictitious doctrines, so much the more should we be 
convinced that they are under the influence of the wicked spirits of the 
Ogdoad,-just as those persons who fall into a fit of frenzy, the more they 
laugh, and imagine themselves to be well, and do all things as if they were in 
good health [both of body and mind], yea, some things better than those who 
really are so, are only thus shown to be the more seriously diseased. In like 
manner do these men, the more they seem to excel others in wisdom, and waste 
their strength by drawing the bow too tightly,
the greater fools do they show themselves. For when the unclean spirit of folly 
has gone forth, and when afterwards he finds them not waiting upon God, but 
occupied with mere worldly questions, then, "taking seven other spirits more 
wicked than himself,"
and inflating the minds of these men with the notion of their being able to 
conceive of something beyond God, and having fitly prepared them for the 
reception of deceit, he implants within them the Ogdoad of the foolish spirits 
of wickedness.</P>

  <P><A name=P6510_1537184></A><FONT size=3>Chapter XVII.-The Theory of the 
  Marcosians, that Created Things Were Made After the Image of Things 
  Invisible.</FONT></P></UL>
<P>1. I wish also to explain to thee their theory as to the way in which the 
creation itself was formed through the mother by the Demiurge (as it were 
without his knowledge), after the image of things invisible. They maintain, 
then, that first of all the four elements, fire, water, earth, and air, were 
produced after the image of the primary Tetrad above, and that then, we add 
their operations, viz., heat, cold, dryness, and humidity, an exact likeness of 
the Ogdoad is presented. They next reckon up ten powers in the following 
manner:-There are seven globular bodies, which they also call heavens; then that 
globular body which contains these, which also they name the eighth heaven; and, 
in addition to these, the sun and moon. These, being ten in number, they declare 
to be types of the invisible Decad, which proceeded from Logos and Zoe. As to 
the Duodecad, it is indicated by the zodiacal circle, as it is called; for they 
affirm that the twelve signs do most manifestly shadow forth the Duodecad, the 
daughter of Anthropos and Ecclesia. And since the highest heaven, beating upon 
the very sphere [of the seventh heaven], has been linked with the most rapid 
precession of the whole system, as a check, and balancing that system with its 
own gravity, so that it completes the cycle from sign to sign in thirty 
years,-they say that this is an image of Horus, encircling their thirty-named 
mother. 
And then, again, as the moon travels through her allotted space of heaven in 
thirty days, they hold, that by these days she expresses the number of the 
thirty Aeons. The sun also, who runs through his orbit in twelve months, and 
then returns to the same point in the circle, makes the Duodecad manifest by 
these twelve months; and the days, as being measured by twelve hours, are a type 
of the invisible Duodecad. Moreover, they declare that the hour, which is the 
twelfth part of the day, is composed
of thirty parts, in order to set forth the image of the Triacontad. Also the 
circumference of the zodiacal circle itself contains three hundred and sixty 
degrees (for each of its signs comprises thirty); and thus also they affirm, 
that by means of this circle an image is preserved of that connection which 
exists between the twelve and the thirty. Still further, asserting that the 
earth is divided into twelve zones, and that in each zone it receives power from 
the heavens, according to the perpendicular [position of the sun above it], 
bringing forth productions corresponding to that power which sends down its 
influence upon it, they maintain that this is a most evident type of the 
Duodecad and its offspring.</P>
<P>2. In addition to these things, they declare that the Demiurge, desiring to 
imitate the infinitude, and eternity, and immensity, and freedom from all 
measurement by time of the Ogdoad above, but, as he was the fruit of defect, 
being unable to express its permanence and eternity, had recourse to the 
expedient of spreading out its eternity into times, and seasons, and vast 
numbers of years, imagining, that by the multitude of such times he might 
imitate its immensity . They declare further, that the truth having escaped him, 
he followed that which was false, and that, for this reason, when the times are 
fulfilled, his work shah perish.</P>

  <P><A name=P6516_1540734></A><FONT size=3>Chapter XVIII.-Passages from Moses, 
  Which the Heretics Pervert to the Support of Their Hypothesis.</FONT></P></UL>
<P>1. And while they affirm such things as these concerning the creation, every 
one of them generates something new, day by day, according to his ability; for 
no one is deemed "perfect," who does not develop among them some mighty 
fictions. It is thus necessary, first, to indicate what things they metamorphose 
[to their own use] out of the prophetical writings, and next, to refute them. 
Moses, then, they declare, by his mode of beginning the account of the creation, 
has at the commencement pointed out the mother of all things when he says, "In 
the beginning God created the heaven and the earth; "
for, as they maintain, by naming these four,-God, beginning, heaven, and 
earth,-he set forth their Tetrad. Indicating also its invisible and hidden 
nature, he said, "Now the earth was invisible and unformed."
They will have it, moreover, that he spoke of the second Tetrad, the offspring 
of the first, in this way-by naming an abyss and darkness, in which were also 
water, and the Spirit moving upon the water. Then, proceeding to mention the 
Decad, he names light, day, night, the firmament, the evening, the morning, dry 
land, sea, plants, and, in the tenth place, trees. Thus, by means of these ten 
names, he indicated the ten Aeons. The power of the Duodecad, again, was 
shadowed forth by him thus:-He names the sun, moon, stars, seasons, years, 
whales, fishes, reptiles, birds, quadrupeds, wild beasts, and after all these, 
in the twelfth place, man. Thus they teach that the Triacontad was spoken of 
through Moses by the Spirit. Moreover, man also, being formed after the image of 
the power above, had in himself that ability which flows from the one source. 
This ability was seated in the region of the brain, from which four faculties 
proceed, after the image of the Tetrad above, and these are called: the first, 
<I>sight</I>, the second, <I>hearing</I>, the third, <I>smell</I>, and the 
fourth, 
<I>taste</I>. And they say that the Ogdoad is indicated by man in this way: that 
he possesses two ears, the like number of eyes, also two nostrils, and a twofold 
taste, namely, of bitter and sweet. Moreover, they teach that the whole man 
contains the entire image of the Triacontad as follows: In his hands, by means 
of his fingers, he bears the Decad; and in his whole body the Duodecad, inasmuch 
as his body is divided into twelve members; for they portion that out, as the 
body of Truth is divided by them-a point of which we have already spoken. 
But the Ogdoad, as being unspeakable and invisible, is understood as hidden in 
the viscera.</P>
<P>2. Again, they assert that the sun, the great light-giver, was formed on the 
fourth day, with a reference to the number of the Tetrad. So also, according to 
them, the courts
of the tabernacle constructed by Moses, being composed of fine linen, and blue, 
and purple, and scarlet, pointed to the same image. Moreover, they maintain that 
the long robe of the priest failing over his feet, as being adorned with four 
rows of precious stones, 
indicates the Tetrad; and if there are any other things in the Scriptures which 
can possibly be dragged into the number <I>four</I>, they declare that these had 
their being with a view to the Tetrad. The Ogdoad, again, was shown as 
follows:-They affirm that man was formed on the eighth day, for sometimes they 
will have him to have been made on the sixth day, and sometimes on the eighth, 
unless, perchance, they mean that his earthly part was formed on the sixth day, 
but his fleshly part on the eighth, for these two things are distinguished by 
them. Some of them also hold that one man was formed after the image and 
likeness of God, masculo-feminine, and that this was the spiritual man; and that 
another man was formed out of the earth.</P>
<P>3. Further, they declare that the arrangement made with respect to the ark in 
the Deluge, by means of which eight persons were saved,
most clearly indicates the Ogdoad which brings salvation. David also shows forth 
the same, as holding the eighth place in point of age among his brethren.
Moreover, that circumcision which took place on the eighth day,
represented the circumcision of the Ogdoad above. In a word, whatever they find 
in the Scriptures capable of being referred to the number <I>eight</I>, they 
declare to fulfil the mystery of the Ogdoad. With respect, again, to the Decad, 
they maintain that it is indicated by those ten nations which God promised to 
Abraham for a possession.
The arrangement also made by Sarah when, after ten years, she gave
her handmaid Hagar to him, that by her he might have a son, showed the same 
thing. Moreover, the servant of Abraham who was sent to Rebekah, and presented 
her at the well with ten bracelets of gold, and her brethren who detained her 
for ten days;
Jeroboam also, who received the ten sceptres
(tribes), and the ten courts
of the tabernacle, and the columns of ten cubits
[high], and the ten sons of Jacob who were at first sent into Egypt to buy 
corn,
and the ten apostles to whom the Lord appeared after His 
resurrection,-Thomas
being absent,-represented, according to them, the invisible Decad.</P>
<P>4. As to the Duodecad, in connection with which the mystery of the passion of 
the defect occurred, from which passion they maintain that all things visible 
were framed, they assert that is to be found strikingly and manifestly 
everywhere [in Scripture]. For they declare that the twelve sons of 
Jacob,
from whom also sprung twelve tribes,-the breastplate of the high priest, which 
bore twelve precious stones and twelve little bells,
-the twelve stones which were placed by Moses at the foot of the 
mountain, 
-the same number which was placed by Joshua in the river,
and again, on the other side, the bearers of the ark of the covenant,
-those stones which were set up by Elijah when the heifer was offered as a 
burnt-offering;
the number, too, of the apostles; and, in fine, every event which embraces in it 
the number <I>twelve</I>,-set forth their Duodecad. And then the union of all 
these, which is called the Triacontad, they strenuously endeavour to demonstrate 
by the ark of Noah, the height of which was thirty cubits; 
by the case of Samuel, who assigned Saul the chief place among thirty 
guests;
by David, when for thirty days he concealed himself in the field;
by those who entered along with him into the cave; also by the fact that the 
length (height) of the holy tabernacle was thirty cubits;
and if they meet with any other like numbers, they still apply these to their 
Triacontad.</P>

  by Which They Attempt to Prove that the Supreme Father Was Unknown Before the 
  Coming of Christ.</FONT></P></UL>
<P>1. I judge it necessary to add to these details also what, by garbling 
passages of Scripture, they try to persuade us concerning their Propator, who 
was unknown to all before the coming of Christ. Their object in this is to show 
that our Lord announced another Father than the Maker of this universe, whom, as 
we said before, they impiously declare to have been the fruit of a defect. For 
instance, when the prophet Isaiah says, "But Israel hath not known Me, and My 
people have not understood Me,"
they pervert his words to mean ignorance of the invisible Bythus. And that which 
is spoken by Hosea, "There is no truth in them, nor the knowledge of 
God,"
they strive to give the same reference. And, "There is none that understandeth, 
or that seeketh after God: they have all gone out of the way, they are together 
become unprofitable,"
they maintain to be said concerning ignorance of Bythus. Also that which is 
spoken by Moses, "No man shall see God and live,"
has, as they would persuade us, the same reference.</P>
<P>2. For they falsely hold, that the Creator was seen by the prophets. But this 
passage, "No man shall see God and live," they would interpret as spoken of His 
greatness unseen and unknown by all; and indeed that these words, "No man shall 
see God," are spoken concerning the invisible Father, the Maker of the universe, 
is evident to us all; but that they are not used concerning that Bythus whom 
they conjure into existence, but concerning the Creator (and He is the invisible 
God), shall be shown as we proceed. They maintain that Daniel also set forth the 
same thing when he begged of the angels explanations of the parables, as being 
himself ignorant of them. But the angel, hiding from him the great mystery of 
Bythus, said unto him, "Go thy way quickly, Daniel, for these sayings are closed 
up until those who have understanding do understand them, and those who are 
white be made white."
Moreover, they vaunt themselves as being the <I>white</I> and the men of <I>good 
understanding</I>.</P>

  <P><A name=P6558_1550528></A><FONT size=3>Chapter XX.-The Apocryphal and 
  Spurious Scriptures of the Marcosians, with Passages of the Gospels Which They 
  Pervert.</FONT></P></UL>
<P>1. Besides the above [misrepresentations], they adduce an unspeakable number 
of apocryphal and spurious writings, which they themselves have forged, to 
bewilder the minds of foolish men, and of such as are ignorant of the Scriptures 
of truth. Among other things, they bring forward that false and wicked 
story
which relates that our Lord, when He was a boy learning His letters, on the 
teacher saying to Him, as is usual, "Pronounce Alpha," replied [as He was bid], 
"Alpha." But when, again, the teacher bade Him say, "Beta," the Lord replied, 
"Do thou first tell me what Alpha is, and then I will tell thee what Beta is." 
This they expound as meaning that He alone knew the Unknown, which He revealed 
under its type Alpha.</P>
<P>2. Some passages, also, which occur in the Gospels, receive from them a 
colouring of the same kind, such as the answer which He gave His mother when He 
was twelve years of age: "Wist ye not that I must be about My Father's business? "
Thus, they say, He announced to them the Father of whom they were ignorant. On 
this account, also, He sent forth the disciples to the twelve tribes, that they 
might proclaim to them the unknown God. And to the person who said to Him, "Good 
Master,"
He confessed that God who is truly good, saying, "Why callest thou Me good: 
there is One who is good, the Father in the heavens; "
and they assert that in this passage the Aeons receive the name of heavens. 
Moreover, by His not replying to those who said to Him, "By what power doest 
Thou this? "
but by a question on His own side, put them to utter confusion; by His thus not 
replying, according to their interpretation, He showed the unutterable nature of 
the Father. Moreover, when He said, "I have often desired to hear one of these 
words, and I had no one who could utter it,"
they maintain, that by this expression "one" He set forth the one true God whom 
they knew not. Further, when, as He drew nigh to Jerusalem, He wept over it and 
said, "If thou hadst known, even thou, in this thy day, the things that belong 
unto thy peace, but they are hidden from thee,"
by this word "hidden" He showed the abstruse nature of Bythus. And again, when 
He said, "Come unto Me all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give 
you rest, and learn of Me,"
He announced the Father of truth. For what they knew not, these men say that He 
promised to teach them.</P>
<P>3. But they adduce the following passage as the highest testimony, 
and, as it were, the very crown of their system:-"I thank Thee, O Father, Lord 
of heaven and earth, because Thou hast hid these things from the wise and 
prudent, and hast revealed them to babes. Even so, my Father; for so it seemed 
good in Thy sight. All things have been delivered to Me by My Father; and no one 
knoweth the Father but the Son, or the Son but the Father, and he to whom the 
Son will reveal Him."
In these words they affirm that He clearly showed that the Father of truth, 
conjured into existence by them, was known to no one before His advent. And they 
desire to construe the passage as if teaching that the Maker and Framer [of the 
world] was always known by all, while the Lord spoke these words concerning the 
Father unknown to all, whom they now proclaim.</P>
<UL>
  <P><A name=P6573_1554352></A><FONT size=3>Chapter XXI.-The Views of Redemption 
  Entertained by These Heretics.</FONT></P></UL>
<P>1. It happens that their tradition respecting redemption
is invisible and incomprehensible, as being the mother of things which are 
incomprehensible and invisible; and on this account, since it is fluctuating, it 
is impossible simply and all at once to make known its nature, for every one of 
them hands it down just as his own inclination prompts. Thus there are as many 
schemes of "<I>redemption</I>" as there are teachers of these mystical opinions. 
And when we come to refute them, we shall show in its fitting-place, that this 
class of men have been instigated by Satan to a denial of that baptism which is 
regeneration to God, and thus to a renunciation of the whole [Christian] 
faith.</P>
<P>2. They maintain that those who have attained to perfect knowledge must of 
necessity be regenerated into that power which is above all. For it is otherwise 
impossible to find admittance within the Pleroma, since this [regeneration] it 
is which leads them down into the depths of Bythus. For the baptism instituted 
by the visible Jesus was for the remission of sins, but the redemption brought 
in by that Christ who descended upon Him, was for perfection; and they allege 
that the former is animal, but the latter spiritual. And the baptism of John was 
proclaimed with a view to repentance, but the redemption by Jesus
was brought in for the sake of perfection. And to this He refers when He says, 
"And I have another baptism to be baptized with, and I hasten eagerly towards 
it."
Moreover, they affirm that the Lord added this redemption to the sons of 
Zebedee, when their mother asked that they might sit, the one on His right hand, 
and the other on His left, in His kingdom, saying, "Can ye be baptized with the 
baptism which I shall be baptized with? "
Paul, too, they declare, has often set forth, in express terms, the redemption 
which is in Christ Jesus; and this was the same which is handed down by them in 
so varied and discordant forms.</P>
<P>3. For some of them prepare a nuptial couch, and perform a sort of mystic 
rite (pronouncing certain expressions) with those who are being initiated, and 
affirm that it is a spiritual marriage which is celebrated by them, after the 
likeness of the conjunctions above. Others, again, lead them to a place where 
water is, and baptize them, with the utterance of these words, "Into the name of 
the unknown Father of the universe-into truth, the mother of all things-into Him 
who descended on Jesus-into union, and redemption, and communion with the 
powers." Others still repeat certain Hebrew words, in order the more thoroughly 
to bewilder those who are being initiated, as follows: "Basema, Chamosse, 
Baoenaora, Mistadia, Ruada, Kousta, Babaphor, Kalachthei."
The interpretation of these terms runs thus: "I invoke that which is above every 
power of the Father, which is called light, and good Spirit, and life, because 
Thou hast reigned in the body." Others, again, set forth the redemption thus: 
The name which is hidden from every deity, and dominion, and truth which Jesus 
of Nazareth was clothed with in the lives
of the light of Christ-of Christ, who lives by the Holy Ghost, for the angelic 
redemption. The name of restitution stands thus: Messia, Uphareg, Namempsoeman, 
Chaldoeaur, Mosomedoea, Acphranoe, Psaua, Jesus Nazaria.
The interpretation of these words is as follows: "I do not divide the Spirit of 
Christ, neither the heart nor the supercelestial power which is merciful; may I 
enjoy Thy name, O Saviour of truth!" Such are words of the initiators; but he 
who is initiated, replies, "I am established, and I am redeemed; I redeem my 
soul from this age (world), and from all things connected with it in the name of 
Iao, who redeemed his own soul into redemption in Christ who liveth." Then the 
bystanders add these words, "Peace be to all on whom this name rests." After 
this they anoint the initiated person with balsam; for they assert that this 
unguent is a type of that sweet odour which is above all things.</P>
<P>4. But there are some of them who assert that it is superfluous to bring 
persons to the water, but mixing oil and water together, they place this mixture 
on the heads of those who are to be initiated, with the use of some such 
expressions as we have already mentioned. And this they maintain to be the 
redemption. They, too, are accustomed to anoint with balsam. Others, however, 
reject all these practices, and maintain that the mystery of the unspeakable and 
invisible power ought not to be performed by visible and corruptible creatures, 
nor should that of those [beings] who are inconceivable, and incorporeal, and 
beyond the reach of sense, [be performed] by such as are the objects of sense, 
and possessed of a body. These hold that the knowledge of the unspeakable 
Greatness is itself perfect redemption. For since both defect and passion flowed 
from ignorance, the whole substance of what was thus formed is destroyed by 
knowledge; and therefore knowledge is the redemption of the inner man. This, 
however, is not of a corporeal nature, for the body is corruptible; nor is it 
animal, since the animal soul is the fruit of a defect, and is, as it were, the 
abode of the spirit. The redemption must therefore be of a spiritual nature; for 
they affirm that the inner and spiritual man is redeemed by means of knowledge, 
and that they, having acquired the knowledge of all things, stand thenceforth in 
need of nothing else. This, then, is the true redemption.</P>
<P>5. Others still there are who continue to redeem persons even up to the 
moment of death, by placing on their heads oil and water, or the pre-mentioned 
ointment with water, using at the same time the above-named invocations, that 
the persons referred to may become incapable of being seized or seen by the 
principalities and powers, and that their inner man may ascend on high in an 
invisible manner, as if their body were left among created things in this world, 
while their soul is sent forward to the Demiurge. And they instruct them, on 
their reaching the principalities and powers, to make use of these words: "I am 
a son from the Father-the Father who had a pre-existence, and a son in Him who 
is pre-existent. I have come to behold all things, both those which belong to 
myself and others, although, strictly speaking, they do not belong to others, 
but to Achamoth, who is female in nature, and made these things for herself. For 
I derive being from Him who is pre-existent, and I come again to my own place 
whence I went forth." And they affirm that, by saying these things, he escapes 
from the powers. He then advances to the companions of the Demiurge, and thus 
addresses them:-"I am a vessel more precious than the female who formed you. If 
your mother is ignorant of her own descent, I know myself, and am aware whence I 
am, and I call upon the incorruptible Sophia, who is in the Father, and is the 
mother of your mother, who has no father, nor any male consort; but a female 
springing from a female formed you, while ignorant of her own mother, and 
imagining that she alone existed; but I call upon her mother." And they declare, 
that when the companions of the Demiurge hear these words, they are greatly 
agitated, and upbraid their origin and the race of their mother. But he goes 
into his own place, having thrown [off] his chain, that is, his animal nature. 
These, then, are the particulars which have reached us respecting 
"redemption."
But since they differ so widely among themselves both as respects doctrine and 
tradition, and since those of them who are recognised as being most modern make 
it their effort daily to invent some new opinion, and to bring out what no one 
ever before thought of, it is a difficult matter to describe all their 
opinions.</P>
<UL>
  <P><A name=P6588_1562797></A><FONT size=3>Chapter XXII.-Deviations of Heretics 
  from the Truth.</FONT></P></UL>
<P>1. The rule
of truth which we hold, is, that there is one God Almighty, who made all things 
by His Word, and fashioned and formed, out of that which had no existence, all 
things which exist. Thus saith the Scripture, to that effect "By the Word of the 
Lord were the heavens established, and all the might of them, by the spirit of 
His mouth."
And again, "All things were made by Him, and without Him was nothing 
made."
There is no exception or deduction stated; but the Father made all things by 
Him, whether visible or invisible, objects of sense or of intelligence, 
temporal, on account of a certain character given them, or eternal; and these 
eternal things He did not make by angels, or by any powers separated from His Ennoea. 
For God needs none of all these things, but is He who, by His Word and Spirit, 
makes, and disposes, and governs all things, and commands all things into 
existence,-He who formed the world (for the world is of all),-He who fashioned 
man,-He [who]
is the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, above whom 
there is no other God, nor initial principle, nor power, nor pleroma,-He is the 
Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, as we shall prove. Holding, therefore, this 
rule, we shall easily show, notwithstanding the great variety and multitude of 
their opinions, that these men have deviated from the truth; for almost all the 
different sects of heretics admit that there is one God; but then, by their 
pernicious doctrines, they change [this truth into error], even as the Gentiles 
do through idolatry,-thus proving themselves ungrateful to Him that created 
them. Moreover, they despise the workmanship of God, speaking against their own 
salvation, becoming their own bitterest accusers, and being false witnesses 
[against themselves]. Yet, reluctant as they may be, these men shall one day 
rise again in the flesh, to confess the power of Him who raises them from the 
dead; but they shall not be numbered among the righteous on account of their 
unbelief.</P>
<P>2. Since, therefore, it is a complex and multiform task to detect and convict 
all the heretics, and since our design is to reply to them all according to 
their special characters, we have judged it necessary, first of all, to give an 
account of their source and root, in order that, by getting a knowledge of their 
most exalted Bythus, thou mayest understand the nature of the tree which has 
produced such fruits.</P>
<UL>
  <P><A name=P6597_1565674></A><FONT size=3>Chapter XXIII.-Doctrines and 
  Practices of Simon Magus and Menander.</FONT></P></UL>
<P>1. Simon the Samaritan was that magician of whom Luke, the disciple and 
follower of the apostles, says, "But there was a certain man, Simon by name, who 
beforetime used magical arts in that city, and led astray the people of Samaria, 
declaring that he himself was some great one, to whom they all gave heed, from 
the least to the greatest, saying, This is the power of God, which is called 
great. And to him they had regard, because that of long time he had driven them 
mad by his sorceries."
This Simon, then-who feigned faith, supposing that the apostles themselves 
performed their cures by the art of magic, and not by the power of God; and with 
respect to their filling with the Holy Ghost, through the imposition of hands, 
those that believed in God through Him who was preached by them, namely, Christ 
Jesus-suspecting that even this was done through a kind of greater knowledge of 
magic, and offering money to the apostles, thought he, too, might receive this 
power of bestowing the Holy Spirit on whomsoever he would,-was addressed in 
these words by Peter: "Thy money perish with thee, because thou hast thought 
that the gift of God can be purchased with money: thou hast neither part nor lot 
in this matter, for thy heart is not fight in the sight of God; for I perceive 
that thou art in the gall of bitterness, and in the bond of iniquity."
He, then, not putting faith in God a whit the more, set himself eagerly to 
contend against the apostles, in order that he himself might seem to be a 
wonderful being, and applied himself with still greater zeal to the study of the 
whole magic art, that he might the better bewilder and overpower multitudes of 
men. Such was his procedure in the reign of Claudius Caesar, by whom also he is 
said to have been honoured with a statue, on account of his magical 
power.
This man, then, was glorified by many as if he were a god; and he taught that it 
was himself who appeared among the Jews as the Son, but descended in Samaria as 
the Father while he came to other nations in the character of the Holy Spirit. 
He represented himself, in a word, as being the loftiest of all powers, that is, 
the Being who is the Father over all, and he allowed himself to be called by 
whatsoever title men were pleased to address him.</P>
<P>2. Now this Simon of Samaria, from whom all sorts of heresies derive their 
origin, formed his sect out of the following materials:-Having redeemed from 
slavery at Tyre, a city of Phoenicia, a certain woman named Helena, he was in 
the habit of carrying her about with him, declaring that this woman was the 
first conception of his mind, the mother of all, by whom, in the beginning, he 
conceived in his mind [the thought] of forming angels and archangels. For this 
Ennoea leaping forth from him, and comprehending the will of her father, 
descended to the lower regions [of space], and generated angels and powers, by 
whom also he declared this word was formed. But after she had produced them, she 
was detained by them through motives of jealousy, because they were unwilling to 
be looked upon as the progeny of any other being. As to himself, they had no 
knowledge of him whatever; but his Ennoea was detained by those powers and 
angels who had been produced by her. She suffered all kinds of contumely from 
them, so that she could not return upwards to her father, but was even shut up 
in a human body, and for ages passed in succession from one female body to 
another, as from vessel to vessel. She was, for example, in that Helen on whose 
account the Trojan war was undertaken; for whose sake also Stesichorus
was struck blind, because he had cursed her in his verses, but afterwards, 
repenting and writing what are called <I>palinodes</I>, in which he sang her 
praise, he was restored to sight. Thus she, passing from body to body, and 
suffering insults in every one of them, at last became a common prostitute; and 
she it was that was meant by the lost sheep.
</P>
<P>3. For this purpose, then, he had come that he might win her first, and free 
her from slavery, while he conferred salvation upon men, by making himself known 
to them. For since the angels ruled the world ill because each one of them 
coveted the principal power for himself, he had come to amend matters, and had 
descended, transfigured and assimilated to powers and principalities and angels, 
so that he might appear among men to be a man, while yet he was not a man; and 
that thus he was thought to have suffered in Judaea, when he had not suffered. 
Moreover, the prophets uttered their predictions under the inspiration of those 
angels who formed the world; for which reason those who place their trust in him 
and Helena no longer regarded them, but, as being free, live as they please; for 
men are saved through his grace, and not on account of their own righteous 
actions. For such deeds are not righteous in the nature of things, but by mere 
accident, just as those angels who made the world, have thought fit to 
constitute them, seeking, by means of such precepts, to bring men into bondage. 
On this account, he pledged himself that the world should be dissolved, and that 
those who are his should be freed from the rule of them who made the world.</P>
<P>4. Thus, then, the mystic priests belonging to this sect both lead profligate 
lives and practise magical arts, each one to the extent of his ability. They use 
exorcisms and incantations. Love-potions, too, and charms, as well as those 
beings who are called "Paredri" (familiars) and "Oniropompi" (dream-senders), 
and whatever other curious arts can be had recourse to, are eagerly pressed into 
their service. They also have an image of Simon fashioned after the likeness of 
Jupiter, and another of Helena in the shape of Minerva; and these they worship. 
In fine, they have a name derived from Simon, the author of these most impious 
doctrines, being called Simonians; and from them "knowledge, falsely so 
called,"
received its beginning, as one may learn even from their own assertions.</P>
<P>5. The successor of this man was Menander, also a Samaritan by birth, and he, 
too, was a perfect adept in the practice of magic. He affirms that the primary 
Power continues unknown to all, but that he himself is the person who has been 
sent forth from the presence of the invisible beings as a saviour, for the 
deliverance of men. The world was made by angels, whom, like Simon, he maintains 
to have been produced by Ennoea. He gives, too, as he affirms, by means of that 
magic which he teaches, knowledge to this effect, that one may overcome those 
very angels that made the world; for his disciples obtain the 
<I>resurrection</I> by being baptized into him, and can die no more, but remain 
in the possession of immortal youth.</P>
<UL>
  <P><A name=P6610_1572871></A><FONT size=3>Chapter XXIV.-Doctrines of 
  Saturninus and Basilides.</FONT></P></UL>
<P>1. Arising among these men, Saturninus (who was of that Antioch which is near 
Daphne) and Basilides laid hold of some favourable opportunities, and 
promulgated different systems of doctrine-the one in Syria, the other at 
Alexandria. Saturninus, like Menander, set forth one father unknown to all, who 
made angels, archangels, powers, and potentates. The world, again, and all 
things therein, were made by a certain company of seven angels. Man, too, was 
the workmanship of angels, a shining image bursting forth below from the 
presence of the supreme power; and when they could not, he says, keep hold of 
this, because it immediately darted upwards again, they exhorted each other, 
saying, "Let us make man after our image and likeness."
He was accordingly formed, yet was unable to stand erect, through the inability 
of the angels to convey to him that power, but wriggled [on the ground] like a 
worm. Then the power above taking pity upon him, since he was made after his 
likeness, sent forth a spark of life, which gave man an erect posture, compacted 
his joints, and made him live. He declares, therefore, that this spark of life, 
after the death of a man, returns to those things which are of the same nature 
with itself, and the rest of the body is decomposed into its original 
elements.</P>
<P>2. He has also laid it down as a truth, that the Saviour was without birth, 
without body, and without figure, but was, by supposition, a visible man; and he 
maintained that the God of the Jews was one of the angels; and, on this account, 
because all the powers wished to annihilate his father, Christ came to destroy 
the God of the Jews, but to save such as believe in him; that is, those who 
possess the spark of his life. This heretic was the first to affirm that two 
kinds of men were formed by the angels,-the one wicked, and the other good. And 
since the demons assist the most wicked, the Saviour came for the destruction of 
evil men and of the demons, but for the salvation of the good. They declare 
also, that marriage and generation are from Satan.
Many of those, too, who belong to his school, abstain from animal food, and draw 
away multitudes by a reigned temperance of this kind. They hold, moreover, that 
some of the prophecies were uttered by those angels who made the world, and some 
by Satan; whom Saturninus represents as being himself an angel, the enemy of the 
creators of the world, but especially of the God of the Jews.</P>
<P>3. Basilides again, that he may appear to have discovered something more 
sublime and plausible, gives an immense development to his doctrines. He sets 
forth that Nous was first born of the unborn father, that from him, again, was 
born Logos, from Logos Phronesis, from Phronesis Sophia and Dynamis, and from 
Dynamis and Sophia the powers, and principalities, and angels, whom he also 
calls the <I>first; </I>and that by them the first heaven was made. Then other 
powers, being formed by emanation from these, crated another heaven similar to 
the first; and in like manner, when others, again, had been formed by emanation 
from them, corresponding exactly to those above them, these, too, framed another 
third heaven; and then from this third, in downward order, there was a fourth 
succession of descendants; and so on, after the same fashion, they declare that 
more and more principalities and angels were formed, and three hundred and 
sixty-five heavens. 
Wherefore the year contains the same number of days in conformity with the 
number of the heavens.</P>
<P>4. Those angels who occupy the lowest heaven, that, namely, which is visible 
to us, formed all the things which are in the world, and made allotments among 
themselves of the earth and of those nations which are upon it. The chief of 
them is he who is thought to be the God of the Jews; and inasmuch as he desired 
to render the other nations subject to his own people, that is, the Jews, all 
the other princes resisted and opposed him. Wherefore all other nations were at 
enmity with his nation. But the father without birth and without name, 
perceiving that they would be destroyed, sent his own first-begotten Nous (he it 
is who is called Christ) to bestow deliverance on them that believe in him, from 
the power of those who made the world. He appeared, then, on earth as a man, to 
the nations of these powers, and wrought miracles. Wherefore he did not himself 
suffer death, but Simon, a certain man of Cyrene, being compelled, bore the 
cross in his stead; so that this latter being transfigured by him, that he might 
be thought to be Jesus, was crucified, through ignorance and error, while Jesus 
himself received the form of Simon, and, standing by, laughed at them. For since 
he was an incorporeal power, and the Nous (mind) of the unborn father, he 
transfigured himself as he pleased, and thus ascended to him who had sent him, 
deriding them, inasmuch as he could not be laid hold of, and was invisible to 
all. Those, then, who know these things have been freed from the principalities 
who formed the world; so that it is not incumbent on us to confess him who was 
crucified, but him who came in the form of a man, and was thought to be 
crucified, and was called Jesus, and was sent by the father, that by this 
dispensation he might destroy the works of the makers of the world. If any one, 
therefore, he declares, confesses the crucified, that man is still a slave, and 
under the power of those who formed our bodies; but he who denies him has been 
freed from these beings, and is acquainted with the dispensation of the unborn 
father. </P>
<P>5. Salvation belongs to the soul alone, for the body is by nature subject to 
corruption. He declares, too, that the prophecies were derived from those powers 
who were the makers of the world, but the law was specially given by their 
chief, who led the people out of the land of Egypt. He attaches no importance to 
[the question regarding] meats offered in sacrifice to idols, thinks them of no 
consequence, and makes use of them without any hesitation; he holds also the use 
of other things, and the practice of every kind of lust, a matter of perfect 
indifference. These men, moreover, practise magic; and use images, incantations, 
invocations, and every other kind of curious art. Coining also certain names as 
if they were those of the angels, they proclaim some of these as belonging to 
the first, and others to the second heaven; and then they strive to set forth 
the names, principles, angels, and powers of the three hundred and sixty-five 
imagined heavens. They also affirm that the barbarous name in which the Saviour 
ascended and descended, is Caulacau. 
</P>
<P>6. He, then, who has learned [these things], and known all the angels and 
their causes, is rendered invisible and incomprehensible to the angels and all 
the powers, even as Caulacau also was. And as the son was unknown to all, so 
must they also be known by no one; but while they know all, and pass through 
all, they themselves remain invisible and unknown to all; for, "Do thou," they 
say, "know all, but let nobody know thee." For this reason, persons of such a 
persuasion are also ready to recant [their opinions], yea, rather, it is 
impossible that they should suffer on account of a mere name, since they are 
like to all. The multitude, however, cannot understand these matters, but only 
one out of a thousand, or two out of ten thousand. They declare that they are no 
longer Jews, and that they are not yet Christians; and that it is not at all 
fitting to speak openly of their mysteries, but right to keep them secret by 
preserving silence.</P>
<P>7. They make out the local position of the three hundred and sixty-five 
heavens in the same way as do mathematicians. For, accepting the theorems of 
these latter, they have transferred them to their own type of doctrine. They 
hold that their chief is <I>Abraxas; </I>
and, on this account, that word contains in itself the numbers amounting to 
three hundred and sixty-five.</P>
<UL>
  <P><A name=P6624_1581594></A><FONT size=3>Chapter XXV.-Doctrines of 
  Carpocrates.</FONT></P></UL>
<P>1. Carpocrates, again, and his followers maintain that the world and the 
things which are therein were created by angels greatly inferior to the 
unbegotten Father. They also hold that Jesus was the son of Joseph, and was just 
like other men, with the exception that he differed from them in this respect, 
that inasmuch as his soul was stedfast and pure, he perfectly remembered those 
things which he had witnessed
within the sphere of the unbegotten God. On this account, a power descended upon 
him from the Father, that by means of it he might escape from the creators of 
the world; and they say that it, after passing through them all, and remaining 
in all points free, ascended again to him, and to the powers,
which in the same way embraced like things to itself. They further declare, that 
the soul of Jesus, although educated in the practices of the Jews, regarded 
these with contempt, and that for this reason he was endowed with faculties, by 
means of which he destroyed those passions which dwelt in men as a punishment 
[for their sins].</P>
<P>2. The soul, therefore, which is like that of Christ can despise those rulers 
who were the creators of the world, and, in like manner, receives power for 
accomplishing the same results. This idea has raised them to such a pitch of 
pride, that some of them declare themselves similar to Jesus; while others, 
still more mighty, maintain that they are superior to his disciples, such as 
Peter and Paul, and the rest of the apostles, whom they consider to be in no 
respect inferior to Jesus. For their souls, descending from the same sphere as 
his, and therefore despising in like manner the creators of the world, are 
deemed worthy of the same power, and again depart to the same place. But if any 
one shall have despised the things in this world more than he did, he thus 
proves himself superior to him.</P>
<P>3. They practise also magical arts and incantations; philters, also, and 
love-potions; and have recourse to familiar spirits, dream-sending demons, and 
other abominations, declaring that they possess power to rule over, even now, 
the princes and formers of this world; and not only them, but also all things 
that are in it. These men, even as the Gentiles, have been sent forth by Satan
to bring dishonour upon the Church, so that, in one way or another, men hearing 
the things which they speak, and imagining that we all are such as they, may 
turn away their ears from the preaching of the truth; or, again, seeing the 
things they practise, may speak evil of us all, who have in fact no fellowship 
with them, either in doctrine or in morals, or in our daily conduct. But they 
lead a licentious life,
and, to conceal their impious doctrines, they abuse the name [of Christ], as a 
means of hiding their wickedness; so that "their condemnation is just,"
when they receive from God a recompense suited to their works.</P>
<P>4. So unbridled is their madness, that they declare they have in their power 
all things which are irreligious and impious, and are at liberty to practise 
them; for they maintain that things are evil or good, simply in virtue of human 
opinion.
They deem it necessary, therefore, that by means of transmigration from body to 
body, souls should have experience of every kind of life as well as every kind 
of action (unless, indeed, by a single incarnation, one may be able to prevent 
any need for others, by once for all, and with equal completeness, doing all 
those things which we dare not either speak or hear of, nay, which we must not 
even conceive in our thoughts, nor think credible, if any such thing is mooted 
among those persons who are our fellow-citizens), in order that, as their 
writings express it, their souls, having made trial of every kind of life, may, 
at their departure, not be wanting in any particular. It is necessary
to insist upon this, lest, on account of some one thing being still wanting to 
their deliverance, they should be compelled once more to become incarnate. They 
affirm that for this reason Jesus spoke the following parable:-"Whilst thou art 
with thine adversary in the way, give all diligence, that thou mayest be 
delivered from him, lest he give thee up to the judge, and the judge surrender 
thee to the officer, and he cast thee into prison. Verily, I say unto thee, thou 
shalt not go out thence until thou pay the very last farthing."
They also declare the "adversary" is one of those angels who are in the world, 
whom they call the Devil, maintaining that he was formed for this purpose, that 
he might lead those souls which have perished from the world to the Supreme 
Ruler. They describe him also as being chief among the makers of the world, and 
maintain that he delivers such souls [as have been mentioned] to another angel, 
who ministers to him, that he may shut them up in other bodies; for they declare 
that the body is "the prison." Again, they interpret these expressions, "Thou 
shalt not go out thence until thou pay the very last farthing," as meaning that 
no one can escape from the power of those angels who made the world, but that he 
must pass from body to body, until he has experience of every kind of action 
which can be practised in this world, and when nothing is longer wanting to him, 
then his liberated soul should soar upwards to that God who is above the angels, 
the makers of the world. In this way also all souls are saved, whether their own 
which, guarding against all delay, participate in all sorts of actions during 
one incarnation, or those, again, who, by passing from body to body, are set 
free, on fulfilling and accomplishing what is requisite in every form of life 
into which they are sent, so that at length they shall no longer be [shut in the 
body.</P>
<P>5. And thus, if ungodly, unlawful, and forbidden actions are committed among 
them, I can no longer find ground for believing them to be such.
And in their writings we read as follows, the interpretation which they give [of 
their views], declaring that Jesus spoke in a mystery to His disciples and 
apostles privately, and that they requested and obtained permission to hand down 
the things thus taught them, to others who should be worthy and believing. We 
are saved, indeed, by means of faith and love; but all other things, while in 
their nature indifferent, are reckoned by the opinion of men-some good and some 
evil, there being nothing really evil by nature.</P>
<P>6. Others of them employ outward marks, branding their disciples inside the 
lobe of the right ear. From among these also arose Marcellina, who came to Rome 
under [the episcopate of] Anicetus, and, holding these doctrines, she led 
multitudes astray. They style themselves Gnostics. They also possess images, 
some of them painted, and others formed from different kinds of material; while 
they maintain that a likeness of Christ was made by Pilate at that time when 
Jesus lived among them.
They crown these images, and set them up along with the images of the 
philosophers of the world that is to say, with the images of Pythagoras, and 
Plato, and Aristotle, and the rest. They have also other modes of honouring 
these images, after the same manner of the Gentiles.</P>

  <P><A name=P6642_1589520></A><FONT size=3>Chapter XXVI.-Doctrines of 
  Cerinthus, the Ebionites, and Nicolaitanes.</FONT></P></UL>
<P>1. Cerinthus, again, a man who was educated
in the wisdom of the Egyptians, taught that the world was not made by the 
primary God, but by a certain Power far separated from him, and at a distance 
from that Principality who is supreme over the universe, and ignorant of him who 
is above all. He represented Jesus as having not been born of a virgin, but as 
being the son of Joseph and Mary according to the ordinary course of human 
generation, while he nevertheless was more righteous, prudent, and wise than 
other men. Moreover, after his baptism, Christ descended upon him in the form of 
a dove from the Supreme Ruler, and that then he proclaimed the unknown Father, 
and performed miracles. But at last Christ departed from Jesus, and that then 
Jesus suffered and rose again, while Christ remained impassible, inasmuch as he 
was a spiritual being.</P>
<P>2. Those who are called Ebionites agree that the world was made by God; but 
their opinions with respect to the Lord are similar to those of Cerinthus and 
Carpocrates. They use the Gospel according to Matthew only, and repudiate the 
Apostle Paul, maintaining that he was an apostate from the law. As to the 
prophetical writings, they endeavour to expound them in a somewhat singular 
manner: they practise circumcision, persevere in the observance of those customs 
which are enjoined by the law, and are so Judaic in their style of life, that 
they even adore Jerusalem as if it were the house of God.</P>
<P>3. The Nicolaitanes are the followers of that Nicolas who was one of the 
seven first ordained to the diaconate by the apostles.
They lead lives of unrestrained indulgence. The character of these men is very 
plainly pointed out in the Apocalypse of John, [when they are represented] as 
teaching that it is a matter of indifference to practise adultery, and to eat 
things sacrificed to idols. Wherefore the Word has also spoken of them thus: 
"But this thou hast, that thou hatest the deeds of the Nicolaitanes, which I 
also hate."

<UL>
  <P><A name=P6650_1591742></A><FONT size=3>Chapter XXVII.-Doctrines of Cerdo 
  and Marcion.</FONT></P></UL>
<P>1. Cerdo was one who took his system from the followers of Simon, and came to 
live at Rome in the time of Hyginus, who held the ninth place in the episcopal 
succession from the apostles downwards. He taught that the God proclaimed by the 
law and the prophets was not the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ. For the former 
was known, but the latter unknown; while the one also was righteous, but the 
other benevolent.</P>
<P>2. Marcion of Pontus succeeded him, and developed his doctrine. In so doing, 
he advanced the most daring blasphemy against Him who is proclaimed as God by 
the law and the prophets, declaring Him to be the author of evils, to take 
delight in war, to be infirm of purpose, and even to be contrary to Himself. But 
Jesus being derived from that father who is above the God that made the world, 
and coming into Judaea in the times of Pontius Pilate the governor, who was the 
procurator of Tiberius Caesar, was manifested in the form of a man to those who 
were in Judaea, abolishing the prophets and the law, and all the works of that 
God who made the world, whom also he calls Cosmocrator. Besides this, he 
mutilates the Gospel which is according to Luke, removing all that is written 
respecting the generation of the Lord, and setting aside a great deal of the 
teaching of the Lord, in which the Lord is recorded as most dearly confessing 
that the Maker of this universe is His Father. He likewise persuaded his 
disciples that he himself was more worthy of credit than are those apostles who 
have handed down the Gospel to us, furnishing them not with the Gospel, but 
merely a fragment of it. In like manner, too, he dismembered the Epistles of 
Paul, removing all that is said by the apostle respecting that God who made the 
world, to the effect that He is the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, and also 
those passages from the prophetical writings which the apostle quotes, in order 
to teach us that they announced beforehand the coming of the Lord.</P>
<P>3. Salvation will be the attainment only of those souls which had learned his 
doctrine; while the body, as having been taken from the earth, is incapable of 
sharing in salvation. In addition to his blasphemy against God Himself, he 
advanced this also, truly speaking as with the mouth of the devil, and saying 
all things in direct opposition to the truth,-that Cain, and those like him, and 
the Sodomites, and the Egyptians, and others like them, and, in fine, all the 
nations who walked in all sorts of abomination, were saved by the Lord, on His 
descending into Hades, and on their running unto Him, and that they welcomed Him 
into their kingdom. But the serpent
which was in Marcion declared that Abel, and Enoch, and Noah, and those other 
righteous men who sprang
from the patriarch Abraham, with all the prophets, and those who were pleasing 
to God, did not partake in salvation. For since these men, he says, knew that 
their God was constantly tempting them, so now they suspected that He was 
tempting them, and did not run to Jesus, or believe His announcement: and for 
this reason he declared that their souls remained in Hades.</P>
<P>4. But since this man is the only one who has dared openly to mutilate the 
Scriptures, and unblushingly above all others to inveigh against God, I purpose 
specially to refute him, convicting him out of his own writings; and, with the 
help of God, I shall overthrow him out of those
discourses of the Lord and the apostles, which are of authority with him, and of 
which he makes use. At present, however, I have simply been led to mention him, 
that thou mightest know that all those who in any way corrupt the truth, and 
injuriously affect the preaching of the Church, are the disciples and successors 
of Simon Magus of Samaria. Although they do not confess the name of their 
master, in order all the more to seduce others, yet they do teach his doctrines. 
They set forth, indeed, the name of Christ Jesus as a sort of lure, but in 
various ways they introduce the impieties of Simon; and thus they destroy 
multitudes, wickedly disseminating their own doctrines by the use of a good 
name, and, through means of its sweetness and beauty, extending to their hearers 
the bitter and malignant poison of the serpent, the great author of 
apostasy.

  <P><A name=P6660_1596236></A><FONT size=3>Chapter XXVIII.-Doctrines of Tatian, 
  the Encratites, and Others.</FONT></P></UL>
<P>1. Many offshoots of numerous heresies have already been formed from those 
heretics we have described. This arises from the fact that numbers of 
them-indeed, we may say all-desire themselves to be teachers, and to break off 
from the particular heresy in which they have been involved. Forming one set of 
doctrines out of a totally different system of opinions, and then again others 
from others, they insist upon teaching something new, declaring themselves the 
inventors of any sort of opinion which they may have been able to call into 
existence. To give an example: Springing from Saturninus and Marcion, those who 
are called Encratites (self-controlled) preached against marriage, thus setting 
aside the original creation of God, and indirectly blaming Him who made the male 
and female for the propagation of the human race. Some of those reckoned among 
them have also introduced abstinence from animal food, thus proving themselves 
ungrateful to God, who formed all things. They deny, too, the salvation of him 
who was first created. It is but lately, however, that this opinion has been 
invented among them. A certain man named Tatian first introduced the blasphemy. 
He was a hearer of Justin's, and as long as he continued with him he expressed 
no such views; but after his martyrdom he separated from the Church, and, 
excited and puffed up by the thought of being a teacher, as if he were superior 
to others, he composed his own peculiar type of doctrine. He invented a system 
of certain invisible Aeons, like the followers of Valentinus; while, like 
Marcion and Saturninus, he declared that marriage was nothing else than 
corruption and fornication.
But his denial of Adam's salvation was an opinion due entirely to himself.</P>
<P>2. Others, again, following upon Basilides and Carpocrates, have introduced 
promiscuous intercourse and a plurality of wives, and are indifferent about 
eating meats sacrificed to idols, maintaining that God does not greatly regard 
such matters. But why continue? For it is an impracticable attempt to mention 
all those who, in one way or another, have fallen away from the truth.</P>
<UL>
  <P><A name=P6665_1598542></A><FONT size=3>Chapter XXIX.-Doctrines of Various 
  Other Gnostic Sects, and Especially of the Barbeliotes or 
  Borborians.</FONT></P></UL>
<P>1. Besides those, however, among these heretics who are Simonians, and of 
whom we have already spoken, a multitude of Gnostics have sprung up, and have 
been manifested like mushrooms growing out of the ground. I now proceed to 
describe the principal opinions held by them. Some of them, then, set forth a 
certain Aeon who never grows old, and exists in a virgin spirit: him they style 
Barbelos. 
They declare that somewhere or other there exists a certain father who cannot be 
named, and that he was desirous to reveal himself to this Barbelos. Then this 
Ennoea went forward, stood before his face, and demanded from him Prognosis 
(prescience). But when Prognosis had, [as was requested, ] come forth, these two 
asked for Aphtharsia (incorruption), which also came forth, and after that Zoe 
Aionios (eternal life). Barbelos, glorying in these, and contemplating their 
greatness, and in conception
[thus formed], rejoicing in this greatness, generated light similar to it. They 
declare that this was the beginning both of light and of the generation of all 
things; and that the Father, beholding this light, anointed it with his own 
benignity, that it might be rendered perfect. Moreover, they maintain that this 
was Christ, who again, according to them, requested that Nous should be given 
him as an assistant; and Nous came forth accordingly. Besides these, the Father 
sent forth Logos. The conjunctions of Ennoea and Logos, and of Aphtharsia and 
Christ, will thus be formed; while Zoe Aionios was united to Thelema, and Nous 
to Prognosis. These, then, magnified the great light and Barbelos.</P>
<P>2. They also affirm that Autogenes was afterwards sent forth from Ennoea and 
Logos, to be a representation of the great light, and that he was greatly 
honoured, all things being rendered subject unto him. Along with him was sent 
forth Aletheia, and a conjunction was formed between Autogenes and Aletheia. But 
they declare that from the Light, which is Christ, and from Aphtharsia, four 
luminaries were sent forth to surround Autogenes; and again from Thelema and Zoe 
Aionios four other emissions took place, to wait upon these four luminaries; and 
these they name Charis (grace), Thelesis (will), Synesis (understanding), and 
Phronesis (prudence) Of these, Chaffs is connected with the great and first 
luminary: him they represent as Sorer (Saviour), and style Armogenes.
Thelesis, again, is united to the second luminary, whom they also name Raguel; 
Synesis to the third, whom they call David; and Phronesis to the fourth, whom 
they name Eleleth.</P>
<P>3. All these, then, being thus settled, Autogenes moreover produces a perfect 
and true man, whom they also call Adamas, inasmuch as neither has he himself 
ever been conquered, nor have those from whom he sprang; he also was, along with 
the first light, severed from Armogenes. Moreover, perfect knowledge was sent 
forth by Autogenes along with man, and was united to him; hence he attained to 
the knowledge of him that is above all. Invincible power was also conferred on 
him by the virgin spirit; and all things then rested in him, to sing praises to 
the great Aeon. Hence also they declare were manifested the mother, the father, 
the son; while from Anthropos and Gnosis that Tree was produced which they also 
style Gnosis itself.</P>
<P>4. Next they maintain, that from the first angel, who stands by the side of 
Monogenes, the Holy Spirit has been sent forth, whom they also term Sophia and 
Prunicus. 
He then, perceiving that all the others had consorts, while he himself was 
destitute of one, searched after a being to whom he might be united; and not 
finding one, he exerted and extended himself to the uttermost and looked down 
into the lower regions, in the expectation of there finding a consort; and still 
not meeting with one, he leaped forth [from his place] in a state of great 
impatience, [which had come upon him] because he had made his attempt without 
the good-will of his father. Afterwards, under the influence of simplicity and 
kindness, he produced a work in which were to be found ignorance and audacity. 
This work of his they declare to be Protarchontes, the former of this [lower] 
creation. But they relate that a mighty power carried him away from his mother, 
and that he settled far away from her in the lower regions, and formed the 
firmament of heaven, in which also they affirm that he dwells. And in his 
ignorance he formed those powers which are inferior to himself-angels, and 
firmaments, and all things earthly. They affirm that he, being united to 
Authadia (audacity), produced Kakia (wickedness), Zelos (emulation), Phthonos 
(envy), Erinnys (fury), and Epithymia (lust). When these were generated, the 
mother Sophia deeply grieved, fled away, departed into the upper regions, and 
became the last of the Ogdoad, reckoning it downwards. On her thus departing, he 
imagined he was the only being in existence; and on this account declared, "I am 
a jealous God, and besides me there is no one."
Such are the falsehoods which these people invent.</P>
<UL>
  <P><A name=P6676_1604194></A><FONT size=3>Chapter XXX.-Doctrines of the 
  Ophites and Sethians.</FONT></P></UL>
<P>1. Others, again, portentously declare that there exists, in the power of 
Bythus, a certain primary light, blessed, incorruptible, and infinite: this is 
the Father of all, and is styled the first man. They also maintain that his 
Ennoea, going forth from him, produced a son, and that this is the son of 
man-the second man. Below these, again, is the Holy Spirit, and under this 
superior spirit the elements were separated from each other, viz., water, 
darkness, the abyss, chaos, above which they declare the Spirit was borne, 
calling him the first woman. Afterwards, they maintain, the first man, with his 
son, delighting over the beauty of the Spirit-that is, of the woman-and shedding 
light upon her, begat by her an incorruptible light, the third male, whom they 
call Christ,-the son of the first and second man, and of the Holy Spirit, the 
first woman.</P>
<P>2. The father and son thus both had intercourse with the woman (whom they 
also call the mother of the living). When, however,
she could not bear nor receive into herself the greatness of the lights, they 
declare that she was filled to repletion, and became ebullient on the left side; 
and that thus their only son Christ, as belonging to the right side, and ever 
tending to what was higher, was immediately caught up with his mother to form an 
incorruptible Aeon. This constitutes the true and holy Church, which has become 
the appellation, the meeting together, and the union of the father of all, of 
the first man, of the son, of the second man, of Christ their son, and of the 
woman who has been mentioned.</P>
<P>3. They teach, however, that the power which proceeded from the woman by 
ebullition, being besprinkled with light, fell downward from the place occupied 
by its progenitors, yet possessing by its own will that besprinkling of light; 
and it they call Sinistra, Prunicus, and Sophia, as well as masculo-feminine. 
This being, in its simplicity, descended into the waters while they were yet in 
a state of immobility, and imparted motion to them also, wantonly acting upon 
them even to their lowest depths, and assumed from them a body. For they affirm 
that all things rushed towards and clung to that sprinkling of light, and begin 
it all round. Unless it had possessed that, it would perhaps have been totally 
absorbed in, and overwhelmed by, material substance. Being therefore bound down 
by a body which was composed of matter, and greatly burdened by it, this power 
regretted the course it had followed, and made an attempt to escape from the 
waters and ascend to its mother: it could not effect this, however, on account 
of the weight of the body lying over and around it. But feeling very ill at 
ease, it endeavoured at least to conceal that light which came from above, 
fearing lest it too might be injured by the inferior elements, as had happened 
to itself. And when it had received power from that besprinkling of light which 
it possessed, it sprang back again, and was borne aloft; and being on high, it 
extended itself, covered [a portion of space], and formed this visible heaven 
out of its body; yet remained under the heaven which it made, as still 
possessing the form of a watery body. But when it had conceived a desire for the 
light above, and had received power by all things, it laid down this body, and 
was freed from it. This body which they speak of that power as having thrown 
off, they call a female from a female.</P>
<P>4. They declare, moreover, that her son had also himself a certain breath of 
incorruption left him by his mother, and that through means of it he works; and 
becoming powerful, he himself, as they affirm, also sent forth from the waters a 
son without a mother; for they do not allow him either to have known a mother. 
His son, again, after the example of his father, sent forth another son. This 
third one, too, generated a fourth; the fourth also generated a son: they 
maintain that again a son was generated by the fifth; and the sixth, too, 
generated a seventh. Thus was the Hebdomad, according to them, completed, the 
mother possessing the eighth place; and as in the case of their generations, so 
also in regard to dignities and powers, they precede each other in turn.</P>
<P>5. They have also given names to [the several persons] in their system of 
falsehood, such as the following: he who was the first descendant of the mother 
is called Ialdabaoth;
he, again, descended from him, is named Iao; he, from this one, is called 
Sabaoth; the fourth is named Adoneus; the fifth, Eloeus; the sixth, Oreus; and 
the seventh and last of all, Astanphaeus. Moreover, they represent these 
heavens, potentates, powers, angels, and creators, as sitting in their proper 
order in heaven, according to their generation, and as invisibly ruling over 
things celestial and terrestrial. The first of them, namely Ialdabaoth, holds 
his mother in contempt, inasmuch as he produced sons and grandsons without the 
permission of any one, yea, even angels, archangels, powers, potentates, and 
dominions. After these things had been done, his sons turned to strive and 
quarrel with him about the supreme power,-conduct which deeply grieved 
Ialdabaoth, and drove him to despair. In these circumstances, he cast his eyes 
upon the subjacent dregs of matter, and fixed his desire upon it, to which they 
declare his son owes his origin. This son is Nous himself, twisted into the form 
of a serpent;
and hence were derived the spirit, the soul, and all mundane things: from this 
too were generated all oblivion, wickedness, emulation, envy, and death. They 
declare that the father imparted
still greater crookedness to this serpent-like and contorted Nous of theirs, 
when he was with their father in heaven and Paradise.</P>
<P>6. On this account, Ialdabaoth, becoming uplifted in spirit, boasted himself 
over all those things that were below him, and exclaimed, "I am father, and God, 
and above me there is no one." But his mother, hearing him speak thus, cried out 
against him, "Do not lie, Ialdabaoth: for the father of all, the first Anthropos 
(man), is above thee; and so is Anthropos the son of Anthropos." Then, as all 
were disturbed by this new voice, and by the unexpected proclamation, and as 
they were inquiring whence the noise proceeded, in order to lead them away and 
attract them to himself, they affirm that Ialdabaoth exclaimed, "Come, let us 
make man after our image."
The six powers, on hearing this, and their mother furnishing them with the idea 
of a man (in order that by means of him she might empty them of their original 
power), jointly formed a man of immense size, both in regard to breadth and 
length. But as he could merely writhe along the ground, they carried him to 
their father; Sophia so labouring in this matter, that she might empty him 
(Ialdabaoth) of the light with which he had been sprinkled, so that he might no 
longer, though still powerful, be able to lift up himself against the powers 
above. They declare, then, that by breathing into man the spirit of life, he was 
secretly emptied of his power; that hence man became a possessor of <FONT 
face="Semitica Dict">nous</FONT> (intelligence) and <FONT 
face="Semitica Dict">enthymesis</FONT> (thought); and they affirm that these are 
the faculties which partake in salvation. He [they further assert] at once gave 
thanks to the first Anthropos (man), forsaking those who had created him.</P>
<P>7. But Ialdabaoth, feeling envious at this, was pleased to form the design of 
again emptying man by means of woman, and produced a woman from his own 
enthymesis, whom that Prunicus [above mentioned] laying hold of, imperceptibly 
emptied her of power. But the others coming and admiring her beauty, named her 
Eve, and falling in love with her, begat sons by her, whom they also declare to 
be the angels. But their mother (Sophia) cunningly devised a scheme to seduce 
Eve and Adam, by means of the serpent, to transgress the command of Ialdabaoth. 
Eve listened to this as if it had proceeded from a son of God, and yielded an 
easy belief. She also persuaded Adam to eat of the tree regarding which God had 
said that they should not eat of it. They then declare that, on their thus 
eating, they attained to the knowledge of that power which is above all, and 
departed from those who had created them. 
When Prunicus perceived that the powers were thus baffled by their own creature, 
she greatly rejoiced, and again cried out, that since the father was 
incorruptible, he (Ialdabaoth) who formerly called himself the father was a 
liar; and that, while Anthropos and the first woman (the Spirit) existed 
previously, this one (Eve) sinned by committing adultery.</P>
<P>8. Ialdabaoth, however, through that oblivion in which he was involved, and 
not paying any regard to these things, cast Adam and Eve out of Paradise, 
because they had transgressed his commandment. For he had a desire to beget sons 
by Eve, but did not accomplish his wish, because his mother opposed him in every 
point, and secretly emptied Adam and Eve of the light with which they had been 
sprinkled, in order that that spirit which proceeded from the supreme power 
might participate neither in the curse nor opprobrium [caused by transgression]. 
They also teach that, thus being emptied of the divine substance, they were 
cursed by him, and cast down from heaven to this world.
But the serpent also, who was acting against the father, was cast down by him 
into this lower world; he reduced, however, under his power the angels here, and 
begat six sons, he himself forming the seventh person, after the example of that 
Hebdomad which surrounds the father. They further declare that these are the 
seven mundane demons, who always oppose and resist the human race, because it 
was on their account that their father was cast down to this lower world.</P>
<P>9. Adam and Eve previously had light, and clear, and as it were spiritual 
bodies, such as they were at their creation; but when they came to this world, 
these changed into bodies more opaque, and gross, and sluggish. Their soul also 
was feeble and languid, inasmuch as they had received from their creator a 
merely mundane inspiration. This continued until Prunicus, moved with compassion 
towards them, restored to them the sweet savour of the besprinkling of light, by 
means of which they came to a remembrance of themselves, and knew that they were 
naked, as well as that the body was a material substance, and thus recognised 
that they bore death about with them. They thereupon became patient, knowing 
that only for a time they would be enveloped in the body. They also found out 
food, through the guidance of Sophia; and when they were satisfied, they had 
carnal knowledge of each other, and begat Cain, whom the serpent, that had been 
cast down along with his sons, immediately laid hold of and destroyed by filling 
him with mundane oblivion, and urging into folly and audacity, so that, by 
slaying his brother Abel, he was the first to bring to light envy and death. 
After these, they affirm that, by the forethought of Prunicus, Seth was 
begotten, and then Norea,
from whom they represent all the rest of mankind as being descended. They were 
urged on to all kinds of wickedness by the inferior Hebdomad, and to apostasy, 
idolatry, and a general contempt for everything by the superior holy 
Hebdomad,
since the mother was always secretly opposed to them, and carefully preserved 
what was peculiarly her own, that is, the besprinkling of light. They maintain, 
moreover, that the holy Hebdomad is the seven stars which they call planets; and 
they affirm that the serpent cast down has two names, Michael and Samael.</P>
<P>10. Ialdabaoth, again, being incensed with men, because they did not worship 
or honour him as father and God, sent forth a deluge upon them, that he might at 
once destroy them all. But Sophia opposed him in this point also, and Noah and 
his family were saved in the ark by means of the besprinkling of that light 
which proceeded from her, and through it the world was again filled with 
mankind. Ialdabaoth himself chose a certain man named Abraham from among these, 
and made a covenant with him, to the effect that, if his seed continued to serve 
him, he would give to them the earth for an inheritance. Afterwards, by means of 
Moses, he brought forth Abraham's descendants from Egypt, and gave them the law, 
and made them the Jews. Among that people he chose seven days,
which they also call the holy Hebdomad. Each of these receives his own herald 
for the purpose of glorifying and proclaiming God; so that, when the rest hear 
these praises, they too may serve those who are announced as gods try the 
prophets.</P>
<P>11. Moreover, they distribute the prophets in the following manner: Moses, 
and Joshua the son of Nun, and Amos, and Habakkuk, belonged to Ialdabaoth; 
Samuel, and Nathan, and Jonah, and Micah, to Iao; Elijah, Joel, and Zechariah to 
Sabaoth; Isaiah, Ezekiel, Jeremiah, and Daniel, to Adohai; Tobias and Haggai to 
Eloi; Michaiah and Nahum to Oreus; Esdras and Zephaniah to Astanphaeus. Each one 
of these, then, glorifies his own father and God, and they maintain that Sophia, 
herself has also spoken many things through them regarding the first Anthropos 
(man), 
and concerning that Christ who is above, thus admonishing and reminding men of 
the incorruptible light, the first Anthropos, and of the descent of Christ. The 
[other] powers being terrified by these things, and marvelling at the novelty of 
those things which were announced by the prophets, Prunicus brought it about by 
means of Ialdabaoth (who knew not what he did), that emissions of two men took 
place, the one from the barren Elizabeth, and the other from the Virgin 
Mary.</P>
<P>12. And since she herself had no rest either in heaven or on earth, she 
invoked her mother to assist her in her distress. Upon this, her mother, the 
first woman, was moved with compassion towards her daughter, on her repentance, 
and begged from the first man that Christ should be sent to her assistance, who, 
being sent forth, descended to his sister, and to the besprinkling of light. 
When he recognised her (that is, the Sophia below), her brother descended to 
her, and announced his advent through means of John, and prepared the baptism of 
repentance, and adopted Jesus beforehand, in order that on Christ descending he 
might find a pure vessel, and that by the son of that Ialdabaoth the woman might 
be announced by Christ. They further declare that he descended through the seven 
heavens, having assumed the likeness of their sons, and gradually emptied them 
of their power. For they maintain that the whole besprinkling of light rushed to 
him, and that Christ, descending to this world, first clothed his sister Sophia 
[with it], and that then both exulted in the mutual refreshment they felt in 
each other's society: this scene they describe as relating to bridegroom and 
bride. But Jesus, inasmuch as he was begotten of the Virgin through the agency 
of God, was wiser, purer, and more righteous than all other men: Christ united 
to Sophia descended into him, and thus Jesus Christ was produced.</P>
<P>13. They affirm that many of his disciples were not aware of the descent of 
Christ into him; but that, when Christ did descend on Jesus, he then began to 
work miracles, and heal, and announce the unknown Father, and openly to confess 
himself the son of the first man. The powers and the father of Jesus were angry 
at these proceedings, and laboured to destroy him; and when he was being led 
away for this purpose, they say that Christ himself, along with Sophia, departed 
from him into the state of an incorruptible Aeon, while Jesus was crucified. 
Christ, however, was not forgetful of his Jesus, but sent down a certain energy 
into him from above, which raised him up again in the body, which they call both 
animal and spiritual; for he sent the mundane parts back again into the world. 
When his disciples saw that he had risen, they did not recognise him-no, not 
even Jesus himself, by whom he rose again from the dead. And they assert that 
this very great error prevailed among his disciples, that they imagined he had 
risen in a mundane body, not knowing that "flesh
and blood do not attain to the kingdom of God."</P>
<P>14. They strove to establish the descent and ascent of Christ, by the fact 
that neither before his baptism, nor after his resurrection from the dead, do 
his disciples state that he did any mighty works, not being aware that Jesus was 
united to Christ, and the incorruptible Aeon to the Hebdomad; and they declare 
his mundane body to be of the same nature as that of animals. But after his 
resurrection he tarried [on earth] eighteen months; and knowledge descending 
into him from above, he taught what was clear. He instructed a few of his 
disciples, whom he knew to be capable of understanding so great mysteries, in 
these things, and was then received up into heaven, Christ sitting down at the 
right hand of his father Ialdabaoth, that he may receive to himself the souls of 
those who have known them,
after they have laid aside their mundane flesh, thus enriching himself without 
the knowledge or perception of his father; so that, in proportion as Jesus 
enriches himself with holy souls, to such an extent does his father suffer loss 
and is diminished, being emptied of his own power by these souls. For he will 
not now possess holy souls to send them down again into the world, except those 
only which are of his substance, that is, those into which he has breathed. But 
the consummation [of all things] will take place, when the whole besprinkling of 
the spirit of light is gathered together, and is carried off to form an 
incorruptible Aeon.</P>
<P>15. Such are the opinions which prevail among these persons, by whom, like 
the Lernaean hydra, a many-headed beast has been generated from the school of 
Valentinus. For some of them assert that Sophia herself became the serpent; on 
which account she was hostile to the creator of Adam, and implanted knowledge in 
men, for which reason the serpent was called wiser than all others. Moreover, by 
the position of our intestines, through which the food is conveyed, and by the 
fact that they possess such a figure, our internal configuration
in the form of a serpent reveals our hidden generatrix.</P>
<UL>
  <P><A name=P6707_1623941></A><FONT size=3>Chapter XXXI.-Doctrines of the 
  Cainites.</FONT></P></UL>
<P>1. Others again declare that Cain derived his being from the Power above, and 
acknowledge that Esau, Korah, the Sodomites, and all such persons, are related 
to themselves. On this account, they add, they have been assailed by the 
Creator, yet no one of them has suffered injury. For Sophia was in the habit of 
carrying off that which belonged to her from them to herself. They declare that 
Judas the traitor was thoroughly acquainted with these things, and that he 
alone, knowing the truth as no others did, accomplished the mystery of the 
betrayal; by him all things, both earthly and heavenly, were thus thrown into 
confusion. They produce a fictitious history of this kind, which they style the 
Gospel of Judas.</P>
<P>2. I have also made a collection of their writings in which they advocate the 
abolition of the doings of Hystera.
Moreover, they call this Hystera the creator of heaven and earth. They also 
hold, like Carpocrates, that men cannot be saved until they have gone through 
all kinds of experience. An angel, they maintain, attends them in every one of 
their sinful and abominable actions, and urges them to venture on audacity and 
incur pollution. Whatever may be the nature
of the action, they declare that they do it in the name of the angel, saying, "O 
thou angel, I use thy work; O thou power, I accomplish thy operation!" And they 
maintain that this is "perfect knowledge," without shrinking to rush into such 
actions as it is not lawful even to name.</P>
<P>3. It was necessary clearly to prove, that, as their very opinions and 
regulations exhibit them, those who are of the school of Valentinus derive their 
origin from such mothers, fathers, and ancestors, and also to bring forward 
their doctrines, with the hope that perchance some of them, exercising 
repentance and returning to the only Creator, and God the Former of the 
universe, may obtain salvation, and that others may not henceforth be drown away 
by their wicked, although plausible, persuasions, imagining that they will 
obtain from them the knowledge of some greater and more sublime mysteries. But 
let them rather, learning to good effect from us the wicked tenets of these men, 
look with contempt upon their doctrines, while at the same time they pity those 
who, still cleaving to these miserable and baseless fables, have reached such a 
pitch of arrogance as to reckon themselves superior to all others on account of 
such knowledge, or, as it should rather be called, ignorance. They have now been 
fully exposed; and simply to exhibit their sentiments, is to obtain a victory 
over them.</P>
<P>4. Wherefore I have laboured to bring forward, and make clearly manifest, the 
utterly ill-conditioned carcase of this miserable little fox.
For there will not now be need of many words to overturn their system of 
doctrine, when it has been made manifest to all. It is as when, on a beast 
hiding itself in a wood, and by rushing forth from it is in the habit of 
destroying multitudes, one who beats round the wood and thoroughly explores it, 
so as to compel the animal to break cover, does not strive to capture it, seeing 
that it is truly a ferocious beast; but those present can then watch and avoid 
its assaults, and can cast darts at it from all sides, and wound it, and finally 
slay that destructive brute. So, in our case, since we have brought their hidden 
mysteries, which they keep in silence among themselves, to the light, it will 
not now be necessary to use many words in destroying their system of opinions. 
For it is now in thy power, and in the power of all thy associates, to 
familiarize yourselves with what has been said, to overthrow their wicked and 
undigested doctrines, and to set forth doctrines agreeable to the truth. Since 
then the case is so, I shall, according to promise, and as my ability serves, 
labour to overthrow them, by refuting them all in the following book. Even to 
give an account of them is a tedious affair, as thou seest.
But I shall furnish means for overthrowing them, by meeting all their opinions 
in the order in which they have been described, that I may not only expose the 
wild beast to view, but may inflict wounds upon it from every side.</P>
