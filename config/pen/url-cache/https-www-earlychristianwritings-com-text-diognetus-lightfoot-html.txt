<p> The Epistle TO Diognetus</p>

<p>
CHAPTER 1<br>
 1:1 Since I see, most excellent Diognetus, that thou<br>
art exceedingly anxious to understand the religion of<br>
the Christians, and that thy enquiries respecting them<br>
are distinctly and carefully made, as to what God they<br>
trust and how they worship Him, that they all<br>
disregard the world and despise death, and take no<br>
account of those who are regarded as gods by the<br>
Greeks, neither observe the superstition of the Jews,<br>
and as to the nature of the affection which they<br>
entertain one to another, and of this new development<br>
or interest, which has entered into men's lives now<br>
and not before: I gladly welcome this zeal in thee,<br>
and I ask of God, Who supplieth both the speaking and<br>
the hearing to us, that it may be granted to myself to<br>
speak in such a way that thou mayest be made better by<br>
the hearing, and to thee that thou mayest so listen<br>
that I the speaker may not be disappointed.</p>

<p>CHAPTER 2<br>
 2:1 Come then, clear thyself of all the<br>
prepossessions which occupy thy mind, and throw off<br>
the habit which leadeth thee astray, and become a new<br>
man, as it were, from the beginning, as one who would<br>
listen to a new story, even as thou thyself didst<br>
confess. See not only with thine eyes, but with thine<br>
intellect also, of what substance or of what form they<br>
chance to be whom ye call and regard as gods.<br>
 2:2 Is not one of them stone, like that which we<br>
tread under foot, and another bronze, no better than<br>
the vessels which are forged for our use, and another<br>
wood, which has already become rotten, and another<br>
silver, which needs a man to guard it lest it be<br>
stolen, and another iron, which is corroded with rust,<br>
and another earthenware, not a whit more comely than<br>
that which is supplied for the most dishonourable<br>
service?<br>
 2:3 Are not all these of perishable matter? Are they<br>
not forged by iron and fire? Did not the sculptor make<br>
one, and the brass-founder another, and the<br>
silversmith another, and the potter another? Before<br>
they were moulded into this shape by the crafts of<br>
these several artificers, was it not possible for each<br>
one of them to have been changed in form and made to<br>
resemble these several utensils? Might not the vessels<br>
which are now made out of the same material, if they<br>
met with the same artificers, be made like unto such<br>
as these?<br>
 2:4 Could not these things which are now worshipped<br>
by you, by human hands again be made vessels like the<br>
rest? Are not they all deaf and blind, are they not<br>
soul-less, senseless, motionless? Do they not all rot<br>
and decay?<br>
 2:5 These things ye call gods, to these ye are<br>
slaves, these ye worship; and ye end by becoming<br>
altogether like unto them.<br>
 2:6 Therefore ye hate the Christians, because they<br>
do not consider these to be gods.<br>
 2:7 For do not ye yourselves, who now regard and<br>
worship them, much more despise them? Do ye not much<br>
rather mock and insult them, worshipping those that<br>
are of stone and earthenware unguarded, but shutting<br>
up those that are of silver and gold by night, and<br>
setting guards over them by day, to prevent their<br>
being stolen?<br>
 2:8 And as for the honours which ye think to offer<br>
to them, if they are sensible of them, ye rather<br>
punish them thereby, whereas, if they are insensible,<br>
ye reproach them by propitiating them with the blood<br>
and fat of victims.<br>
 2:9 Let one of yourselves undergo this treatment,<br>
let him submit to these things being done to him. Nay,<br>
not so much as a single individual will willingly<br>
submit to such punishment, for he has sensibility and<br>
reason; but a stone submits, because it is insensible.<br>
Therefore ye convict his sensibility.<br>
 2:10 Well, I could say much besides concerning the<br>
Christians not being enslaved to such gods as these;<br>
but if any one should think what has been said<br>
insufficient, I hold it superfluous to say more.</p>

<p>CHAPTER 3<br>
 3:1 In the next place, I fancy that thou art chiefly<br>
anxious to hear about their not practising their<br>
religion in the same way as the Jews.<br>
 3:2 The Jews then, so far as they abstain from the<br>
mode of worship described above, do well in claiming<br>
to reverence one God of the universe and to regard Him<br>
as Master; but so far as they offer Him this worship<br>
in methods similar to those already mentioned, they<br>
are altogether at fault.<br>
 3:3 For whereas the Greeks, by offering these things<br>
to senseless and deaf images, make an exhibition of<br>
stupidity, the Jews considering that they are<br>
presenting them to God, as if He were in need of them,<br>
ought in all reason to count it folly and not<br>
religious worship.<br>
 3:4 For He that made the heaven and the earth and<br>
all things that are therein, and furnisheth us all<br>
with what we need, cannot Himself need any of these<br>
things which He Himself supplieth to them that imagine<br>
they are giving them to Him.<br>
 3:5 But those who think to perform sacrifices to Him<br>
with blood and fat and whole burnt offerings, and to<br>
honour Him with such honours, seem to me in no way<br>
different from those who show the same respect towards<br>
deaf images; for the one class think fit to make<br>
offerings to things unable to participate in the<br>
honour, the other class to One Who is in need of<br>
nothing.</p>

<p>CHAPTER 4<br>
 4:1 But again their scruples concerning meats, and<br>
their superstition relating to the sabbath and the<br>
vanity of their circumcision and the dissimulation of<br>
their fasting and new moons, I do [not] suppose you<br>
need to learn from me, are ridiculous and unworthy of<br>
any consideration.<br>
 4:2 For of the things created by God for the use of<br>
man to receive some as created well, but to decline<br>
others as useless and superfluous, is not this<br>
impious?<br>
 4:3 And again to lie against God, as if He forbad us<br>
to do any good thing on the sabbath day, is not this<br>
profane?<br>
 4:4 Again, to vaunt the mutilation of the flesh as a<br>
token of election as though for this reason they were<br>
particularly beloved by God, is not this ridiculous?<br>
 4:5 And to watch the stars and the moon and to keep<br>
the observance of months and of days, and to<br>
distinguish the arrangements of God and the changes of<br>
the seasons according to their own impulses, making<br>
some into festivals and others into times of mourning,<br>
who would regard this as an exhibition of godliness<br>
and not much more of folly?<br>
 4:6 That the Christians are right therefore in<br>
holding aloof from the common silliness and error of<br>
the Jews and from their excessive fussiness and pride,<br>
I consider that thou hast been sufficiently<br>
instructed; but as regards the mystery of their own<br>
religion, expect not that thou canst be instructed by<br>
man.</p>

<p>CHAPTER 5<br>
 5:1 For Christians are not distinguished from the<br>
rest of mankind either in locality or in speech or in<br>
customs.<br>
 5:2 For they dwell not somewhere in cities of their<br>
own, neither do they use some different language, nor<br>
practise an extraordinary kind of life.<br>
 5:3 Nor again do they possess any invention<br>
discovered by any intelligence or study of ingenious<br>
men, nor are they masters of any human dogma as some<br>
are.<br>
 5:4 But while they dwell in cities of Greeks and<br>
barbarians as the lot of each is cast, and follow the<br>
native customs in dress and food and the other<br>
arrangements of life, yet the constitution of their<br>
own citizenship, which they set forth, is marvellous,<br>
and confessedly contradicts expectation.<br>
 5:5 They dwell in their own countries, but only as<br>
sojourners; they bear their share in all things as<br>
citizens, and they endure all hardships as strangers.<br>
Every foreign country is a fatherland to them, and<br>
every fatherland is foreign.<br>
 5:6 They marry like all other men and they beget<br>
children; but they do not cast away their offspring.<br>
 5:7 They have their meals in common, but not their<br>
wives.<br>
 5:8 They find themselves in the flesh, and yet they<br>
live not after the flesh.<br>
 5:9 Their existence is on earth, but their<br>
citizenship is in heaven.<br>
 5:10 They obey the established laws, and they<br>
surpass the laws in their own lives.<br>
 5:11 They love all men, and they are persecuted by<br>
all.<br>
 5:12 They are ignored, and yet they are condemned.<br>
They are put to death, and yet they are endued with<br>
life.<br>
 5:13 They are in beggary, and yet they make many<br>
rich. They are in want of all things, and yet they<br>
abound in all things.<br>
 5:14 They are dishonoured, and yet they are<br>
glorified in their dishonour. They are evil spoken of,<br>
and yet they are vindicated.<br>
 5:15 They are reviled, and they bless; they are<br>
insulted, and they respect.<br>
 5:16 Doing good they are punished as evil-doers;<br>
being punished they rejoice, as if they were thereby<br>
quickened by life.<br>
 5:17 War is waged against them as aliens by the<br>
Jews, and persecution is carried on against them by<br>
the Greeks, and yet those that hate them cannot tell<br>
the reason of their hostility.</p>

<p>CHAPTER 6<br>
 6:1 In a word, what the soul is in a body, this the<br>
Christians are in the world.<br>
 6:2 The soul is spread through all the members of<br>
the body, and Christians through the divers cities of<br>
the world.<br>
 6:3 The soul hath its abode in the body, and yet it<br>
is not of the body. So Christians have their abode in<br>
the world, and yet they are not of the world.<br>
 6:4 The soul which is invisible is guarded in the<br>
body which is visible: so Christians are recognised as<br>
being in the world, and yet their religion remaineth<br>
invisible.<br>
 6:5 The flesh hateth the soul and wageth war with<br>
it, though it receiveth no wrong, because it is<br>
forbidden to indulge in pleasures; so the world hateth<br>
Christians, though it receiveth no wrong from them,<br>
because they set themselves against its pleasures.<br>
 6:6 The soul loveth the flesh which hateth it, and<br>
the members: so Christians love those that hate them.<br>
 6:7 The soul is enclosed in the body, and yet itself<br>
holdeth the body together; so Christians are kept in<br>
the world as in a prison-house, and yet they<br>
themselves hold the world together.<br>
 6:8 The soul though itself immortal dwelleth in a<br>
mortal tabernacle; so Christians sojourn amidst<br>
perishable things, while they look for the<br>
imperishability which is in the heavens.<br>
 6:9 The soul when hardly treated in the matter of<br>
meats and drinks is improved; and so Christians when<br>
punished increase more and more daily.<br>
 6:10 So great is the office for which God hath<br>
appointed them, and which it is not lawful for them to<br>
decline.</p>

<p>CHAPTER 7<br>
 7:1 For it is no earthly discovery, as I said, which<br>
was committed to them, neither do they care to guard<br>
so carefully any mortal invention, nor have they<br>
entrusted to them the dispensation of human mysteries.<br>
 7:2 But truly the Almighty Creator of the Universe,<br>
the Invisible God Himself from heaven planted among<br>
men the truth and the holy teaching which surpasseth<br>
the wit of man, and fixed it firmly in their hearts,<br>
not as any man might imagine, by sending (to mankind)<br>
a subaltern, or angel, or ruler, or one of those that<br>
direct the affairs of earth, or one of those who have<br>
been entrusted with the dispensations in heaven, but<br>
the very Artificer and Creator of the Universe<br>
Himself, by Whom He made the heavens, by Whom He<br>
enclosed the sea in its proper bounds, Whose mysteries<br>
all the elements faithfully observe, from Whom [the<br>
sun] hath received even the measure of the courses of<br>
the day to keep them, Whom the moon obeys as He bids<br>
her shine by night, Whom the stars obey as they follow<br>
the course of the moon, by Whom all things are ordered<br>
and bounded and placed in subjection, the heavens and<br>
the things that are in the heavens, the earth and the<br>
things that are in the earth, the sea and the things<br>
that are in the sea, fire, air, abyss, the things that<br>
are in the heights, the things that are in the depths,<br>
the things that are between the two. Him He sent unto<br>
them.<br>
 2:3 Was He sent, think you, as any man might<br>
suppose, to establish a sovereignty, to inspire fear<br>
and terror?<br>
 2:4 Not so. But in gentleness [and] meekness has He<br>
sent Him, as a king might send his son who is a king.<br>
He sent Him, as sending God; He sent Him, as [a man]<br>
unto men; He sent Him, as Saviour, as using<br>
persuasion, not force: for force is no attribute of<br>
God.<br>
 2:5 He sent Him, as summoning, not as persecuting;<br>
He sent Him, as loving, not as judging.<br>
 2:6 For He will send Him in judgment, and who shall<br>
endure His presence? ...<br>
 2:7 [Dost thou not see] them thrown to wild beasts<br>
that so they may deny the Lord, and yet not overcome?<br>
 2:8 Dost thou not see that the more of them are<br>
punished, just so many others abound?<br>
 2:9 These look not like the works of a man; they are<br>
the power of God; they are proofs of His presence.</p>

<p>CHAPTER 8<br>
 8:1 For what man at all had any knowledge what God<br>
was, before He came?<br>
 8:2 Or dost thou accept the empty and nonsensical<br>
statements of those pretentious philosophers: of whom<br>
some said that God was fire (they call that God,<br>
whereunto they themselves shall go), and others water,<br>
and others some other of the elements which were<br>
created by God?<br>
 8:3 And yet if any of these statements is worthy of<br>
acceptance, any one other created thing might just as<br>
well be made out to be God.<br>
 8:4 Nay, all this is the quackery and deceit of the<br>
magicians;<br>
 8:5 and no man has either seen or recognised Him,<br>
but He revealed Himself.<br>
 8:6 And He revealed (Himself) by faith, whereby<br>
alone it is given to see God.<br>
 8:7 For God, the Master and Creator of the Universe,<br>
Who made all things and arranged them in order, was<br>
found to be not only friendly to men, but also long-<br>
suffering.<br>
 8:8 And such indeed He was always, and is, and will<br>
be, kindly and good and dispassionate and true, and He<br>
alone is good.<br>
 8:9 And having conceived a great and unutterable<br>
scheme He communicated it to His Son alone.<br>
 8:10 For so long as He kept and guarded His wise<br>
design as a mystery, He seemed to neglect us and to be<br>
careless about us.<br>
 8:11 But when He revealed it through His beloved<br>
Son, and manifested the purpose which He had prepared<br>
from the beginning, He gave us all these gifts at<br>
once, participation in His benefits, and sight and<br>
understanding of (mysteries) which none of us ever<br>
would have expected.</p>

<p>CHAPTER 9<br>
 9:1 Having thus planned everything already in His<br>
mind with His Son, He permitted us during the former<br>
time to be borne along by disorderly impulses as we<br>
desired, led astray by pleasures and lusts, not at all<br>
because He took delight in our sins, but because He<br>
bore with us, not because He approved of the past<br>
season of iniquity, but because He was creating the<br>
present season of righteousness, that, being convicted<br>
in the past time by our own deeds as unworthy of life,<br>
we might now be made deserving by the goodness of God,<br>
and having made clear our inability to enter into the<br>
kingdom of God of ourselves, might be enabled by the<br>
ability of God.<br>
 9:2 And when our iniquity had been fully<br>
accomplished, and it had been made perfectly manifest<br>
that punishment and death were expected as its<br>
recompense, and the season came which God had<br>
ordained, when henceforth He should manifest His<br>
goodness and power (O the exceeding great kindness and<br>
love of God), He hated us not, neither rejected us,<br>
nor bore us malice, but was long-suffering and<br>
patient, and in pity for us took upon Himself our<br>
sins, and Himself parted with His own Son as a ransom<br>
for us, the holy for the lawless, the guileless for<br>
the evil, _the just for the unjust,_ the incorruptible<br>
for the corruptible, the immortal for the mortal.<br>
 9:3 For what else but His righteousness would have<br>
covered our sins?<br>
 9:4 In whom was it possible for us lawless and<br>
ungodly men to have been justified, save only in the<br>
Son of God?<br>
 9:5 O the sweet exchange, O the inscrutable<br>
creation, O the unexpected benefits; that the iniquity<br>
of many should be concealed in One Righteous Man, and<br>
the righteousness of One should justify many that are<br>
iniquitous!<br>
 9:6 Having then in the former time demonstrated the<br>
inability of our nature to obtain life, and having now<br>
revealed a Saviour able to save even creatures which<br>
have no ability, He willed that for both reasons we<br>
should believe in His goodness and should regard Him<br>
as nurse, father, teacher, counsellor, physician,<br>
mind, light, honour, glory, strength and life.</p>

<p>CHAPTER 10<br>
 10:1 This faith if thou also desirest, apprehend<br>
first full knowledge of the Father.<br>
 10:2 _For God loved_ men for whose sake He made the<br>
world, to whom He subjected all things that are in the<br>
earth, to whom He gave reason and mind, whom alone He<br>
permitted to look up to heaven, whom He created after<br>
His own image, to whom _He sent His only begotten<br>
Son,_ to whom He promised the kingdom which is in<br>
heaven, and will give it to those that have loved Him.<br>
 10:3 And when thou hast attained to this full<br>
knowledge, with what joy thinkest thou that thou wilt<br>
be filled, or how wilt thou love Him that so loved<br>
thee before?<br>
 10:4 And loving Him thou wilt be an imitator of His<br>
goodness. And marvel not that a man can be an imitator<br>
of God. He can, if God willeth it.<br>
 10:5 For happiness consisteth not in lordship over<br>
one's neighbours, nor in desiring to have more than<br>
weaker men, nor in possessing wealth and using force<br>
to inferiors; neither can any one imitate God in these<br>
matters; nay, these lie outside His greatness.<br>
 10:6 But whosoever taketh upon himself the burden of<br>
his neighbour, whosoever desireth to benefit one that<br>
is worse off in that in which he himself is superior,<br>
whosoever by supplying to those that are in want<br>
possessions which he received from God becomes a God<br>
to those who receive them from him, he is an imitator<br>
of God.<br>
 10:7 Then, though thou art placed on earth, thou<br>
shalt behold that God liveth in heaven; then shalt<br>
thou begin to declare the mysteries of God; then shalt<br>
thou both love and admire those that are punished<br>
because they will not deny God; then shalt thou<br>
condemn the deceit and error of the world; when thou<br>
shalt perceive the true life which is in heaven, when<br>
thou shalt despise the apparent death which is here on<br>
earth, when thou shalt fear the real death, which is<br>
reserved for those that shall be condemned to the<br>
eternal fire that shall punish those delivered over to<br>
it unto the end.<br>
 10:8 Then shalt thou admire those who endure for<br>
righteousness' sake the fire that is for a season, and<br>
shalt count them blessed when thou perceivest that<br>
fire ...<br>

<p>CHAPTER 11<br>
 11:1 Mine are no strange discourses nor perverse<br>
questionings, but having been a disciple of Apostles I<br>
come forward as a teacher of the Gentiles, ministering<br>
worthily to them, as they present themselves disciples<br>
of the truth, the lessons which have been handed down.<br>
 11:2 For who that has been rightly taught and has<br>
entered into friendship with the Word does not seek to<br>
learn distinctly the lessons revealed openly by the<br>
Word to the disciples; to whom the Word appeared and<br>
declared them, speaking plainly, not perceived by the<br>
unbelieving, but relating them to disciples who being<br>
reckoned faithful by Him were taught the mysteries of<br>
the Father?<br>
 11:3 For which cause He sent forth the Word, that He<br>
might appear unto the world, Who being dishonoured by<br>
the people, and preached by the Apostles, was believed<br>
in by the Gentiles.<br>
 11:4 This Word, Who was from the beginning, Who<br>
appeared as new and yet was proved to be old, and is<br>
engendered always young in the hearts of saints,<br>
 11:5 He, I say, Who is eternal, Who to-day was<br>
accounted a Son, through Whom the Church is enriched<br>
and grace is unfolded and multiplied among the saints,<br>
grace which confers understanding, which reveals<br>
mysteries, which announces seasons, which rejoices<br>
over the faithful, which is bestowed upon those who<br>
seek her, even those by whom the pledges of faith are<br>
not broken, nor the boundaries of the fathers<br>
overstepped.<br>
 11:6 Whereupon the fear of the law is sung, and the<br>
grace of the prophets is recognised, and the faith of<br>
the gospels is established, and the tradition of the<br>
apostles is preserved, and the joy of the Church<br>
exults.<br>
 11:7 If thou grieve not this grace, thou shalt<br>
understand the discourses which the Word holds by the<br>
mouth of those whom He desires when He wishes.<br>
 11:8 For in all things, that by the will of the<br>
commanding Word we were moved to utter with much<br>
pains, we become sharers with you, through love of the<br>
things revealed unto us.</p>

<p>CHAPTER 12<br>
 12:1 Confronted with these truths and listening to<br>
them with attention, ye shall know how much God<br>
bestoweth on those that love (Him) rightly, who become<br>
a Paradise of delight, a tree bearing all manner of<br>
fruits and flourishing, growing up in themselves and<br>
adorned with various fruits.<br>
 12:2 For in this garden a tree of knowledge and a<br>
tree of life hath been planted; yet the tree of<br>
knowledge does not kill, but disobedience kills;<br>
 12:3 for the scriptures state clearly how God from<br>
the beginning planted a tree [of knowledge and a tree]<br>
of life in the midst of Paradise, revealing life<br>
through knowledge; and because our first parents used<br>
it not genuinely they were made naked by the deceit of<br>
the serpent.<br>
 12:4 For neither is there life without knowledge,<br>
nor sound knowledge without true life; therefore the<br>
one (tree) is planted near the other.<br>
 12:5 Discerning the force of this and blaming the<br>
knowledge which is exercised apart from the truth of<br>
the injunction which leads to life, the apostle says,<br>
_Knowledge puffeth up, but charity edifieth._<br>
 12:6 For the man who supposes that he knows anything<br>
without the true knowledge which is testified by the<br>
life, is ignorant, he is deceived by the serpent,<br>
because he loved not life; whereas he who with fear<br>
recognises and desires life plants in hope expecting<br>
fruit.<br>
 12:7 Let your heart be knowledge, and your life true<br>
reason, duly comprehended.<br>
 12:8 Whereof if thou bear the tree and pluck the<br>
fruit, thou shalt ever gather the harvest which God<br>
looks for, which serpent toucheth not, nor deceit<br>
infecteth, neither is Eve corrupted, but is believed<br>
on as a virgin,<br>
 12:9 and salvation is set forth, and the apostles<br>
are filled with understanding, and the passover of the<br>
Lord goes forward, and the congregations are gathered<br>
together, and [all things] are arranged in order, and<br>
as He teacheth the saints the Word is gladdened,<br>
through Whom the Father is glorified, to Whom be glory<br>
for ever and ever. Amen.</p>
