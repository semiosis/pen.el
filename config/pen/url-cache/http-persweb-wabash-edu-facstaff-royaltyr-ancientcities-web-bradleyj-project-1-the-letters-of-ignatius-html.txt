<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Ignatius wrote the first three letters while
docked at port in Smyrna. He wrote these letters so the priests
and bishops he met with could take them back to their congregations.
Ignatius' trip to Rome was quite popular and many people traveled
great distances to meet him at the various stops his ship made.
While stopped in Smyrna Ignatius also met with his good friend
<A HREF="http://www.geocities.com/Athens/Ithaca/7730/Christian_martyrs/Polycarp.html">Polycarp</A>.
Below are links to the Letters:</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Ignatius' stop was quite short. The next stop
Ignatius' boat made was in Traos. Here he wrote three more letters,
two to churches in the area, and one to his friend Polycarp.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">While in Traos, Ignatius also found out that
the Christians in Rome were planning to stop the execution. Ignatius
did not agree with their plan, however, because he felt that the
only way to attain heaven was to become a martyr. Therefore, Ignatius
wrote a letter to the Church at Rome. This letter is annotated.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Ignatius was set on becoming a martyr, and
his followers wrote a letter about it.</FONT></P>

<P><A HREF="The%20Second%20Apology%20of%20Justin.htm"><FONT SIZE="+1">The
Second Apology of Justin</FONT></A></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">The Apology of Justin is a court defense of
the Christian faith. Although Justin wrote this apology in an
attempt to avoid martyrdom, one can tell by reading it that he
did not do the best job. In fact, there are parts of the letter
where he is almost mocking the Romans who are killing the Christians.
Justin states that for a Christian to meet death is for him to
truly live. For a Christian's life here on earth is merely a gateway
to the true life, eternity in heaven. Justin, like Ignatius and
Polycarp, also became a martyr.</FONT></P>
