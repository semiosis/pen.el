<h2>14<tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;</tt>The Next Stage</h2>
A large collection of Haskell resources is available on the web at
<tt>haskell.org</tt>.  Here you will find compilers, demos, papers, and much
valuable information about Haskell and functional programming.
Haskell compilers or interpreters run on almost all hardware and
operating systems.  The Hugs system is both small and portable -- it
is an excellent vehicle for learning Haskell. <p>
