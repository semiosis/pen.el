      <p>Babashka is amazing. It&rsquo;s replaced Bash for 99.999% of my scripting needs. I thought it might be useful to describe my approach to writing Babashka scripts and compare it to how I used to write Bash.</p>
<h1 id="welcome">
  Welcome
  <a href="#welcome" class="h-anchor" aria-hidden="true">#</a>
</h1>
<p>If you aren&rsquo;t familiar with <a href="https://babashka.org/">Babashka</a>, it&rsquo;s a fast-starting Clojure runtime. Most Clojure code runs on the JVM, which has great power but not the fastest startup, meaning it isn&rsquo;t a great fit for command line scripting. Babashka bridges this gap by leveraging <a href="https://www.graalvm.org/">GraalVM</a> to make a Clojure-compatible runtime that starts instantly. Check out the <a href="https://book.babashka.org/">Babashka Book</a> for more information.</p>
<p>In this post, I&rsquo;ll start off by showing why Bash scripting annoyed me and how I tried to bring Clojure into my scripting before finding (and loving) Babashka. Then I&rsquo;ll walk through a couple ways I approach writing scripts and then finish off with a neat trick that combines power with ease of use.</p>
<h1 id="bashing-scripts">
  Bashing scripts
  <a href="#bashing-scripts" class="h-anchor" aria-hidden="true">#</a>
</h1>
<p>In the time before the Babashkanaissance, I would usually reach for Bash<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> to write small automation scripts. These scripts are the glue that fits between built-in commands and my development needs. I&rsquo;ve accumulated quite a few of these over the years, and they&rsquo;ve greatly enhanced my ability to get things done quickly.</p>
<p>The best thing about Bash is that it&rsquo;s quick to get started. Throw a few commands in a file and you have something useful. For me, the problem with Bash was that any time I wanted to do any of the following, I would have to open my web browser and search for examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>Any conditional test (does this file exist? is this variable set?)</li>
<li>Conditionals themselves (how many brackets? do I have to quote the variables?)</li>
<li>Extract common code out into a function (how do I pass arguments? what about return values?)</li>
<li>Collect up data and loop over it (basic syntax of a loop? how to terminate early?)</li>
<li>Process command line arguments and provide a <code>--help</code> output (long and short options? defaults and required arguments?)</li>
</ul>
<p>Then there&rsquo;s a whole class of things that are possible, but rather arcane in Bash, such as maps, arrays, and string substitution.</p>
<p>Most of these things would probably become second nature if I wrote Bash more often, but most of my time is usually spent working on a larger application in a different language. I think the issue is that the syntax and semantics of the language are enough different from any language I&rsquo;ve spent a serious amount of time with (Java, Python, Go, Clojure, etc), that I can&rsquo;t tie any knowledge I learn to another set of information in my head.</p>
<p>So, I was stuck re-learning it each time I wrote a little script. It was a relatively small price to pay for the benefit of these small scripts.</p>
<h1 id="bringing-some-clojure-to-the-problem">
  Bringing some Clojure to the problem
  <a href="#bringing-some-clojure-to-the-problem" class="h-anchor" aria-hidden="true">#</a>
</h1>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been a fan of Clojure for a while, and so I tried using it for command line scripts. Unfortunately, due to its hosted runtime (the JVM), startup time was too long for scripts that only lived a few seconds. I was excited when <a href="https://planck-repl.org/">planck</a> and <a href="https://github.com/anmonteiro/lumo">lumo</a>, both self-hosted ClojureScript runtimes, arrived on the scene. They satisfied the fast-startup requirement, but they bottomed out in the Javascript ecosystem and it&rsquo;s reliance on a single thread and callback-driven I/O. I have a few small experiments from back then, but it never caught on because it was difficult to call programs and read or write data, something that comes up rather often in command line scripts.</p>
<p>Then, in the middle of 2019, Babashka arrived. It was different. Because it was based on the Java ecosystem, I could use <code>spit</code> and <code>slurp</code> as well as the <code>clojure.java.io</code> namespace to access the filesystem. I could execute other programs with <code>clojure.java.shell</code>. But it didn&rsquo;t stop there. Babashka also had command line options to automatically parse and emit data (<code>-i</code>, <code>-o</code>, <code>-I</code>, <code>-O</code>) which made it easier to write scripts that fit into pipelines. And there were Babashka-specific namespaces that made terminal and scripting tasks easier: <code>babashka.process</code> for running other programs, <code>babashka.fs</code> for filesystem operations, <code>babashka.deps</code> for dynamically adding dependencies, and many more. These namespaces drew Babashka closer to it&rsquo;s host environment (the terminal), making it more powerful in the process.</p>
<p>I began reaching for Babashka more and more when I needed a small script or tool to enhance my environment. These days, my scripts tend to take one of two paths toward completion: either as a single file or in my script incubator.</p>
<h1 id="quick-self-contained-scripts">
  Quick, self-contained scripts
  <a href="#quick-self-contained-scripts" class="h-anchor" aria-hidden="true">#</a>
</h1>
<p>Most of my scripts are of this variety. They are usually fewer than a couple dozen lines and are written in the fit of frustrated energy that occurs when there&rsquo;s a difference between what I need and the tools in front of me.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a template of what I usually start off with:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-clojure" data-lang="clojure"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#f92672">#</span>!/usr/bin/env bb <span style="color:#75715e">;; [1]</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>(<span style="color:#66d9ef">ns </span>fooscript) <span style="color:#75715e">;; [2]</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>(when (= *file* (<span style="color:#a6e22e">System/getProperty</span> <span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;babashka.file&#34;</span>)) <span style="color:#75715e">;; [3]</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>  )
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>The important pieces here are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Shebang<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> line to elevate this program into Babashka</li>
<li>The namespace declaration, ready to add any of Babashka&rsquo;s built-in libraries</li>
<li>The &ldquo;one little trick&rdquo; that allows this file to be loaded into a REPL without executing it.</li>
</ol>
<p>After opening this file up, I start a Babashka repl with <code>bb nrepl-server</code> in a tmux split and then I connect Conjure and evaluate the file. In a couple quick moves, I&rsquo;ve reached cruising altitude and am ready to fly through my code.</p>
<p>From here, it&rsquo;s normal Clojure development; creating small composable functions, combining them together to accomplish my task, rapidly iterating as I learn more about what I want to do.</p>
<p>For the most part, I rely on Babashka&rsquo;s <a href="https://book.babashka.org/#libraries">built-in namespaces</a>. In the rare times I need something else, I don&rsquo;t need to convert the script into a &ldquo;real&rdquo; project. Instead, I rely on one of two techniques.</p>
<p>The first is to use <code>babashka.deps</code>, like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-clojure" data-lang="clojure"><span style="display:flex;"><span>(<span style="color:#a6e22e">require</span> <span style="color:#f92672">&#39;</span>[babashka.deps <span style="color:#e6db74">:as</span> deps])
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>(<span style="color:#a6e22e">deps/add-deps</span> <span style="color:#f92672">&#39;</span>{<span style="color:#e6db74">:deps</span> {org.clj-commons/pretty {<span style="color:#e6db74">:mvn/version</span> <span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;2.2&#34;</span>}}})<span style="color:#f92672">&#39;</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>It&rsquo;s rather amazing that you can add any compatible library in-line like this. It&rsquo;s out of the realm of imagination in the old Bashiverse (or even Python, Ruby, or my old pal Perl).</p>
<p>The second way I&rsquo;ve reached out for other functionality is by including other Babashka scripts. This is one reason why I have a namespace declaration at the top (the other being that it&rsquo;s tidier).</p>
<p>For instance, I have a script called <a href="https://github.com/justone/dotfiles-personal/blob/personal/bin/bbts"><code>bbts</code></a> that will take incoming EDN data and look for any map key named timestamp and convert its value into a human readable date/time. This is super useful as my brain is not able to parse milliseconds directly.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-shell" data-lang="shell"><span style="display:flex;"><span>$ cat sample.edn
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#f92672">{</span>:mulog/timestamp 1697642960678<span style="color:#f92672">}</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#f92672">{</span>:mulog/data <span style="color:#f92672">{</span>:timestamp 1697642960678<span style="color:#f92672">}}</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>$ cat sample.edn | bbts
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#f92672">{</span>:mulog/timestamp <span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;2023-10-18 8:29:20.67 AM&#34;</span><span style="color:#f92672">}</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#f92672">{</span>:mulog/data <span style="color:#f92672">{</span>:timestamp <span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;2023-10-18 8:29:20.67 AM&#34;</span><span style="color:#f92672">}}</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Well, I recently was writing another script that had timestamp data and wanted to use <code>bbts</code>&rsquo;s <code>humanize-timestamps</code> function. So I added this snippet:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-clojure" data-lang="clojure"><span style="display:flex;"><span>(<span style="color:#a6e22e">require</span> <span style="color:#f92672">&#39;</span>[babashka.fs <span style="color:#e6db74">:as</span> fs])
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>(-&gt; <span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;bbts&#34;</span> fs/which fs/file load-file)
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>(<span style="color:#a6e22e">require</span> <span style="color:#f92672">&#39;</span>[bbts])
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>(<span style="color:#a6e22e">comment</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>  (<span style="color:#66d9ef">def </span>records ...)
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>  (map bbts/humanize-timestamps records))
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>I think a side-effect of using Clojure is that all of its design sensibilities kick in, and so even these small scripts end up reasonably well structured (at least after a while). This means that there are functions like this that are useful to other scripts.</p>
<p>I do think I will end up moving most of these functions into a library, but for ad-hoc sharing, this technique is pretty cool.</p>
<h1 id="larger-scripts">
  Larger scripts
  <a href="#larger-scripts" class="h-anchor" aria-hidden="true">#</a>
</h1>
<p>Sometimes, I want to write a larger script. One that has good <code>--help</code> documentation and tests to back up the implementation. My last post, about a <a href="/2023/08/07/highlight/">script that highlights text</a>, is one such example.</p>
<p>For this, I use an incubator called <a href="https://github.com/justone/bb-scripts">bb-scripts</a>. It&rsquo;s a Clojure project with some additional facilities for producing scripts that run in Babashka.</p>
<p>To make a new script, all I have to do is create <a href="https://github.com/justone/bb-scripts/blob/master/README.md#set-up">two files</a>, one for the script&rsquo;s main namespace and one to run it under Babashka. Then, after I&rsquo;m done (or done enough), I run an included script to create an uberscript so that the new script can stand on its own.</p>
<p>The advantages of using <code>bb-scripts</code> over the single file approach are:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Clojure nREPL implementation is slightly nicer in that it will pretty-print evaluation results.</li>
<li>Scripts can share common library code for things like argument parsing and string handling.</li>
<li>Tests are straightforward to specify and find, and can be run in both Babashka and Clojure.</li>
<li>Fiddle code can be kept outside of the main namespaces.</li>
</ul>
<p>It&rsquo;s nice to have the regular Clojure development experience and then end up with a quick-running script. See the repository&rsquo;s <a href="https://github.com/justone/bb-scripts/blob/master/README.md#development-workflow">README</a> for more information about using it for yourself.</p>
<h1 id="combining-power-with-ease-of-use">
  Combining power with ease of use
  <a href="#combining-power-with-ease-of-use" class="h-anchor" aria-hidden="true">#</a>
</h1>
<p>One thing I&rsquo;ve been experimenting with lately is using some of the <code>bb-scripts</code> libraries in my single-file scripts.
The reason I want to do this is that I want my scripts to be well behaved citizens of the terminal. Every script should respond to <code>--help</code> and exit with a non-zero code if the arguments are invalid.
With single-file scripts, this results in needing to implement the same boilerplate handling in each script. It&rsquo;s much easier in the <code>bb-scripts</code> incubator as there are shared namespaces to handle this.</p>
<p>So, to bring the shared namespaces over, I created the <a href="https://github.com/justone/bb-scripts/blob/master/src/lib/script/alpha.clj"><code>lib.script.alpha</code></a> namespace. It bundles together argument parsing and reporting into a single function.</p>
<p>For example, here&rsquo;s a very simple script to add two numbers. As you can see, almost half the script is devoted to command line argument handling.</p>

There is some boilerplate to pull in the additional dependency, but now the script can leverage the <code>simple-main</code> function with only a few lines are boilerplate.  The <code>simple-main</code> function takes options related to argument parsing and usage and returns the result of calling <code>clojure.tools.cli/parse-opts</code> only if there are no errors and <code>--help</code> was not passed. In addition to making sure the usage help is formatted properly for printing, the token <code>SCRIPT_NAME</code> is replaced with the actual script name so that examples are easier to show.</p>

<p>So that&rsquo;s how I write Babashka scripts. It&rsquo;s great to use the same language to write applications and extend my development and operations environment.</p>
<p>Oh, one last thing. I did a talk a couple years ago about using Babashka on the command line and I covered some of this same information. Check it out below.</p>
<p>Enjoy.</p>
