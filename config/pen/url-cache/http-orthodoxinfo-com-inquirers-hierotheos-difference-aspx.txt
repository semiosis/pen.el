<h1>The Difference Between Orthodox Spirituality and Other Traditions</h1>
<h2 class="author">by Metropolitan Hierotheos Vlachos</h2> 



<p>Orthodox spirituality differs distinctly 
  from any other "spirituality" of an eastern or western type. There can be no 
  confusion among the various spiritualities, because Orthodox spirituality is 
  God-centered, whereas all others are man-centered.</p>
<p>The difference appears primarily 
  in the doctrinal teaching. For this reason we put "Orthodox" before the word 
  "Church" so as to distinguish it from any other religion. Certainly "Orthodox" 
  must be linked with the term "Ecclesiastic," since Orthodoxy cannot exist outside 
  of the Church; neither, of course, can the Church exist outside Orthodoxy.</p>
<p>The dogmas are the results of decisions 
  made at the Ecumenical Councils on various matters of faith. Dogmas are referred 
  to as such, because they draw the boundaries between truth and error, between 
  sickness and health. Dogmas express the revealed truth. They formulate the life 
  of the Church. Thus they are, on the one hand, the expression of Revelation 
  and on the other act as "remedies" in order to lead us to communion with God; 
  to our reason for being.</p>
<p>Dogmatic differences reflect corresponding 
  differences in therapy. If a person does not follow the "right way" he cannot 
  ever reach his destination. If he does not take the proper "remedies," he cannot 
  ever acquire health; in other words, he will experience no therapeutic benefits. 
  Again, if we compare Orthodox spirituality with other Christian traditions, 
  the difference in approach and method of therapy is more evident.</p>
<p>A fundamental teaching of the Holy 
  Fathers is that the Church is a "Hospital" which cures the wounded man. In many 
  passages of Holy Scripture such language is used. One such passage is that of 
  the parable of the Good Samaritan: "But a certain Samaritan, as he journeyed, 
  came where he was. And when he saw him, he had compassion . So he went to him 
  and bandaged his wounds, pouring on oil and wine; and he set him on his own 
  animal, and brought him to an inn, and took care of him. On the next day, when 
  he departed, he took out two denarii, and gave them to the innkeeper, and said 
  to him, 'Take care of him; and whatever more you spend, when I come again, I 
  will repay you" (Luke 10:33-35).</p>
<p>In this parable, the Samaritan represents 
  Christ who cured the wounded man and led him to the Inn, that is to the "Hospital" 
  which is the Church. It is evident here that Christ is presented as the Healer, 
  the physician who cures man's maladies; and the Church as the true Hospital. 
  It is very characteristic that Saint John Chrysostom, analysing this parable, 
  presents these truths emphasised above.</p>
<p>Man's life "in Paradise" was reduced 
  to a life governed by the devil and his wiles. "And fell among thieves," that 
  is in the hands of the devil and of all the hostile powers. The wounds man suffered 
  are the various sins, as the prophet David says: "my wounds grow foul and fester 
  because of my foolishness" (Psalm 37). For "every sin causes a bruise and a 
  wound." The Samaritan is Christ Himself who descended to earth from Heaven in 
  order to cure the wounded man. He used oil and wine to "treat" the wounds; in 
  other words, by "mingling His blood with the Holy Spirit, he brought man to 
  life." According to another interpretation, oil corresponds to the comforting 
  word and wine to the harsh word. Mingled together they have the power to unify 
  the scattered mind. "He set him in His own beast," that is He assumed human 
  flesh on "the shoulders" of His divinity and ascended incarnate to His Father 
  in Heaven.</p>
<p>Then the Good Samaritan, i.e. Christ, 
  took man to the grand, wondrous and spacious inn - to the Church. And He handed 
  man over to the innkeeper, who is the Apostle Paul, and through the Apostle 
  Paul to all bishops and priests, saying: "Take care of the Gentile people, whom 
  I have handed over to you in the Church. They suffer illness wounded by sin, 
  so cure them, using as remedies the words of the Prophets and the teaching of 
  the Gospel; make them healthy through the admonitions and comforting word of 
  the Old and New Testaments." Thus, according to Saint Chrysostom, Paul is he 
  who maintains the Churches of God, "curing all people by his spiritual admonitions 
  and offering to each one of them what they really need."</p>
<p>In the interpretation of this parable 
  by Saint John Chrysostom, it is clearly shown that the Church is a Hospital 
  which cures people wounded by sin; and the bishops and priests are the therapists 
  of the people of God.</p>
<p>And this precisely is the work of 
  Orthodox theology. When referring to Orthodox theology, we do not simply mean 
  a history of theology. The latter is, of course, a part of this but not absolutely 
  or exclusively. In Patristic tradition, theologians are the God-seers. 
  Saint Gregory Palamas calls Barlaam [who attempted to bring Western scholastic 
  theology into the Orthodox Church] a "theologian," but he clearly emphasises 
  that intellectual theology differs greatly from the experience of the vision 
  of God. According to Saint Gregory Palamas theologians are the God-seers; those 
  who have followed the "method" of the Church and have attained to perfect faith, 
  to the illumination of the <em>nous</em> and to divinisation (<em>theosis</em>). 
  Theology is the fruit of man's cure and the path which leads to cure and the 
  acquisition of the knowledge of God.</p>

<p>Western theology, however, has differentiated 
  itself from Eastern Orthodox theology. Instead of being therapeutic, it is more 
  intellectual and emotional in character. In the West [after the Carolingian 
  "Renaissance"], scholastic theology evolved, which is antithetical to the Orthodox 
  Tradition. Western theology is based on rational thought whereas Orthodoxy is 
  hesychastic. Scholastic theology tried to understand logically the Revelation 
  of God and conform to philosophical methodology. Characteristic of such an approach 
  is the saying of Anselm [Archbishop of Canterbury from 1093-1109, one of the 
  first after the Norman Conquest and destruction of the Old English Orthodox 
  Church]: "I believe so as to understand." The Scholastics acknowledged God at 
  the outset and then endeavoured to prove His existence by logical arguments 
  and rational categories. In the Orthodox Church, as expressed by the Holy Fathers, 
  faith is God revealing Himself to man. We accept faith by hearing it not so 
  that we can understand it rationally, but so that we can cleanse our hearts, 
  attain to faith by theoria* and experience the Revelation of God.</p>
<p>Scholastic theology reached its 
  culminating point in the person of Thomas Aquinas, a saint in the Roman Catholic 
  Church. He claimed that Christian truths are divided into natural and supernatural. 
  Natural truths can be proven philosophically, like the truth of the Existence 
  of God. Supernatural truths - such as the Triune God, the incarnation of the 
  Logos, the resurrection of the bodies - cannot be proven philosophically, yet 
  they cannot be disproven. Scholasticism linked theology very closely with philosophy, 
  even more so with metaphysics. As a result, faith was altered and scholastic 
  theology itself fell into complete disrepute when the "idol" of the West - metaphysics 
  - collapsed. Scholasticism is held accountable for much of the tragic situation 
  created in the West with respect to faith and faith issues.</p>
<p>The Holy Fathers teach that natural 
  and metaphysical categories do not exist but speak rather of the created and 
  uncreated. Never did the Holy Fathers accept Aristotle's metaphysics. However, 
  it is not my intent to expound further on this. Theologians of the West during 
  the Middle Ages considered scholastic theology to be a further development of 
  the teaching of the Holy Fathers, and from this point on, there begins the teaching 
  of the Franks that scholastic theology is superior to that of the Holy Fathers. 
  Consequently, Scholastics, who are occupied with reason, consider themselves 
  superior to the Holy Fathers of the Church. They also believe that human knowledge, 
  an offspring of reason, is loftier than Revelation and experience.</p>
<p>It is within this context that the 
  conflict between Saint Gregory Palamas and Barlaam should be viewed. Barlaam 
  was essentially a scholastic theologian who attempted to pass on scholastic 
  theology to the Orthodox East.</p>
<p>Barlaam's views - that we cannot 
  really know Who the Holy Spirit is exactly (an outgrowth of which is agnosticism), 
  that the ancient Greek philosophers are superior to the Prophets and the Apostles 
  (since reason is above the vision of the Apostles), that the light of the Transfiguration 
  is something which is created and can be undone, that the hesychastic way of 
  life (i.e. the purification of the heart and the unceasing noetic prayer) is 
  not essential - are views which express a scholastic and, subsequently, a secularised 
  point of view of theology. Saint Gregory Palamas foresaw the danger that these 
  views held for Orthodoxy and through the power and energy of the Most Holy Spirit 
  and the experience which he himself had acquired as a successor to the Holy 
  Fathers, he confronted this great danger and preserved unadulterated the Orthodox 
  Faith and Tradition.</p>
<p>Having given a framework to the 
  topic at hand, if Orthodox spirituality is examined in relationship to Roman 
  Catholicism and Protestantism, the differences are immediately discovered.</p>
<p>Protestants do not have a "therapeutic 
  treatment" tradition. They suppose that believing in God, intellectually, constitutes 
  salvation. Yet salvation is not a matter of intellectual acceptance of truth; 
  rather it is a person's transformation and divinisation by grace. This transformation 
  is effected by the analogous "treatment" of one's personality, as shall be seen 
  in the following chapters. In the Holy Scripture it appears that faith comes 
  by hearing the Word and by experiencing "theoria" (the vision of God). We accept 
  faith at first by hearing in order to be healed, and then we attain to faith 
  by theoria, which saves man. Protestants, because they believe that the acceptance 
  of the truths of faith, the theoretical acceptance of God's Revelation, i.e. 
  faith by hearing saves man, do not have a "therapeutic tradition." It could 
  be said that such a conception of salvation is very naive.</p>
<p>The Roman Catholics as well do not 
  have the perfection of the therapeutic tradition which the Orthodox Church has. 
  Their doctrine of the Filioque is a manifestation of the weakness in their theology 
  to grasp the relationship existing between the person and society. They confuse 
  the personal properties: the "unbegotten" of the Father, the "begotten" of the 
  Son, and the procession of the Holy Spirit. The Father is the cause of the "generation" 
  of the Son and the procession of the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>The Latins' weakness to comprehend 
  and failure to express the dogma of the Trinity shows the non-existence of empirical 
  theology. The three disciples of Christ (Peter, James and John) beheld the glory 
  of Christ on Mount Tabor; they heard at once the voice of the Father, "This 
  is My beloved Son," and saw the coming of the Holy Spirit in a cloud, for, the 
  cloud is the presence of the Holy Spirit, as Saint Gregory Palamas says. Thus 
  the disciples of Christ acquired the knowledge of the Triune God in theoria 
  (vision of God) and by revelation. It was revealed to them that God is one essence 
  in three hypostases.</p>
<p>This is what Saint Symeon the New 
  Theologian teaches. In his poems he proclaims over and over that, while beholding 
  the uncreated Light, the deified man acquires the Revelation of God the Trinity. 
  Being in "theoria" (vision of God), the saints do not confuse the hypostatic 
  attributes. The fact that the Latin tradition came to the point of confusing 
  these hypostatic attributes and teaching that the Holy Spirit proceeds from 
  the Son also, shows the non-existence of empirical theology for them. Latin 
  tradition speaks also of created grace, a fact which suggests that there is 
  no experience of the grace of God. For, when man obtains the experience of God, 
  then he comes to understand well that this grace is uncreated. Without this 
  experience there can be no genuine "therapeutic tradition."</p>
<p>And indeed we cannot find in all 
  of Latin tradition, the equivalent to Orthodoxy's therapeutic method. The <em>nous</em> 
  is not spoken of; neither is it distinguished from reason. The darkened nous 
  is not treated as a malady, nor the illumination of the nous as therapy. Many 
  greatly publicised Latin texts are sentimental and exhaust themselves in a barren 
  ethicology. In the Orthodox Church, on the contrary, there is a great tradition 
  concerning these issues, which shows that within it there exists the true therapeutic 
  method.</p>
<p>A faith is a true faith inasmuch 
  as it has therapeutic benefits. If it is able to cure, then it is a true faith. 
  If it does not cure, it is not a true faith. The same thing can be said about 
  medicine: a true scientist is the doctor who knows how to cure and his method 
  has therapeutic benefits, whereas a charlatan is unable to cure. The same holds 
  true where matters of the soul are concerned. The difference between Orthodoxy 
  and the Latin tradition, as well as the Protestant confessions, is apparent 
  primarily in the method of therapy. This difference is made manifest in the 
  doctrines of each denomination. Dogmas are not philosophy, neither is theology 
  the same as philoosphy.</p>
<p>Since Orthodox spirituality differs 
  distinctly from the "spiritualities" of other confessions, so much the more 
  does it differ from the "spirituality" of eastern religions, which do not believe 
  in the Theanthropic nature of Christ and the Holy Spirit. They are influenced 
  by the philosophical dialectic, which has been surpassed by the Revelation of 
  God. These traditions are unaware of the notion of personhood and thus the hypostatic 
  principle. And love, as a fundamental teaching, is totally absent. One may find, 
  of course, in these eastern religions an effort on the part of their followers 
  to divest themselves of images and rational thoughts, but this is in fact a 
  movement towards nothingness, to non-existence. There is no path leading their 
  "disciples" to theosis-divinisation (see the note below) of the whole 
  man.</p>
<p>This is why a vast and chaotic gap 
  exists between Orthodox spirituality and the eastern religions, in spite of 
  certain external similarities in terminology. For example, eastern religions 
  may employ terms like ecstasy, dispassion, illumination, noetic energy, etc. 
  but they are impregnated with a content different from corresponding terms in 
  Orthodox spirituality.</p>

<div class="endnotes">
<h1>Endnotes</h1>

<p>* Theoria is the vision of the glory of God. Theoria is identified with the vision of 
  the uncreated Light, the uncreated energy of God, with the union of man with 
  God, with man's <em>theosis</em> (see note below). Thus, theoria, vision and theosis 
  are closely connected. Theoria has various degrees. There is illumination, vision 
  of God, and constant vision (for hours, days, weeks, even months). Noetic prayer 
  is the first stage of theoria. Theoretical man is one who is at this stage. 
  In Patristic theology, the theoretical man is characterised as the shepherd 
  of the sheep.</p>
<p>Theosis-Divinisation is the participation in the Uncreated grace of God. Theosis is identified and connected 
  with the theoria (vision) of the Uncreated Light (see note above). It is called 
  theosis in grace because it is attained through the energy, of the divine grace. 
  It is a co-operation of God with man, since God is He Who operates and man is 
  he who co-operates.</p></div>
