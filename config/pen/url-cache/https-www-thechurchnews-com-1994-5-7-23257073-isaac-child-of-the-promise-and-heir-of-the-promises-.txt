class="cn-article-body mt-4"><p class="c-paragraph">In his epistle to the Galatians, Paul correctly designates Isaac as  the child &quot;of promise.&quot; (Gal. 4:28.) There are two reasons why this  designation is appropriate. An understanding of them is helpful to us.</p><p class="c-paragraph">First, it was through Isaac that the promise to Abraham that the Lord would &quot;make thy seed as the dust of the earth&quot; (Gen. 13:15), or as numerous as the stars (Gen. 15:5; 22:17), or &quot;as the sand which is upon the sea shore&quot; (Gen. 22:17) would be fulfilled. (Gen. 21:9-14.) Indeed, the promises made to  Abraham, which result in the blessings of the &quot;Abrahamic Covenant,&quot; were  renewed with Isaac (Gen. 26:1-4, 24) and then later with his son Jacob. (See  Gen. 28; 35:9-13; 48:3-4, and Bruce R. McConkie, Mormon Doctrine, p. 13.) It  is certainly apparent that the Lord intended His covenant to be established  with Isaac even before Isaac was born. (Gen. 17:16, 19, 21.)Second, Paul suggested that Isaac&#39;s birth was the fulfillment of a promise  made between Abraham and the Lord. (Gal. 4:22-23.) Since Abraham was 100 years old and Sarah was 90 (Gen. 17:17), neither expected to become parents. Before  the announcement of Isaac&#39;s birth was made, we must assume Abraham and Sarah  expected the promise would be fulfilled through Ishmael, (Isaac&#39;s elder half  brother) born to Hagar, Sarah&#39;s handmaid. (Gen. 16.) The Lord even seems to  have set the exact time when Isaac would be born (Gen. 17:21; 18:14; 21:2),  and revealed the name by which he would be called in mortality. (Gen. 17:19;  21:3.) Thus Isaac became the first (and only) son of the first wife, making it culturally and traditionally appropriate for him to receive the promise made  to his father.</p><p class="c-paragraph">Circumstances of Isaac&#39;s birth</p><p class="c-paragraph">The news that Abraham and Sarah would become parents to a son was made to  them by the Lord Himself at the same time that He instructed Abraham: &quot;As for Sarai thy wife, thou shalt not call her name Sarai, but Sarah shall her name  be.&quot; (Gen. 17:5.) Sarah - meaning Princess - seems to be a fitting name of a  woman for whom a large number of offspring would be holders of the royal  priesthood. (D&amp;C 84:34.)</p><p class="c-paragraph">The scriptures tell us that this announcement caused both Abraham and Sarah to laugh. Both the original Hebrew and Joseph Smith corrected the word  &quot;laughter&quot; to a new and more appropriate word, &quot;rejoiced.&quot; (See Gen. 17:17 footnotes, and JST Gen. 17:23.) This seems a more appropriate emotion for a  childless couple learning they would soon have a son and heir. The great  message to all of us from the miraculous birth of Isaac is found in Gen.  18:14: &quot;Is anything too hard for the Lord?&quot;</p><p class="c-paragraph">The sacrifice of Isaac as a type of Christ</p><p class="c-paragraph">The Book of Mormon Prophet Jacob tells us that the command received by  Abraham to sacrifice his son Isaac was &quot;a similitude of God and his Only  Begotten Son.&quot; (Jacob 4:5.) To most readers of the Old Testament the  similarities between the test of Abraham and the sacrifice of Jesus Christ by  Heavenly Father are obvious, but many miss the precise detail. This recorded  biblical experience is also used by the Lord to help instruct the children of  Israel, both ancient and modern about the future role and sacrifice of His  only Son. The following are only some of the possible types and similitudes:</p><p class="c-paragraph">In the sacrifice of Isaac, Abraham was a type of Heavenly Father. His  previous name Abram means &quot;exalted father&quot; and Abraham means &quot;father of a  multitude.&quot; (See Bible Dictionary, &quot;Abraham,&quot; also Gen. 17:5.) Both names  are appropriate descriptions of our Heavenly Father.</p><p class="c-paragraph">Isaac was a type of Jesus Christ, the Only Begotten Son of God. He also  was the only son of Abraham and Sarah, and was called Abraham&#39;s &quot;only  begotten son&quot; by Paul as he recounted the faith of Abraham. (Heb. 11:17.) One of the meanings of the name Isaac is &quot;he rejoiceth,&quot; echoing the response of his parents to the announcement of his birth. Also, I have no doubt that the  Savior rejoiced that He was able to bring about the atonement to give everyone the opportunity to return to the presence of God. Such was His love for us  all.</p><p class="c-paragraph">The birth of Isaac to Sarah was a miraculous one, as was that of Jesus  Christ to Mary. Although not as unique as the Savior&#39;s birth, since others had given birth whilst seemingly barren and of old age, both needed the Lord&#39;s  power and intervention.</p><p class="c-paragraph">The place Abraham was to sacrifice Isaac was specified by the Lord: &#96;. . . get thee into the land of Moriah; upon one of the mountains which I will  tell thee of.&quot; The site where traditionally Abraham offered Isaac is now the  site of the Dome of the Rock, a beautiful Muslim mosque. Only a short distance away on a higher point of the same hill (Mount Moriah), is Calvary (Hebrew  name, Golgotha). Thus Abraham was commanded to sacrifice Isaac on the same  Mount that the Father would make the sacrifice of His Son, and where Jesus  would perform His ultimate sacrifice for the blessing of all mankind.</p><p class="c-paragraph">John 19:17 states that Jesus &quot;bearing his cross went forth into a place called the place of a skull, which is called in the Hebrew Golgotha.&quot; When  they got to Mount Moriah, Abraham left his servants and donkeys and continued  on foot. He &quot;took the wood of the burnt offering and laid it upon his</p><p class="c-paragraph">Isaac&#39;sT back.&quot; (JST Gen. 22:7.) Some have seen similarities between the  actions of the two sons in this event, both carrying the means of their own  sacrifice.</p><p class="c-paragraph">Insufficient direct detail of Isaac&#39;s age at the time of this event is  available in the Old Testament. However, it is relatively easy to calculate  that Isaac was 37 years old at Sarah&#39;s death. Even if the journey to Mount  Moriah took place several years before her death, Isaac would have been in his thirties, as was the Savior at the time of His crucifixion.</p><p class="c-paragraph">Isaac submitted voluntarily, just as the Savior would do. Since Abraham  was 100 when Isaac was born, it is easy to see that Isaac could easily  overpower him if he desired. &quot;The Bible mentions no struggle or objection.  Isaac&#39;s silence can only be explained in terms of his trust and obedience to  his father.&quot; (Dallin H. Oaks, October 1992 general conference; November 1992  Ensign, p. 37.) The prophet Isaiah writing about the Savior&#39;s submission to  the will of His Father writes: &quot; . . . as sheep before her shearers is dumb,  so he openeth not his mouth.&quot; (Isa. 53:7.)</p><p class="c-paragraph">We learn from John 8:56 and Helaman 8:17-18 that Abraham saw the  Savior&#39;s day and rejoiced to do so. We also learn from Abraham 3 and 4 that he was shown the creation of this earth, pre-mortal life, the choosing of a  Redeemer and the Lord&#39;s plan for this earth and its inhabitants. With all this information available to him through vision and the Urim and Thummim,  Abraham&#39;s answer to a question asked by Isaac is revealing. Realizing they  were carrying everything they needed to make a burnt offering to the Lord,  except the offering itself, Isaac asked his father, &quot; . . . but where is the  lamb for a burnt offering?&quot; (Gen. 22:7.) Abraham&#39;s reply was: &quot;My son, God  will provide himself a lamb. . . .&quot; (Gen. 22:8.) When the angel stopped  Abraham from slaying Isaac, &quot;he</p><p class="c-paragraph">AbrahamT lifted up his eyes and looked, and behold behind him a ram caught in  a thicket by his horns; and Abraham went and took the ram, and offered him up  for a burnt offering in the stead of his son.&quot; (Gen. 22:13.) A ram is not a  lamb, and the appearance and sacrifice of the ram was not the fulfillment of  the statement that &quot;God will provide himself a lamb.&quot; From previous  knowledge, Abraham knew that a lamb must be sacrificed, but it was to be  &quot;Christ the Lamb&quot; (D&amp;C 76:85), not a ram caught in a thicket. With this  understanding, it was possible for Abraham to teach his posterity, through  Isaac that sometime in the future &quot;the Lamb of God&quot; would come into the  world, and would be sacrificed. A further personal application of this event  was given in the October 1992 general conference by Elder Oaks: &quot;Because of  our sins and our mortality, we, like Isaac, are condemned to death. When all  other hope is gone our Father in Heaven provides the Lamb of God, and we are  saved by His sacrifice.&quot; (Ensign, Nov. 1992, p. 92.) Speaking of the  Crucifixion, Elder Neal A Maxwell stated: &quot;There was no ram in the thicket at Calvary to spare Him, this Friend of Abraham and Isaac.&quot; (October 1981  general conference, Ensign Nov. 1981, p. 8.)</p><p class="c-paragraph">Once the event was over and ended happily, Abraham named the place  &quot;Jehovah-Jireh&quot; meaning, &quot;In the mount of the Lord it shall be seen.&quot;  (Gen. 22:14.) However, Adam Clarke, citing other scholars, suggests the  correct translation should be &quot;on this mount the Lord shall be seen.&quot; Dr.  Clarke continued: &quot;From this it appears that the sacrifice offered by Abraham was understood to be a representative one, and a tradition was kept up that  Jehovah should be seen in a sacrificial way on his mount.&quot; (Bible Commentary  1:141, Clarke.)</p><p class="c-paragraph">One of the &quot;divine promises to Abraham was the assurance that Christ  would come through His lineage.&quot; (Mormon Doctrine, p. 13.) Thus Isaac was a  descendant of Abraham, and Christ was born through the lineage of both of  them. &quot;And so through Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, through David finally the  Lord became the Son of God through Abraham.&quot; (President Spencer W. Kimball,  October 1975 general conference; Ensign Nov. 1975, p. 80.)</p><p class="c-paragraph">Much of the commentary about the sacrifice of Isaac by Abraham focuses on  Abraham&#39;s faith, righteousness, obedience and courage. I feel we should also  spare a thought for Isaac, who also displayed complete obedience, total trust  in his prophet-father, and a willingness to submit to the will of his father  too, regardless of the possible pain and consequences. His reward for his  obedience has earned him, like his father, Abraham and son, Jacob, his  exaltation. They &quot;sit upon thrones, and are not angels but are gods.&quot; (D&amp;C  132:37.)</p><p class="c-paragraph">The marriage of Isaac</p><p class="c-paragraph">The Lord had selected an eternal partner for Isaac, who was from the land  of Abraham&#39;s origin and thus able to perpetuate the covenant the Lord made  with Abraham and Isaac. The person selected by the Lord had to be identified  by Abraham and introduced to Isaac. The story is recounted in Genesis 24, and  is a story of faith and commitment.</p><p class="c-paragraph">The servant of Abraham, who was sent to find Isaac a wife was promised by  Abraham, &quot;The Lord God of heaven . . . shall send his angel before thee, and  thou shalt take a wife unto my son from thence.&quot; (Gen. 24:7.) The Lord guided the servant to Rebekah, who &quot; . . . being a virgin, very fair to look upon,  such as the servant of Abraham had not seen, neither had any man known the  like unto her.&quot; (JST Gen. 24:16.) Such was her faith and trust in the Lord  she immediately accepted the invitation to leave her family, travel to a new  country completely foreign to her with Abraham&#39;s servant and his men, to marry a man she had never met. However, her family recognized the hand of the Lord  in this, saying to Abraham&#39;s servant: &quot;The thing proceedeth from the Lord: .  . . Behold, Rebekah is before thee, take her, and go, and let her be thy  master&#39;s son&#39;s wife, as the Lord hath spoken.&quot; (Gen. 24:50-51.) Thus her  simple response when given the choice was, &quot;I will go.&quot; (Gen. 24:58.) Before she left, Rebekah was given a blessing, which verifies the fact she was  foreordained to be Isaac&#39;s wife, and a partner with Isaac in the promise made  to him by the Lord. &quot;Thou art our sister, be thou the mother of thousands of  millions, and let thy seed possess the gates of those which hate them.&quot; (Gen. 24:60.) &quot;And Isaac brought her into his mother Sarah&#39;s tent, and took  Rebekah, and she became his wife; and he loved her.&quot; (Gen. 24:67, italics  added.)</p><p class="c-paragraph">Isaac&#39;s simple life</p><p class="c-paragraph">&quot;Isaac did not become an Abraham or a Jacob. He did not reach the heights  of Abraham, called the &#96;father of the faithful.&#39; Nor was he as impressive as  his son Israel, father of the twelve tribes. Yet Isaac is loved and revered.  He worshiped God, cared for his home, and pursued his work. He is remembered  simply as a man of peace. The eloquent simplicity of his life and his unique  ability to lend importance to the commonplace made him great.</p><p class="c-paragraph">&quot;Isaac worshiped at an altar of stone. He sought there answers to life&#39;s  questions: Where did I come from? Why am I here? Where am I going?</p><p class="c-paragraph">&quot;To know the word and works of God, Isaac knelt in his day at his altar.  His tent, a home for himself and family was sacred to him, as our homes are to us.</p><p class="c-paragraph">&quot;Kneeling at this altar, mindful of his family in his tent, Isaac found  most of his working hours consumed in watching over wells he had caused to be  digged. His flocks were nourished by them. His simple dependence upon the  water and the soil and the forage that grew is little different in our day,  for man must work.</p><p class="c-paragraph">&quot;How little things have changed since Isaac&#39;s day - the things that really matter. There is the same God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, the same family  roles to fill, the same need to work.&quot; (Elder A.

(Gen. 21:9-14.) Indeed, the promises made to  Abraham, which result in the blessings of the &quot;Abrahamic Covenant,&quot; were  renewed with Isaac (Gen. 26:1-4, 24) and then later with his son Jacob. (See  Gen. 28; 35:9-13; 48:3-4, and Bruce R. McConkie, Mormon Doctrine, p. 13.) It  is certainly apparent that the Lord intended His covenant to be established  with Isaac even before Isaac was born. (Gen. 17:16, 19, 21.)Second, Paul suggested that Isaac&#39;s birth was the fulfillment of a promise  made between Abraham and the Lord. (Gal. 4:22-23.) Since Abraham was 100 years old and Sarah was 90 (Gen. 17:17), neither expected to become parents. Before  the announcement of Isaac&#39;s birth was made, we must assume Abraham and Sarah  expected the promise would be fulfilled through Ishmael, (Isaac&#39;s elder half  brother) born to Hagar, Sarah&#39;s handmaid. (Gen. 16.) The Lord even seems to  have set the exact time when Isaac would be born (Gen. 17:21; 18:14; 21:2),  and revealed the name by which he would be called in mortality. (Gen. 17:19;  21:3.) Thus Isaac became the first (and only) son of the first wife, making it culturally and traditionally appropriate for him to receive the promise made  to his father.","type":"text"},{"_id":"W3TSVQ2X6RZ7V3MVDXRLIQ4NHA","additional_properties":{"dropcap":false,"endmark":false},"content":"Circumstances of Isaac&#39;s birth","type":"text"},{"_id":"W3TSVQ2X6RZ7V3MVDXRLIQ4NHA","additional_properties":{"dropcap":false,"endmark":false},"content":"The news that Abraham and Sarah would become parents to a son was made to  them by the Lord Himself at the same time that He instructed Abraham: &quot;As for Sarai thy wife, thou shalt not call her name Sarai, but Sarah shall her name  be.&quot; (Gen. 17:5.)

This seems a more appropriate emotion for a  childless couple learning they would soon have a son and heir.

With this  understanding, it was possible for Abraham to teach his posterity, through  Isaac that sometime in the future &quot;the Lamb of God&quot; would come into the  world, and would be sacrificed. A further personal application of this event  was given in the October 1992 general conference by Elder Oaks: &quot;Because of  our sins and our mortality, we, like Isaac, are condemned to death. When all  other hope is gone our Father in Heaven provides the Lamb of God, and we are  saved by His sacrifice.&quot; (Ensign, Nov. 1992, p. 92.) Speaking of the  Crucifixion, Elder Neal A Maxwell stated: &quot;There was no ram in the thicket at Calvary to spare Him, this Friend of Abraham and Isaac.&quot; (October 1981  general conference, Ensign Nov. 1981, p. 8.)","type":"text"},{"_id":"W3TSVQ2X6RZ7V3MVDXRLIQ4NHA","additional_properties":{"dropcap":false,"endmark":false},"content":"Once the event was over and ended happily, Abraham named the place  &quot;Jehovah-Jireh&quot; meaning, &quot;In the mount of the Lord it shall be seen.&quot;  (Gen. 22:14.)

Such was her faith and trust in the Lord  she immediately accepted the invitation to leave her family, travel to a new  country completely foreign to her with Abraham&#39;s servant and his men, to marry a man she had never met.

Behold, Rebekah is before thee, take her, and go, and let her be thy  master&#39;s son&#39;s wife, as the Lord hath spoken.&quot; (Gen. 24:50-51.) Thus her  simple response when given the choice was, &quot;I will go.&quot; (Gen. 24:58.) Before she left, Rebekah was given a blessing, which verifies the fact she was  foreordained to be Isaac&#39;s wife, and a partner with Isaac in the promise made  to him by the Lord. &quot;Thou art our sister, be thou the mother of thousands of  millions, and let thy seed possess the gates of those which hate them.&quot; (Gen. 24:60.) &quot;And Isaac brought her into his mother Sarah&#39;s tent, and took  Rebekah, and she became his wife; and he loved her.&quot; (Gen. 24:67, italics  added.)","type":"text"},{"_id":"W3TSVQ2X6RZ7V3MVDXRLIQ4NHA","additional_properties":{"dropcap":false,"endmark":false},"content":"Isaac&#39;s simple life","type":"text"},{"_id":"W3TSVQ2X6RZ7V3MVDXRLIQ4NHA","additional_properties":{"dropcap":false,"endmark":false},"content":"&quot;Isaac did not become an Abraham or a Jacob.
