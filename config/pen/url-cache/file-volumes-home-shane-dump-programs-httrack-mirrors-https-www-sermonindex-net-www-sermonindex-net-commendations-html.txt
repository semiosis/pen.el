I personally find it good from the vantage point of study and encouragement. We must, however, be aware of the human tendency to idolize the past to the point where we so judge the present body of Christ that we lose our own fruitfulness and hope for the future. 'Say not thou, What is the cause that the former days were better than these? for thou dost not inquire wisely concerning this.' (Ecclesiastes 7:10).'</i><br>

Sermon Index is such a source. It’s a no nonsense, uncompromised location of some of the most powerful messages from some of the most humble of men. My father David Wilkerson is one, my friend Lenard Ravenhill another. And from those still in the land of the living, Carter Conlon, Tim Delina, John Piper and many more. Sermon Index is a full plate of a rich spread of good and Godly content. 'Thy words were found and I ate them.' (Jer 15:16)'</i><br>

What a gift from God to this generation is SermonIndex! In an age of extreme superficiality and shallowness -- much of it driven by the Internet -- it is only fitting that the Internet hosts a deep, penetrating website like this. May the fire go forth from here and touch multiplied millions!'</i><br>

SermonIndex is a rare gem in the field of growing global web access for the people of God; the dedicated and sacrificial provision of often priceless treasures in ministry. For the last decade, both from many different generations and multiple streams of His wisdom, righteousness and glory, SermonIndex has been one of most useful modern gifts to the church in its opportunity to trace and freely share again what God has granted His servants.'</i><br>

It is important that we remember we stand on the shoulders of giants. Hearing these voices reminds me, 'If it's new, it's not true.' These Biblically based messages allow us to check ourselves.

I have lived my Christian life with an incredible hunger for more of the Lord. This deep desire is satisfied by seeking Jesus in prayer, personal Bible study, and by gleaning the deeper truths of God from those who preach His Word without compromise. I hunt down great teachings from those who have 'fought to the finish' and others who are still fighting with unquenchable commitment. When I saw the sermons of David Wilkerson and Leonard Ravenhill as part of the menu, the Lord immediately spoke to me of the treasure that was available. These men were my spiritual fathers for many years. Their delivery of the Word of God, both privately and publicly, was penetrating and life-changing. Log on and hear for yourself.'</i><br>
