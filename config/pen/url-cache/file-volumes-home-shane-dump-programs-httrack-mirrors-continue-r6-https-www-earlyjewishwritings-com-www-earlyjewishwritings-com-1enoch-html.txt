<h2>Information on 1 Enoch</h2>
<p>Emil Sch&uuml;rer writes: &quot;<i>Enoch</i> (in common with Elijah) occupies 
  this singular position among the Old Testament men of God, that when removed 
  from the earth he was carried directly to heaven. A man of this stamp could 
  not but appear peculiarly well fitted to serve as a medium through which to 
  communicate to the world revelations regarding the divine mysteries, seeing 
  that he had even been deemed worthy of immediate intercourse with God. Accordingly 
  at a somewhat early period, probably as far back as the second century before 
  Christ, an apocalyptic writing appeared purporting to have been composed by 
  Enoch, which work was subsequently issued in an enlarged and revised form. This 
  Book of Enoch was already known to the author of the Book of 'Jubilees' and 
  of the 'Testaments of the Twelve Patriarchs,' and was afterwards a great favourite 
  in the Christian Church. As is well known, it is quoted in the Epistle of Jude 
  (14, 15), while many of the Fathers use it without hesitation as the genuine 
  production of Enoch, and as containing authentic divine revelations, although 
  it has never been officially recognized by the Church as canonical. We still 
  find the Byzantine chronicler, George Syncellus (about 800 A.D.), quoting two 
  long passages from it (Syncell. <i>Chron</i>. ed. Dindorf, i. 20-23 and 42-47). 
  But after that the book disappeared, and was looked upon as lost till, in the 
  course of the last century, the discovery was made that an <i>Ethiopic version 
  of it was still extant</i> in the Abyssinian Church. In the year 1773, Bruce 
  the English traveller brought three manuscripts of it to Europe. But it was 
  not till the year 1821 that the whole work was given to the world through the 
  English translation of Laurence. A German translation was issued by Hoffmann 
  which, from chap. i. to lv. (1833), was based upon the English version of Laurence, 
  and from chap. lvi. to the end (1838) on the Ethiopic version collated with 
  a new manuscript. The Ethiopic text was published first by Laurence in 1838, 
  and subsequently by Dillmann in 1851, after having collated it with five manuscripts. 
  Dillmann likewise issued (1853) a new German translation, in which there were 
  material emendations, and on which all disquisitions connected with this book 
  have been based ever since. It seemed as though there were reason to hope that 
  more light would be thrown upon this book when a small fragment of it in Greek 
  (extending from ver. 42 to ver. 49 of chap. lxxxix.), taken from a <i>Codex 
  Vaticanus </i>(<i>cod. gr.</i> 1809), written in tachygraphic characters, was 
  published in facsimile by Mai (<i>Patrum Nova Biblioth</i>. vol. ii), and deciphered 
  by Gildmeister (<i>Zeitschr. der DMG. </i>1855, pp. 621-624). For, from what 
  was stated by Mai, one was led to suppose that there was still far more in the 
  codex than had yet been published. But, alas! a fresh examination by Gebhardt 
  revealed the fact that the deciphered fragment was all of the Book of Enoch 
  that it contained (Merx <i>Archiv</i>, vol. ii p. 243).&quot; (<i>The Literature 
  of the Jewish People in the Time of Jesus</i>, pp. 55-56)</p>
<p>James Charlesworth writes: &quot;This pseudepigraph has evoked divergent opinions; 
  but today there is a consensus that the book is a composite, portions of which 
  are clearly pre-Christian as demonstrated by the discovery of Aramaic and Hebrew 
  fragments from four of the five sections of the book among the Dead Sea Scrolls. 
  One of these fragments, moreover, Hen<font size="2"><sup>a</sup></font>, was 
  copied in the second half of the second century B.C. The main question concerns 
  the date of the second section, chapters 37-71, which contains the Son of Man 
  sayings. J. T. Milik (esp. no. 755) has shown that this section, which is not 
  represented among the early fragments, is probably a later addition to 1 Enoch; 
  but his contention that it was composed around A.D. 270 (no. 755, p. 377) is 
  very speculative. If, as most specialists concur, the early portions of 1 Enoch 
  date from the first half of the second century B.C., chapters 37-71 could have 
  been added in the first century B.C. or first century A.D. The original language 
  of 1 Enoch appears to be Aramaic, except for the Noah traditions, which were 
  probably composed in Hebrew. The earliest portions display impressive parallels 
  with the nascent thoughts of the Jewish sect which eventually settled at Qumran.&quot; 
  (<i>The Pseudepigrapha and Modern Research</i>, p. 98)</p>
<p>Raymond F. Surburg writes (<i>Introduction to the Intertestamental Period</i>, 
  pp. 142-143):</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p>The book was arranged by its last editor in five sections, as in the Psalms 
    and other Jewish Books.</p>
  <p>Section I (1-36) is mainly concerned with pronouncing God's judgment by Enoch 
    on the angels, or watchers who fell through their love for the daughters of 
    men (Gen. 6:1-4), and Enoch's intercession for them. A weird description of 
    Hades is found in this portion of 1 Enoch.</p>
  <p>Section II (37-71) has three &quot;parables,&quot; or apocalyptic revelations, 
    together with the story of Enoch's translation into heaven.</p>
  <p>Section III (72-87) is primarily concerned with furnishing a treatise on 
    astronomy, the secrets of the movement of the stars as revealed to Enoch, 
    who sees with his own eyes their very course, even the portals through which 
    they enter and issue forth, for the purpose of transmitting the information 
    to future generations.</p>
  <p>Section IV runs along lines laid down in the first two portions dealing with 
    the problem of sin and suffering of Israel. Enoch relates to Methuselah his 
    visions of the deluge, the fall of the angels, and their punishment in the 
    underworld, the deliverance of Noah, the Exodus, the giving of the Law, the 
    conquest of Canaan, the time of the judges, the establishment of the united 
    kingdom, the building of the temple, the story of the two kingdoms, the fall 
    of the Northern Kingdom, and the Exile. This is followed by four periods of 
    angelic rule up to the time of the Maccabean Revolt, the last assault of the 
    Gentiles, and the great Judgment. The last part of Section IV contains the 
    prediction of the foundation of the new Jerusalem, the conversion of the Gentiles, 
    the resurrection of the righteous, and the coming of the Messiah.</p>
  <p>Section V is without any account of the origin of sin but seems to be mainly 
    devoted to the problem of suffering of the righteous and the prosperity of 
    the oppressing sinners. It denounces evil and utters woes on sinners and promises 
    blessings to the righteous. Within Section V is an older work &quot;The Apocalypse 
    of Weeks&quot; (93:1-10; 91:12-19). It concludes (105): &quot;In those days 
    the Lord bade to summon and testify to the children of the earth concerning 
    their wisdom: show (it) unto them; for ye are their guides, and a recompense 
    over the world. For I and My Son will be united with them forever in the paths 
    of uprightness and in their lives; and ye shall have peace; rejoice, ye children 
    of uprightness. Amen.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Michael A. Knibb writes: &quot;The pentateuchal (five-part) structure outlined 
  above refers to the book in its present (Ethiopic) form; the Qumran discoveries 
  have made it clear that these traditions originally had a different shape. Fragments 
  of eleven manuscripts of Enoch in Aramaic were discovered amongst the Qumran 
  scrolls, and these fragments confirmed the view that 1 Enoch was composed in 
  Aramaic. The manuscripts fall into two distinct groups. On the one hand, fragments 
  from seven manuscripts correspond to parts of the first, fourth and fifth sections 
  of the Ethiopic book (chapters 1-36; 83-90; 91-107). The indications are that 
  these parts of 1 Enoch, together with a work known as the book of Giants, circulated 
  at Qumran as separate writings and were also copied out in combination&#151;with 
  the book of Giants apparently as the second of the four elements&#151;to form 
  a four-part corpus of Enochic writings, a tetrateuch. On the other hand, the 
  fragments from the other four manuscripts belong to a book of Astronomy which 
  at Qumran circulated separately from the other Enochic writings; the third section 
  of the Ethiopic book (chapters 72-82) is based on the Qumran book of Astronomy, 
  but is much shorter and differs quite substantially. No fragments were discovered 
  corresponding to the second section of the Ethiopic book (chapters 37-71), the 
  Parables.&quot; (<i>Outside the Old Testament</i>, p. 27)</p>
<p>James C. VanderKam writes of 1 Enoch 72-82: &quot;The Astronomical Book (AB) 
  was written in the Aramaic language, as we now know from the four copies of 
  it found among the Dead Sea Scrolls (4Q208-11). From Aramaic it was translated 
  into Greek (there are only a few small remnants that have survived) and from 
  Greek into Ethiopic. Judging from the script, the oldest of the Aramaic copies 
  (4Q208) dates from a time not far from 200 BCE; consequently, the book itself 
  was composed no later than that and probably earlier, although we do not know 
  how much earlier. The Aramaic copies that have survived indicate that the Ethiopic 
  version of the booklet, the only complete one that exists, is a condensed form 
  of the AB in that its text lacks some of the long, table-like sections attested 
  for the beginning of the book in two of the Aramaic copies.&quot; (<i>An Introduction 
  to Early Judaism</i>, p. 89)</p>
<p>Leonhard Rost writes: &quot;Chapters 72-82 constitute an astronomical treatise 
  probably written around the end of the second century B.C. Chapters 94-105 contain 
  exhortations of Enoch in the style of the farewell discourses of the twelve 
  patriarchs. These discourses date from the first century B.C. The beginning 
  of the book (chapters 1-5) and the conclusion (chapter 108) are among the redactional 
  additions to this complex book. They date from the first century B.C. Nothing 
  in the book makes any allusion to the coming of the Romans in 63 B.C.&quot; 
  (<i>Judaism Outside the Hebrew Canon</i>, p. 139)</p>
<p>Martin McNamara writes: &quot;This astronomical work is presupposed by <i>Jubilees</i> 
  4:17, 21 which may have been composed about the mid-second century B.C. This 
  would indicate a date of composition for <i>The Astronomical Book</i> in the 
  first quarter of the second century at the latest. J. T. Milik thinks it is 
  alluded to by the Hellenistic Jewish historian Eupolemus in a work completed 
  158 B.C. The <i>Book of Jubilees</i>, however, may have been composed later 
  in the second century B.C., but this need not affect the date to be assigned 
  to Enoch 72-82. Four copies of an Aramaic Astronomical work attributed to Enoch 
  have been found at Qumran, the earliest in Milik's opinion dating from the late 
  third or the beginning of the second century B.C., the latest from the first 
  years of teh first century A.D. These Qumran manuscripts have a longer text 
  than the Ethiopic, especially the section on calendrical reckoning. Milik believes 
  that the original Aramaic text is older than Gen 5:23, which presupposes it 
  and that it was connected with the calendrical reckoning of a highly theoretical 
  nature in the Persian period, but was later introduced by the Essenes into their 
  liturgical lfie. Milik also thinks that archaic features of the literary and 
  scientific content of the <i>Astronomical Book of Enoch</i> link it with ancient 
  Babylonian (and indeed Sumerian) literature, and that the description of the 
  terrestrial orb in Enoch 77 leads us, with complete certainty, to the Mesopotamian 
  centres of scholarship.&quot; (<i>Intertestamental Literature</i>, pp. 60-61)</p>
<p>James C. VanderKam writes of 1 Enoch 1-36: &quot;The second early booklet connected 
  with the name Enoch was also written in Aramaic. It too has been identified 
  in several copies from Qumran cave 4 (4Q201-202, 204-206), the oldest of which 
  (4Q201) dates from between 200 and 150 BCE. As a result, it may be another third-century 
  text. The Book of the Watchers (BW) is best known for introducing the strange 
  story (or stories) about the angels who sinned by marrying women and fathering 
  giants. The story in various forms became a major theme in the Enoch tradition 
  and in a surprisingly large number of other works both Jewish and Christian.&quot; 
  (<i>An Introduction to Early Judaism</i>, p. 91)</p>
<p>Martin McNamara writes of the Book of the Watchers: &quot;This section of 1 
  Enoch is itself a composite work. It begins with a Parable of Enoch on the lot 
  of the wicked and of the righteous (1-5). Next comes <i>The Book of the Watchers</i> 
  (i.e. the Angels) proper. This recounts the sin of the angels through their 
  sexual union with earthly women, on which follows the demoralization of humankind. 
  We are then told of the doom pronounced by God on the angels and of the joys 
  in store for the just (6-11), e.g., 'And . . . the Lord said to Raphael: &quot;Bind 
  Azazel by his hands and his feet, and throw him into the darkness . . . and 
  let him stay there for ever . . . that on the great day of judgment he may be 
  hurled into the fire&quot;' (10:4-6). 'Bind them for seventy generations under 
  the hills of the earth until the day of their judgment and of their consummation, 
  until the judgment which is for all eternity is accomplished. And in those days 
  they will lead them to the abyss of fire; in torment and in prison they will 
  be shut up for all eternity' (10:12-13).&quot; (<i>Intertestamental Literature</i>, 
  p. 55)</p>
<p>Leonhard Rost writes: &quot;Chapters 12-16 provide more details about Enoch's 
  role of mediator in the punishment of the fallen angels. Since they constitute 
  an expansion and correction of the corresponding material from the Book of Noah, 
  they must have come later, but they probably still date from the first half 
  of he second century B.C. Chapters 17-19 and 20-36 contain the first and second 
  journeys of Enoch through the various regions of the earth, the heavens, and 
  the underworld, with special emphasis on the dwelling places of the blessed 
  and the places where sinners and fallen angels are punished. These chapters 
  probably belong to the second century B.C. also.&quot; (<i>Judaism Outside the 
  Hebrew Canon</i>, p. 138)</p>
<p>Martin McNamara writes: &quot;In the words of J. T. Milik, the Qumran evidence 
  indicates 'that from the first half of the second century B.C. onwards the Book 
  of Watchers had essentially the same form as that in which it is known through 
  the Greek and Ethiopic versions.' It can be presumed that it circulated in this 
  form already by 200 B.C. Certain sections of it can be presumed to be older 
  still, e.g., the section on the fall of the angels (chs. 6-11, or even 6-19). 
  G. W. Nickelsburg believes that chapters 6-11 date from the fourth century, 
  while J. T. Milik (somewhat improbably) is of the opinion that 6-19 are older 
  than Genesis 6, which he believes is dependent on them.&quot; (<i>Intertestamental 
  Literature</i>, pp. 58-59)</p>
<p>Michael A. Knibb writes: &quot;The book of Watchers is, with the exception 
  of the book of Astronomy, the oldest part of 1 Enoch and the basis upon which 
  the other sections have been built; there are allusions to it and echoes of 
  it in the Parables, the book of Dreams and the Epistle. It is not all of one 
  piece, but acquired its present form by a process of accretion. After an introductory 
  section (chapters 1-5) the nucleus is formed by the story of the fall from heaven 
  of the Watchers, i.e. angels (chapters 6-16; cp. Dan. 4:13, 17, 23). To this 
  has been appended an account of Enoch's journey to the edge of the world where 
  he sees the places of punishment of the fallen angels and the disobedient stars, 
  as well as the range of seven mountains in the north-west, on the middle one 
  of which is situated the throne of God (chapters 17-19). Chapter 20, a list 
  of the seven archangels and their functions, forms the introduction to the account 
  of a second journey (chapters 21-36). In the first part of this journey Enoch 
  visits places already described in chapters 17-19, and thus chapters 21-5 may 
  be regarded as another version of the earlier journey in which the material 
  has been reordered and expanded. Thereafter Enoch goes to Jerusalem (chapters 
  26-27), and then far away to the east to the Garden of Righteousness (chapters 
  28-32). In the last part of the journey Enoch circles the earth and observes 
  certain astronomical and meteorological phenomena (chapters 33-6); this material 
  is related to the material in the book of Astronomy. For the accounts of these 
  two journeys the author made use of a wide range of biblical and extrabiblical 
  traditions. In particular he drew together in chapters 21-32 a number of different 
  biblical traditions relating to the mountain of God (cp. Ps. 48:2; Isa. 14:12-15; 
  Ezek. 28:11-19; Exod. 24:10) and to the garden of Eden with its tree of knowledge 
  and tree of life (Gen. 2-3). The underlying theme, announced already in the 
  introduction (chapters 1-5), is that of judgment. The places which Enoch is 
  above all concerned to describe are the mountain on which God will sit when 
  he visits the earth as judge, the place where the dead will wait until the day 
  of judgement, and the places where the wicked (both angels and men) and the 
  righteous will either be punished or enjoy a life of bliss.&quot; (<i>Outside 
  the Old Testament</i>, pp. 29-30)</p>
<p>James C. VanderKam writes of 1 Enoch 93:1-10 and 91:11-17: &quot;The oldest 
  surviving historical apocalypse in Jewish literature is probably the short composition 
  known as the Apocalypse of Weeks. The fact that it does not mention the persecution 
  of Jews and the ban on Judaism by Antiochus IV in 167 BCE implies that it was 
  written before these events, that is, perhaps in approximately 170 BCE. It has 
  accidentally been divided into two parts in the Ethiopian version of <i>1 Enoch</i> 
  and the order of the two parts reversed; an Aramaic manuscript from Qumran preserves 
  much of the apocalypse and has the parts in the correct order (4Q212). The apocalypse 
  takes the form of Enoch's report to Methuselah regarding a vision he had seen; 
  the text also mentions words of the angels and the contents of the heavenly 
  tablets as the sources of the revelation disclosed to him. In the report he 
  quickly sketches history from beginning to end, with almost all of it packaged 
  as a prediction. History and the different stages of the judgment are divided 
  into ten units called 'weeks.' These seven-part units are suggestive for several 
  reasons: they are one of a number of references and allusions to 'sevens' in 
  the apocalypse (e.g., Enoch is the seventh patriarch); the ten 'weeks' total 
  seventy units, itself a highly significant number in light of Jeremiah's prediction 
  that Jerusalem would be desolate for the seventy years of Babylonian control 
  (see Jer. 25:11-12; 29:10; Dan. 9:2, 24-27); and the decisive 'week,' that is, 
  the one in which the actual author lives and when the great turning point in 
  history will begin is the seventh. As 7 x 7 = 49, the total brings to mind associations 
  with the biblical jubilee (which the author of <i>Jubilees</i> and others understood 
  as a forty-nine-year unit).&quot; (<i>An Introduction to Early Judaism</i>, 
  pp. 103-104)</p>
<p>Leonhard Rost writes: &quot;The Apocalypse of Ten Weeks in chapters 93 and 
  91:12-17 is at least as early as the Book of Noah [second century B.C.?] and 
  possibly even earlier. It may originally have been limited to seven weeks and 
  later expanded. J. P. Thronton has suggested that it is a secret history of 
  the Qumran sect. If so, the conclusion, at least, would be somewhat later. The 
  commonly accepted view, however, finds no mention of the Maccabean period; rather, 
  it concludes that the number of apostates imply that only a certain righteous 
  individuals are elected to enjoy the age of salvation that follows directly. 
  This theory would date the Apocalypse of Ten Weeks prior to the Maccabean period, 
  in other words around 170 B.C. The Apocalypse of the Animals (85-90) contains 
  an account of history from Adam to the Hasmoneans and concludes with a vision 
  of the messianic age. The figures belonging to the primal history, like the 
  figure of the Messiah, are symbolized by bulls; the figures of the patriarchs 
  and their descendants down to the Hasmonean period are represented by sheep; 
  their opponents are symbolized by wolves and other wild beasts. The section 
  is the second earliest. Depending on whether it concludes with Judas Maccabeus 
  or ends with John Hyrcanus or even Alexander Jannaeus, it belongs to the middle 
  or end of the second century, or to the first quarter of the first century B.C.&quot; 
  (<i>Judaism Outside the Hebrew Canon</i>, pp. 137-138)</p>
<p>James C. VanderKam writes of 1 Enoch 83-90, the Book of Dreams: &quot;Here 
  too Enoch tells his son Methuselah about his predictive dream visions. In this 
  section he reports two such experiences. In the first and shorter one (83-84) 
  he sees the heavens thrown down on earth, the earth swallowed up, and everything 
  sinking into the abyss. His grandfather Mahalalel explains to him that the vision 
  concerns the wickedness of the earth and its approaching destruction (the flood). 
  He urges Enoch to pray that a remnant be left to him on the earth. He does pray 
  for the remnant, and, after seeing the sun rise on a new day, blesses and praises 
  the Lord. The second and longer section is called the Animal Apocalypse (chaps. 
  85-90). Interpretation of the last historical allusions in teh vision, especially 
  the character who appears to be Judas Maccabeus (the ram with a horn in 90:9, 
  etc.), has led scholars to date it to the late 160s BCE. The apocalypse has 
  received its name from the fact that in it biblical characters are described 
  symbolically as animals. Colors and types of animals express character evaluations. 
  In the text Enoch surveys all of scriptural history and moves beyond it to the 
  time of the actual author and the end. The symbols and the language are usually 
  clear enough so that the biblically literate reader can follow the course of 
  the story.&quot; (<i>An Introduction to Early Judaism</i>, p. 105)</p>
<p>Martin McNamara writes: &quot;In the <i>Book of Jubilees</i> 4:19 mention is 
  made of Enoch's dream visions of the course of history, by which the second 
  vision of this section may be intended. No fragment of the first vision (83-84) 
  has been found in Qumran. The second vision seems to have been composed in Maccabean 
  times, and possibly before Jonathan's assumption of the high priesthood in 153 
  B.C. The author seems to have belonged to the Hasidic movement.&quot; (<i>Intertestamental 
  Literature</i>, p. 62)</p>
<p>James C. VanderKam writes of 1 Enoch 37-71: &quot;Tucked between the two oldest 
  parts of <i>1 Enoch</i> is an apocalypse that goes under the name the <i>Similitudes</i> 
  or <i>Parables of Enoch</i>. In it Enoch receives a series of revelations that 
  are called <i>parables</i>; the first is in chaps. 38-44, the second in 45-47, 
  and the third in 58-69. Around these three units the author/editor has placed 
  introductory and concluding chapters (38 and 70-71). The focus in the <i>Similitudes</i> 
  is on the eschatological punishment of sinners and the blessing of the righteous; 
  a strong element of reversal is also involved. The downtrodden righteous do 
  not realize that their salvation is already prepared, while the oppressive sinners 
  at present fail to understand what awaits them. The text discloses that at the 
  end the rightous will enjoy bliss while the mighty sinners will be punished 
  and destroyed. In this work Enoch is termed a 'son of man,' and he is deeply 
  involved in the final judgment of the wicked and reward of the righteous.&quot; 
  (<i>An Introduction to Early Judaism</i>, p. 110)</p>
<p>Leonhard Rost writes: &quot;Chapters 37-71, following an introduction in chapter 
  37, comprise three discourses made up of similitudes or parables (38-44; 45-47; 
  and 58-69), together with appendices and supplements, into which the fragments 
  of the Book of Noah mentioned above have been incorporated. The similitudes 
  furnish information about the hierarchy of the angels and reveal atmospheric, 
  meteorological, and astronomical secrets; they culminate in the appointment 
  of Enoch as the Son of Man. They contain various traditions dating from earlier 
  ages but in their present recension cannot be designated earlier than the first 
  century B.C. J.T. Milik dates them as late as the second century C.E., above 
  all because there is no trace of them at Qumran.&quot; (<i>Judaism Outside the 
  Hebrew Canon</i>, pp. 138-139)</p>
<p>Martin McNamara writes: &quot;No fragment of any part of <i>Parables</i> has 
  been found in Qumran. For this, and for other reasons besides, some scholars 
  doubt its pre-Christian and Jewish character. J. T. Milik maintains that it 
  was composed in the second or third century of our era. However, contemporary 
  scholarship tends to reckon the parables Jewish, and to assign their composition 
  to the first century of the Christian era.&quot; (<i>Intertestamental Literature</i>, 
  p. 71)</p>
<p>Michael A. Knibb writes: &quot;The concern with the Son of Man has led to the 
  Parables being considered in relation to the traditions in the gospels about 
  the Son of Man. Some scholars have thought that the Parables are Christian, 
  but this is very unlikely because the Parables lack any reference to the life, 
  death and resurrection of Jesus; here the difference from the Testaments of 
  the Twelve Patriarchs, a work Jewish in origin but clearly Christian in its 
  present form, is particularly significant. In fact the Parables are a Jewish 
  work and are rooted firmly in traditions stemming from the Old Testament; they 
  build upon what is said about the 'one like a man' of Dan. 7, but also draw 
  upon traditions relating to the Davidic Messiah (cp. Isa. 11) and to God's servant 
  (cp. Isa. 49). It is a matter of debate whether the Parables, a Jewish work, 
  might have exercised some limited influence on the gospel traditions; but their 
  real importance&#151;in the writer's opinion from towards the end of that century. 
  It should be noted that for this section of Enoch we have available only an 
  Ethiopic text.&quot; (<i>Outside the Old Testament</i>, p. 44)</p>
<p>James C. VanderKam writes of 1 Enoch 91-107: &quot;The fifth and last booklet 
  in <i>1 Enoch</i> is called the Epistle of Enoch. It is the literary home of 
  the Apocalypse of Weeks (93:1-10; 91:11-17) and of several other types of literary 
  units. As a result of this variety it is difficult to classify chapters 91-107 
  under any single rubric, but they do share several features with the wisdom 
  tradition and thus can be studied here. The Epistle may date to roughly the 
  same time as the Apocalypse of Weeks, that is, not far from 170 BCE. At least 
  there is no convincing reason for putting it at a later time. Parts of the Epistle, 
  like most other booklets in <i>1 Enoch</i>, have been preserved in the Aramaic 
  fragments from Qumran cave 4.&quot; (<i>An Introduction to Early Judaism</i>, 
  pp. 119-120)</p>
<p>Martin McNamara writes: &quot;Material of a variety of kinds follows on <i>The 
  Apocalypse of Weeks</i>: Enoch's admonitions to the righteous (94:1-5) and woes 
  on sinners (94:6-11; 95); reasons why the righteous should have hope (96:1-3), 
  and why sinners should fear (96:4-8). There are woes on those who acquire unrighteous 
  gain (97), and once more on sinners in general (98-104). The central motif of 
  this section is the economic differentiation between rich and poor, the classes 
  being practically identified with the sinners and righteous respectively. The 
  rich are accused of idolatry in certain texts (99:6-9; cf. 91:9 and 104:9). 
  The rich sinners are presented as oppressing the righteous poor (95:7; 96:5, 
  8; 103:9-15; 104:3). The statement that sin originated with man ('Sin has not 
  been sent upon the earth, but man himself has created it', 98:4) may be intended 
  to stress human responsibility but may also be directed against other sections 
  of the Enochic corpus which present the Watchers as having introduced it at 
  the Flood (e.g. 1 Enoch 6-11).&quot; (<i>Intertestamental Literature</i>, p. 
  67) </p>
