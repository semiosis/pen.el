<p>THE EPISTLE OF BARNABAS<br>
Translated by J.B. Lightfoot. </p>

<p>Barnabas 1:1<br>
I Bid you greeting, sons and daughters, in the name of the Lord that<br>
loved us, in peace.</p>

<p>Barnabas 1:2<br>
 Seeing that the ordinances of God are great and rich unto you, I<br>
rejoice with an exceeding great and overflowing joy at your blessed<br>
and glorious spirits; so innate is the grace of the spiritual gift<br>
that ye have received.</p>

<p>Barnabas 1:3<br>
Wherefore also I the more congratulate myself hoping to be saved, for<br>
that I truly see the Spirit poured out among you from the riches of<br>
the fount of the Lord. So greatly did the much-desired sight of you<br>
astonish me respecting you.</p>

<p>Barnabas 1:4<br>
Being therefore persuaded of this, and being conscious with myself<br>
that having said much among you I know that the Lord journeyed with<br>
me on the way of righteousness, and am wholly constrained also myself<br>
to this, to love you more than my own soul (for great faith and love<br>
dwelleth in you through the hope of the life which is<br>
His)--considering this therefore, that,</p>

<p>Barnabas 1:5<br>
if it shall be my care to communicate to you some portion of that<br>
which I received, it shall turn to my reward for having ministered to<br>
such spirits, I was eager to send you a trifle, that along with your<br>
faith ye might have your knowledge also perfect.</p>

<p>Barnabas 1:6<br>
Well then, there are three ordinances of the Lord; *the hope of life,<br>
which is the beginning and end of our faith; and righteousness, which<br>
is the beginning and end of judgment; love shown in gladness and<br>
exultation, the testimony of works of righteousness.*</p>

<p>Barnabas 1:7<br>
For the Lord made known to us by His prophets things past and<br>
present, giving us likewise the firstfruits of the taste of things<br>
future. And seeing each of these things severally coming to pass,<br>
according as He spake, we ought to offer a richer and higher offering<br>
to the fear of Him. But I, not as though I were a teacher, but as<br>
one of yourselves, will show forth a few things, whereby ye shall be<br>
gladdened in the present circumstances.</p>

<p>Barnabas 2:1<br>
 Seeing then that the days are evil, and that the Active One himself<br>
has the authority, we ought to give heed to ourselves and to seek out<br>
the ordinances of the Lord.</p>

<p>Barnabas 2:2<br>
The aids of our faith then are fear and patience, and our allies are<br>
long-suffering and self-restraint.</p>

<p>Barnabas 2:3<br>
While these abide in a pure spirit in matters relating to the Lord,<br>
wisdom, understanding, science, knowledge rejoice with them.</p>

<p>Barnabas 2:4<br>
For He hath made manifest to us by all the prophets that He wanteth<br>
neither sacrifices nor whole burnt offerings nor oblations, saying at<br>
one time;</p>

<p>Barnabas 2:5<br>
<I>What to Me is the multitude of your sacrifices, saith the Lord I am<br>
full of whole burnt-offerings, and the fat of lambs and the blood<br>
of bulls and of goats desire not, not though ye should come to be<br>
seen of Me. or who required these things at your hands? Ye shall<br>
continue no more to tread My court. If ye bring fine flour, it is<br>
in vain; incense is an abomination to Me; your new moons and your<br>
Sabbaths I cannot away with.</I></p>

<p>Barnabas 2:6<br>
These things therefore He annulled, that the new law of our Lord<br>
Jesus Christ, being free from the yoke of constraint, might have its<br>
oblation not made by human hands.</p>

<p>Barnabas 2:7<br>
And He saith again unto them; <I>Did command your fathers when they<br>
went forth from the land of Egypt to bring Me whole burnt offerings<br>
and sacrifices?</I></p>

<p>Barnabas 2:8<br>
<I>Nay, this was My command unto them, Let none of you bear a grudge<br>
of evil against his neighbor in his heart, and love you not a false<br>
oath.</I></p>

<p>Barnabas 2:9<br>
So we ought to perceive, unless we are without understanding, the<br>
mind of the goodness of our Father; for He speaketh to us, desiring<br>
us not to go astray like them but to seek how we may approach Him.</p>

<p>Barnabas 2:10<br>
Thus then speaketh He to us; <I>The sacrifice unto God is a broken<br>
heart, the smell of a sweet savor unto the Lord is a heart that<br>
glorifies its Maker.</I> We ought therefore, brethren, to learn<br>
accurately concerning our salvation, lest the Evil One having<br>
effected an entrance of error in us should fling us away from our<br>
life.</p>

<p>Barnabas 3:1<br>
 He speaketh again therefore to them concerning these things;<br>
<I>Wherefore fast ye for Me, saith the Lord, so that your voice is<br>
heard this day crying aloud? This is not the fast which have chosen,<br>
saith the Lord; not a man abasing his soul;</I></p>

<p>Barnabas 3:2<br>
<I>not though ye should bend your neck as a hoop, and put on sackcloth<br>
and make your bed of ashes, not even so shall ye call a fast that is<br>
acceptable.</I></p>

<p>Barnabas 3:3<br>
But unto us He saith; <I>Behold, this is the fast which I have chosen,<br>
saith the Lord; loosen every band of wickedness, untie the<br>
tightened cords of forcible contracts, send away the broken ones<br>
released and tear in pieces every unjust bond. Break thy bread to<br>
the hungry, and if thou seest one naked clothe him; bring the<br>
shelterless into thy house, and if thou seest a humble man, thou<br>
shalt not despise him, neither shall any one of thy household and<br>
of thine own seed.</I></p>

<p>Barnabas 3:4<br>
<I>Then shall thy light break forth in the morning, and thy healing<br>
shall arise quickly, and righteousness shall go forth before thy<br>
face, and the glory of God shall environ thee.<br>
</I><br>
Barnabas 3:5<br>
<I>Then shalt thou cry out and God shall hear thee; while thou art<br>
still speaking, He shall say 'Lo, I am here'; if thou shalt take<br>
away from thee the yoke and the stretching forth of the finger and<br>
the word of murmuring, and shalt give thy bread to the hungry<br>
heartily, and shalt pity the abased soul.</I></p>

<p>Barnabas 3:6<br>
To this end therefore, my brethren, He that is long-suffering,<br>
foreseeing that the people whom He had prepared in His well-beloved<br>
would believe in simplicity, manifested to us beforehand concerning<br>
all things, that we might not as novices shipwreck ourselves upon<br>
their law.</p>

<p>Barnabas 4:1<br>
 It behooves us therefore to investigate deeply concerning the<br>
present, and to search out the things which have power to save us.<br>
Let us therefore flee altogether from all the works of lawlessness,<br>
lest the works of lawlessness overpower us; and let us loathe the<br>
error of the present time, that we may be loved for that which is to<br>
come.</p>

<p>Barnabas 4:2<br>
Let us give no relaxation to our soul that it should have liberty to<br>
consort with sinners and wicked men, lest haply we be made like unto<br>
them.</p>

<p>Barnabas 4:3<br>
The last offence is at hand, concerning which the scripture speaketh,<br>
as Enoch saith. <I>For to this end the Master hath cut the seasons and<br>
the days short, that His beloved might hasten and come to His<br>
inheritance.</I></p>

<p>Barnabas 4:4<br>
And the prophet also speaketh on this wise; <I>Ten reigns shall reign<br>
upon the earth, and after them shall arise another king, who shall<br>
bring low three of the kings under one.</I></p>

<p>Barnabas 4:5<br>
In like manner Daniel speaketh concerning the same; <I>And I saw the<br>
forth beast to be wicked and strong and more intractable than all<br>
the beasts of the earth, and how there arose from him ten horns,<br>
and from these a little horn and excrescence, and how that it<br>
abased under one three of the great horns.</I></p>

<p>Barnabas 4:6<br>
Ye ought therefore to understand. Moreover I ask you this one thing<br>
besides, as being one of yourselves and loving you all in particular<br>
more than my own soul, to give heed to yourselves now, and not to<br>
liken yourselves to certain persons who pile up sin upon sin, saying<br>
that our covenant remains to them also.</p>

<p>Barnabas 4:7<br>
Ours it is; but they lost it in this way for ever, when Moses had<br>
just received it. For the scripture saith; <I>And Moses was in the<br>
mountain fasting forty days and forty nights, and he received the<br>
covenant from the Lord, even tablets of stone written with the<br>
finger of the hand of the Lord.</I></p>

<p>Barnabas 4:8<br>
But they lost it by turning unto idols. For thus saith the Lord;<br>
<I>Moses, Moses, come down quickly; for thy people whom thou<br>
broughtest out of the land of Egypt hath done unlawfully.</I> And<br>
Moses understood, and threw the two tables from his hands; and their<br>
covenant was broken in pieces, that the covenant of the beloved Jesus<br>
might be sealed unto our hearts in the hope which springeth from<br>
faith in Him.</p>

<p>Barnabas 4:9<br>
But though I would fain write many things, not as a teacher, but as<br>
becometh one who loveth you not to fall short of that which we<br>
possess, I was anxious to write to you, being your devoted slave.<br>
Wherefore let us take heed in these last days. For the whole time of<br>
our faith shall profit us nothing, unless we now, in the season of<br>
lawlessness and in the offenses that shall be, as becometh sons of<br>
God, offer resistance, that the Black One may not effect an entrance.</p>

<p>Barnabas 4:10<br>
Let us flee from all vanity, let us entirely hate the works of the<br>
evil way. Do not entering in privily stand apart by yourselves, as<br>
if ye were already justified, but assemble yourselves together and<br>
consult concerning the common welfare.</p>

<p>Barnabas 4:11<br>
For the scripture saith; <I>Woe unto them that are wise for<br>
themselves, and understanding in their own sight.</I> Let us become<br>
spiritual, let us become a temple perfect unto God. As far as in us<br>
lies, let us exercise ourselves in the fear of God, [and] let us<br>
strive to keep His commandments, that we may rejoice in His<br>
ordinances.</p>

<p>Barnabas 4:12<br>
The Lord judgeth the world without respect of persons; each man shall<br>
receive according to his deeds. If he be good, his righteousness<br>
shall go before him in the way; if he be evil, the recompense of his<br>
evil-doing is before him; lest perchance,</p>

<p>Barnabas 4:13<br>
if we relax as men that are called, we should slumber over our sins,<br>
and the prince of evil receive power against us and thrust us out<br>
from the kingdom of the Lord.</p>

<p>Barnabas 4:14<br>
Moreover understand this also, my brothers. When ye see that after<br>
so many signs and wonders wrought in Israel, even then they were<br>
abandoned, let us give heed, lest haply we be found, as the scripture<br>
saith, <I>many are called but few are chosen.</I></p>

<p>Barnabas 5:1<br>
 For to this end the Lord endured to deliver His flesh unto<br>
corruption, that by the remission of sins we might be cleansed, which<br>
cleansing is through the blood of His sprinkling.</p>

<p>Barnabas 5:2<br>
For the scripture concerning Him containeth some things relating to<br>
Israel, and some things relating to us. And it speaketh thus; <I>He<br>
was wounded for your transgressions, and He hath been bruised for<br>
our sins; by His stripes we were healed. As a sheep He was led to<br>
slaughter, as a lamb is dumb before his shearer.</I></p>

<p>Barnabas 5:3<br>
We ought therefore to be very thankful unto the Lord, for that He<br>
both revealed unto us the past, and made us wise in the present, and<br>
as regards the future we are not without understanding.</p>

<p>Barnabas 5:4<br>
Now the scripture saith; <I>Not unjustly is the net spread for the<br>
birds.</I> He meaneth this that a man shall justly perish, who having<br>
the knowledge of the way of righteousness forceth himself into the<br>
way of darkness.</p>

<p>Barnabas 5:5<br>
There is yet this also, my brethren; if the Lord endured to suffer<br>
for our souls, though He was Lord of the whole world, unto whom God<br>
said from the foundation of the world, <I>Let us make man after our<br>
image and likeness</I>, how then did He endure to suffer at the hand<br>
of men?</p>

<p>Barnabas 5:6<br>
Understand ye. The prophets, receiving grace from Him, prophesied<br>
concerning Him. But He Himself endured that He might destroy death<br>
and show forth the resurrection of the dead, for that He must needs<br>
be manifested in the flesh;</p>

<p>Barnabas 5:7<br>
that at the same time He might redeem the promise made to the<br>
fathers, and by preparing the new people for Himself might show,<br>
while He was on earth, that having brought about the resurrection He<br>
will Himself exercise judgment.</p>

<p>Barnabas 5:8<br>
Yea and further, He preached teaching Israel and performing so many<br>
wonders and miracles, and He loved him exceedingly.</p>

<p>Barnabas 5:9<br>
And when He chose His own apostles who were to proclaim His Gospel,<br>
who that He might show that <I>He came not to call the righteous but<br>
sinners</I> were sinners above every sin, then He manifested Himself<br>
to be the Son of God.</p>

<p>Barnabas 5:10<br>
For if He had not come in the flesh neither would men have looked<br>
upon Him and been saved, forasmuch as when they look upon the sun<br>
that shall cease to be, which is the work of His own hands, they<br>
cannot face its rays.</p>

<p>Barnabas 5:11<br>
Therefore the Son of God came in the flesh to this end, that He might<br>
sum up the complete tale of their sins against those who persecuted<br>
and slew His prophets.</p>

<p>Barnabas 5:12<br>
To this end therefore He endured. For God saith of the wounds of His<br>
flesh that they came from them; <I>When they shall smite their own<br>
shepherd, then shall the sheep of the flock be lost.</I></p>

<p>Barnabas 5:13<br>
But He Himself desired so to suffer; for it was necessary for Him to<br>
suffer on a tree. For he that prophesied said concerning Him, <I>Spare<br>
My soul form the sword;</I> and, <I>Pierce My flesh with nails, for the<br>
congregations of evil-doers have risen up against Me.</I></p>

<p>Barnabas 5:14<br>
And again He saith; <I>Behold I have given My back to stripes, and My<br>
cheeks to smitings, and My face did I set as a hard rock.</I></p>

<p>Barnabas 6:1<br>
 When then He gave the commandment, what saith He? <I>Who is he that<br>
disputeth with Me? Let him oppose Me. Or who is he that goeth to<br>
law with Me? Let him draw nigh unto the servant of the Lord,</I></p>

<p>Barnabas 6:2<br>
<I>Woe unto you, for ye all shall wax old as a garment, and the moth<br>
shall consume you.</I> And again the prophet saith, seeing that as a<br>
hard stone He was ordained for crushing; <I>Behold I will put into the<br>
fountains of Zion a stone very precious, elect, a chief<br>
corner-stone, honorable.</I></p>

<p>Barnabas 6:3<br>
Then again what saith He; <I>And whosoever shall set his hope on Him,<br>
shall live forever.</I> Is our hope then set upon a stone? Far be it.<br>
But it is because the Lord hath set His flesh in strength. For He<br>
saith; <I>And He set Me as a hard rock.</I></p>

<p>Barnabas 6:4<br>
And the prophet saith again; <I>The stone which the builders rejected,<br>
this became the head and the corner.</I> And again He saith; <I>This is<br>
the great and wonderful day, which the Lord made.</I></p>

<p>Barnabas 6:5<br>
I write to you the more simply, that ye may understand, I who am the<br>
offscouring of your love.</p>

<p>Barnabas 6:6<br>
What then saith the prophet again? <I>The assembly of evildoers<br>
gathered around Me, they surrounded Me as bees surround a comb</I>;<br>
and; <I>For My garment they cast a lot.</I></p>

<p>Barnabas 6:7<br>
Forasmuch then as He was about to be manifested in the flesh and to<br>
suffer, His suffering was manifested beforehand. For the prophet<br>
saith concerning Israel; <I>Woe unto their soul, for they have<br>
counseled evil counsel against themselves saying, Let us bind the<br>
righteous one, for he is unprofitable for us.</I></p>

<p>Barnabas 6:8<br>
What sayeth the other prophet Moses unto them? <I>Behold, these things<br>
saith the Lord God; enter into the good land which the Lord swear<br>
unto Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and inherit it, a land flowing with<br>
milk and honey.</I></p>

<p>Barnabas 6:9<br>
But what saith knowledge? Understand ye. Set your hope on Him who<br>
is about to be manifested to you in the flesh, even Jesus. For man<br>
is earth suffering; for from the face of the earth came the creation<br>
of Adam.</p>

<p>Barnabas 6:10<br>
What then saith He? <I>Into the good land, a land flowing with milk<br>
and honey.</I> Blessed is our Lord, brethren, who established among us<br>
wisdom and understanding of His secret things. For the prophet<br>
speaketh a parable concerning the Lord. Who shall comprehend, save<br>
he that is wise and prudent and that loveth his Lord?</p>

<p>Barnabas 6:11<br>
Forasmuch then as He renewed us in the remission of sins, He made us<br>
to be a new type, so that we should have the soul of children, as if<br>
He were recreating us.</p>

<p>Barnabas 6:12<br>
For the scripture saith concerning us, how He saith to the Son; <I>Let<br>
us make man after our image and after our likeness, and let them<br>
rule over the beasts of the earth and the fowls of the heaven and<br>
the fishes of the sea.</I> And the Lord said when He saw the fair<br>
creation of us men; <I>Increase and multiply and fill the earth.</I><br>
These words refer to the Son.</p>

<p>Barnabas 6:13<br>
Again I will shew thee how the Lord speaketh concerning us. He made<br>
a second creation at the last; and the Lord saith; <I>Behold I make<br>
the last things as the first.</I> In reference to this then the<br>
prophet preached; <I>Enter into a land flowing with milk and honey,<br>
and be lords over it.</I></p>

<p>Barnabas 6:14<br>
Behold then we have been created anew, as He saith again in another<br>
prophet; <I>Behold, saith the Lord, I will take out from these</I>, that<br>
is to say, from those whom the Spirit of the Lord foresaw, <I>their<br>
stony hearts, and will put into them hearts of flesh;</I> for He<br>
Himself was to be manifested in the flesh and to dwell in us.</p>

<p>Barnabas 6:15<br>
For a holy temple unto the Lord, my brethren, is the abode of our<br>
heart.</p>

<p>Barnabas 6:16<br>
For the Lord saith again; <I>For wherein shall I appear unto the Lord<br>
my God and be glorified? I will make confession unto Thee in the<br>
assembly of my brethren, and I will sing unto Thee in the midst of<br>
the assembly of the saints.</I> We therefore are they whom He brought<br>
into the good land.</p>

<p>Barnabas 6:17<br>
What then is the milk and the honey Because the child is first kept<br>
alive by honey, and then by milk. So in like manner we also, being<br>
kept alive by our faith in the promise and by the word, shall live<br>
and be lords of the earth.</p>

<p>Barnabas 6:18<br>
Now we have already said above; <I>And let them increase and multiply<br>
and rule over the fishes.</I> But who is he that is able [now] to rule<br>
over beasts and fishes and fowls of the heaven; for we ought to<br>
perceive that to rule implieth power, so that one should give orders<br>
and have dominion.</p>

<p>Barnabas 6:19<br>
If then this cometh not to pass now, assuredly He spake to us for the<br>
hereafter, when we ourselves shall be made perfect so that we may<br>
become heirs of the covenant of the Lord.</p>

<p>Barnabas 7:1<br>
 Understand therefore, children of gladness, that the good Lord<br>
manifested all things to us beforehand, that we might know to whom we<br>
ought in all things to render thanksgiving and praise.</p>

<p>Barnabas 7:2<br>
If then the Son of God, being Lord and future Judge of quick and<br>
dead, suffered that His wound might give us life, let us believe that<br>
the Son of God could not suffer except for our sakes.</p>

<p>Barnabas 7:3<br>
But moreover when crucified He had vinegar and gall given Him to<br>
drink. Hear how on this matter the priests of the temple have<br>
revealed. Seeing that there is a commandment in scripture,<br>
<I>Whatsoever shall not observe the fast shall surely die,</I> the Lord<br>
commanded, because He was in His own person about to offer the vessel<br>
of His Spirit a sacrifice for our sins, that the type also which was<br>
given in Isaac who was offered upon the alter should be fulfilled.</p>

<p>Barnabas 7:4<br>
What then saith He in the prophet? <I>And let them eat of the goat<br>
that is offered at the fast for all their sins.</I> Attend carefully;<br>
<I>And let all the priests alone eat the entrails unwashed with<br>
vinegar.</I></p>

<p>Barnabas 7:5<br>
Wherefore? Since ye are to give Me, who am to offer My flesh for the<br>
sins of My new people, gall with vinegar to drink, eat ye alone,<br>
while the people fasteth and waileth in sackcloth and ashes; that He<br>
might shew that He must suffer at their hands.</I></p>

<p>Barnabas 7:6<br>
Attend ye to the commandments which He gave. <I>Take two goats, fair<br>
and alike, and offer them, and let the priest take the one for a<br>
whole burnt offering for sins.</I></p>

<p>Barnabas 7:7<br>
But the other one--what must they do with it? <I>Accursed,</I> saith He,<br>
<I>is the one.</I> Give heed how the type of Jesus is revealed.</p>

<p>Barnabas 7:8<br>
<I>And do ye all spit upon it and goad it, and place scarlet wool<br>
about its head, and so let it be cast into the wilderness.</I> And<br>
when it is so done, he that taketh the goat into the wilderness<br>
leadeth it, and taketh off the wool, and putteth it upon the branch<br>
which is called Rachia, the same whereof we are wont to eat the<br>
shoots when we find them in the country. Of this briar alone is the<br>
fruit thus sweet.</p>

<p>Barnabas 7:9<br>
What then meaneth this? Give heed. <I>The one at the alter, and the<br>
other accursed.</I> And moreover the accursed one crowned. For they<br>
shall see Him in that day wearing the long scarlet robe about His<br>
flesh, and shall say, Is not this He, Whom once we crucified and set<br>
at nought and spat upon; verily this was He, Who then said that He<br>
was the Son of God.</p>

<p>Barnabas 7:10<br>
For how is He like the goat? For this reason it says <I>the goats<br>
shall be fair and alike,</I> that, when they shall see Him coming<br>
then, they may be astonished at the likeness of the goat. Therefore<br>
behold the type of Jesus that was to suffer.</p>

<p>Barnabas 7:11<br>
But what meaneth it, that they place the wool in the midst of the<br>
thorns? It is a type of Jesus set forth for the Church, since<br>
whosoever should desire to take away the scarlet wool it behoved him<br>
to suffer many things owing to the terrible nature of the thorn, and<br>
through affliction to win the mastery over it. Thus, He saith, they<br>
that desire to see Me, and to attain unto My kingdom, must lay hold<br>
on Me through tribulation and affliction.</p>

<p>Barnabas 8:1<br>
 But what think ye meaneth the type, where the commandment is given<br>
to Israel that those men, whose sins are full grown, offer an heifer<br>
and slaughter and burn it, and then that the children take up the<br>
ashes, and cast them into vessels, and twist the scarlet wool on a<br>
tree (see here again is the type of the cross and the scarlet wool),<br>
and the hyssop, and that this done the children should sprinkle the<br>
people one by one, that they may be purified from their sins?</p>

<p>Barnabas 8:2<br>
Understand ye how in all plainness it is spoken unto you; the calf is<br>
Jesus, the men that offer it, being sinners, are they that offered<br>
Him for the slaughter. After this it is no more men (who offer); the<br>
glory is no more for sinners.</p>

<p>Barnabas 8:3<br>
The children who sprinkle are they that preached unto us the<br>
forgiveness of sins and the purification of our heart, they to whom,<br>
being twelve in number for a testimony unto the tribes (for there are<br>
twelve tribes of Israel), He gave authority over the Gospel, that<br>
they should preach it.</p>

<p>Barnabas 8:4<br>
But wherefore are the children that sprinkle three in number? For a<br>
testimony unto Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, because these are mighty<br>
before God.</p>

<p>Barnabas 8:5<br>
Then there is the placing the wool on the tree. This means that the<br>
kingdom of Jesus is on the cross, and that they who set their hope on<br>
Him shall live for ever.</p>

<p>Barnabas 8:6<br>
And why is there the wool and the hyssop at the same time? Because<br>
in His kingdom there shall be evil and foul days, in which we shall<br>
be saved; for he who suffers pain in the flesh is healed through the<br>
foulness of the hyssop.</p>

<p>Barnabas 8:7<br>
Now to us indeed it is manifest that these things so befell for this<br>
reason, but to them they were dark, because they heard not the voice<br>
of the Lord.</p>

<p>Barnabas 9:1<br>
 Furthermore He saith concerning the ears, how that it is our heart<br>
which He circumcised. The Lord saith in the prophet; <I>With the<br>
hearing of the ears they listened to Me.</I> And again He saith;<br>
They that are afar off shall hear with their ears, and shall<br>
perceive what I have done.</I> And; <I>Be ye circumcised in your<br>
hearts,</I> saith the Lord.</p>

<p>Barnabas 9:2<br>
And again He saith; <I>Hear, O Israel, for thus saith the Lord thy<br>
God. Who is he that desireth to live forever, let him hear with his<br>
ears the voice of My servant.</I><br>
 ~y<br>
And again He saith; <I>Hear, O heaven, and give ear, O earth, for the <br>
Lord hath spoken these things for a testimony.</I> And again He saith;<br>
Hear the words of the Lord, ye rulers of this people.</I> And again He<br>
saith; <I>Hear, O my children, the voice of one crying in the<br>
wilderness.</I> Therefore He circumcised our ears, that hearing the<br>
word we might believe.</p>

<p>Barnabas 9:3<br>
But moreover the circumcision, in which they have confidence, is<br>
abolished; for He hath said that a circumcision not of the flesh<br>
should be practiced. But they transgressed, for an evil angel taught<br>
them cleverness.</p>

<p>Barnabas 9:4<br>
He saith unto them; <I>Thus saith the Lord your God</I> (so I find the<br>
commandment); <I>sow not upon thorns, be ye circumcised in to your<br>
Lord.</I> And what saith He? <I>Be ye circumcised in the hardness of<br>
your heart; and then ye will not harden your neck.</I> Take this<br>
again; <I>Behold, sayith the Lord, all the Gentiles are uncircumcised<br>
in their foreskin, but this people is uncircumcised in their <br>
hearts.</I></p>

<p>Barnabas 9:5<br>
But thou wilt say; In truth the people hath been circumcised for a<br>
seal. Nay, but so likewise is every Syrian and Arabian and all the<br>
priests of the idols. Do all those then too belong to their<br>
covenant? Moreover the Egyptians also are included among the<br>
circumcised.</p>

<p>Barnabas 9:6<br>
Learn therefore, children of love, concerning all things abundantly,<br>
that Abraham, who first appointed circumcision, looked forward in the<br>
spirit unto Jesus, when he circumcised having received the ordinances<br>
of three letters.</p>

<p>Barnabas 9:7<br>
For the scripture saith; <I>And Abraham circumcised of his household<br>
eighteen males and three hundred.</I> What then was the knowledge<br>
given unto him? Understand ye that He saith <I>the eighteen</I> first,<br>
and then after an interval <I>three hundred</I> In the eighteen 'I'<br>
stands for ten, 'H' for eight. Here thou hast JESUS (IHSOYS). And<br>
because the cross in the 'T' was to have grace, He saith also <I>three<br>
hundred</I>. So He revealeth Jesus in the two letters, and in the<br>
remaining one the cross.</p>

<p>Barnabas 9:8<br>
He who placed within us the innate gift of His covenant knoweth; no<br>
man hath ever learnt from me a more genuine word; but I know that ye<br>
are worthy.</p>

<p>Barnabas 10:1<br>
 But forasmuch as Moses said; <I>Ye shall not eat seine nor eagle nor<br>
falcon nor crow nor any fish which hath no scale upon it</I>, he<br>
received in his understanding three ordinances.</p>

<p>Barnabas 10:2<br>
Yea and further He saith unto them in Deuteronomy; <I>And I will lay<br>
as a covenant upon this people My ordinances.</I> So then it is not a<br>
commandment of God that they should not bite with their teeth, but<br>
Moses spake it in spirit.</p>

<p>Barnabas 10:3<br>
Accordingly he mentioned the swine with this intent. Thou shalt not<br>
cleave, saith he, to such men who are like unto swine; that is, when<br>
they are in luxury they forget the Lord, but when they are in want<br>
they recognize the Lord, just as the swine when it eateth knoweth not<br>
his lord, but when it is hungry it crieth out, and when it has<br>
received food again it is silent.</p>

<p>Barnabas 10:4<br>
<I>Neither shalt thou eat eagle nor falcon nor kite nor crow. Thou<br>
shalt not, He saith, cleave unto, or be likened to, such men who now<br>
not how to provide food for themselves by toil and sweat, but in<br>
their lawlessness seize what belongeth to others, and as if they were<br>
walking in guilelessness watch and search about for some one to rob<br>
in their rapacity, just as these birds alone do not provide food for<br>
themselves, but sit idle and seek how they may eat the meat that<br>
belongeth to others, being pestilent in their evil-doings.</I></p>

<p>Barnabas 10:5<br>
<I>And thou shalt not eat,</I> saith He, <I>lamprey nor polypus nor cuttle<br>
fish</I> . Thou shalt not, He meaneth, become like unto such men, who<br>
are desperately wicked, and are already condemned to death, just as<br>
these fishes alone are accursed and swim in the depths, not swimming<br>
on the surface like the rest, but dwell on the ground beneath the<br>
deep sea.</p>

<p>Barnabas 10:6<br>
<I>Moreover thou shalt not eat the hare.</I> Why so? Thou shalt not be<br>
found a corrupter of boys, nor shalt thou become like such persons;<br>
for the hare gaineth one passage in the body every year; for<br>
according to the number of years it lives it has just so many<br>
orifices.</p>

<p>Barnabas 10:7<br>
Again, <I>neither shalt thou eat the hyena;</I> thou shalt not, saith He,<br>
become an adulterer or a fornicator, neither shalt thou resemble such<br>
persons. Why so? Because this animal changeth its nature year by<br>
year, and becometh at one time male and at another female.</p>

<p>Barnabas 10:8<br>
Moreover He hath hated the weasel also and with good reason. Thou<br>
shalt not, saith He, become such as those men of whom we hear as<br>
working iniquity with their mouth for uncleanness, neither shalt thou<br>
cleave unto impure women who work iniquity with their mouth. For<br>
this animal conceiveth with its mouth.</p>

<p>Barnabas 10:9<br>
Concerning meats then Moses received three decrees to this effect and<br>
uttered them in a spiritual sense; but they accepted them according<br>
to the lust of the flesh, as though they referred to eating.</p>

<p>Barnabas 10:10<br>
And David also receiveth knowledge of the same three decrees, and<br>
saith; <I>Blessed is the man who hath not gone in the council of the<br>
ungodly</I>--even as the fishes go in darkness into the depths; <I>and<br>
hath not stood in the path of sinners</I>--just as they who pretend to<br>
fear the Lord sin like swine; <I>and hath not sat on the seat of the<br>
destroyers</I>--as the birds that are seated for prey. Ye have now the<br>
complete lesson concerning eating.</p>

<p>Barnabas 10:11<br>
Again Moses saith; <I>Ye shall everything that divideth the hoof and<br>
cheweth the cud.</I> What meaneth he? He that receiveth the food<br>
knoweth Him that giveth him the food, and being refreshed appeareth<br>
to rejoice in him. Well said he, having regard to the commandment.<br>
What then meaneth he? Cleave unto those that fear the Lord, with<br>
those who meditate in their heart on the distinction of the word<br>
which they have received, with those who tell of the ordinances of<br>
the Lord and keep them, with those who know that meditation is a work<br>
of gladness and who chew the cud of the word of the Lord. But why<br>
that which divideth the hoof? Because the righteous man both walketh<br>
in this world, and at the same time looketh for the holy world to<br>
come. Ye see how wise a lawgiver Moses was.</p>

<p>Barnabas 10:12<br>
But whence should they perceive or understand these things? Howbeit<br>
we having justly perceived the commandments tell them as the Lord<br>
willed. To this end He circumcised our ears and hearts, that we<br>
might understand these things.</p>

<p>Barnabas 11:1<br>
 But let us enquire whether the Lord took care to signify before hand<br>
concerning the water and the cross. Now concerning the water it is<br>
written in reference to Israel, how that they would not receive the<br>
baptism which bringeth remission of sins, but would build for<br>
themselves.</p>

<p>Barnabas 11:2<br>
For the prophet saith; <I>Be astonished, O heaven, and let the earth<br>
shudder the more at this, for this people hath done two evil<br>
things; they abandoned Me the fountain of life, and they digged for<br>
themselves a pit of death.</I></p>

<p>Barnabas 11:3<br>
<I>Is My holy mountain of Sinai a desert rock? for ye shall be as the<br>
fledglings of a bird, which flutter aloft when deprived of their<br>
nest.</I></p>

<p>Barnabas 11:4<br>
And again the prophet saith; <I>I will go before thee, and level<br>
mountains and crush gates of brass and break in pieces bolts of<br>
iron, and I will give thee treasures dark, concealed, unseen, that<br>
they may know that I am the Lord God.</I></p>

<p>Barnabas 11:5<br>
And; <I>Thou shalt dwell in a lofty cave of a strong rock.</I> And; <I>His<br>
water shall be sure; ye shall see the King in glory, and your soul<br>
shall meditate on the fear of the Lord.</I></p>

<p>Barnabas 11:6<br>
And again He saith in another prophet; <I>And He that doeth these<br>
things shall be as the tree that is planted by the parting streams<br>
of waters, which shall yield his fruit at his proper season, and<br>
his leaf shall not fall off, and all things whatsoever he doeth<br>
shall prosper.</I></p>

<p>Barnabas 11:7<br>
<I>Not so are the ungodly, not so, but are as the dust which the wind<br>
scattereth from the face of the earth. Therefore ungodly men shall<br>
not stand in judgment, neither sinners in the council of the<br>
righteous; for the Lord knoweth the way of the righteous, and the<br>
way of the ungodly shall perish.</I></p>

<p>Barnabas 11:8<br>
Ye perceive how He pointed out the water and the cross at the same<br>
time. For this is the meaning; Blessed are they that set their hope<br>
on the cross, and go down into the water; for He speaketh of the<br>
reward at <I>his proper season</I>; then, saith He, I will repay. But now<br>
what saith He? <I>His leaves shall not fall off</I>; He meaneth by this<br>
that every word, which shall come forth from you through your mouth<br>
in faith and love, shall be for the conversion and hope of many.</p>

<p>Barnabas 11:9<br>
And again another prophet saith; <I>And the land of Jacob was praised<br>
above the whole earth.</I> He meaneth this; He glorifieth the vessel<br>
of His Spirit.</p>

<p>Barnabas 11:10<br>
Next what saith He? <I>And there was a river streaming from the right<br>
hand, and beautiful trees rose up from it; and whosoever shall eat<br>
of them shall live forever.</I></p>

<p>Barnabas 11:11<br>
This He saith, because we go down into the water laden with sins and<br>
filth, and rise up from it bearing fruit in the heart, resting our<br>
fear and hope on Jesus in the spirit. <I>And whosoever shall eat of<br>
these shall live forever</I>; He meaneth this; whosoever, saith He,<br>
shall hear these things spoken and shall believe, shall live forever.</p>

<p>Barnabas 12:1<br>
 In like manner again He defineth concerning the cross in another<br>
prophet, who saith; <I>And when shall these things be accomplished?<br>
saith the Lord. Whenever a tree shall be bended and stand upright,<br>
and whensoever blood shall drop from a tree.</I> Again thou art taught<br>
concerning the cross, and Him that was to be crucified.</p>

<p>Barnabas 12:2<br>
And He saith again in Moses, when war was waged against Israel by men<br>
of another nation, and that He might remind them when the war was<br>
waged against them that for their sins they were delivered unto<br>
death; the Spirit saith to the heart of Moses, that he should make a<br>
type of the cross and of Him that was to suffer, that unless, saith<br>
He, they shall set their hope on Him, war shall be waged against them<br>
for ever. Moses therefore pileth arms one upon another in the midst<br>
of the encounter, and standing on higher ground than any he stretched<br>
out his hands, and so Israel was again victorious. Then, whenever he<br>
lowered them, they were slain with the sword.</p>

<p>Barnabas 12:3<br>
Wherefore was this? That they might learn that they cannot be saved,<br>
unless they should set their hope on Him.</p>

<p>Barnabas 12:4<br>
And again in another prophet He saith; <I>The whole day long have I<br>
stretched out My hands to a disobedient people that did gainsay My<br>
righteous way.</I></p>

<p>Barnabas 12:5<br>
Again Moses maketh a type of Jesus, how that He must suffer, and that<br>
He Himself whom they shall think to have destroyed shall make alive<br>
in an emblem when Israel was falling. For the Lord caused all manner<br>
of serpents to bite them, and they died (forasmuch as the<br>
transgression was wrought in Eve through the serpent), that He might<br>
convince them that by reason of their transgression they should be<br>
delivered over to the affliction of death.</p>

<p>Barnabas 12:6<br>
Yea and further though Moses gave the commandment; <I>Ye shall not<br>
have a molten or a carved image for your God</I>, yet he himself made<br>
one that he might show them a type of Jesus. So Moses maketh a brazen<br>
serpent, and setteth it up conspicuously, and summoneth the people by<br>
proclamation.</p>

<p>Barnabas 12:7<br>
When therefore they were assembled together they entreated Moses that<br>
he should offer up intercession for them that they might be healed.<br>
And Moses said unto them; Whensoever, said he, one of you shall be<br>
bitten, let him come to the serpent which is placed on the tree, and<br>
let him believe and hope that the serpent being himself dead can make<br>
alive; and forthwith he shall be saved. And so they did. Here again<br>
thou hast in these things also the glory of Jesus, how that in Him<br>
and unto Him are all things.</p>

<p>Barnabas 12:8<br>
What again saith Moses unto Jesus (Joshua) the son of Nun, when he<br>
giveth him this name, as being a prophet, that all the people might<br>
give ear to him alone, because the Father revealeth all things<br>
concerning His Son Jesus?</p>

<p>Barnabas 12:9<br>
Moses therefore saith to Jesus the son of Nun, giving him this name,<br>
when he sent him as a spy on the land; <I>Take a book in thy hands,<br>
and write what the Lord saith, how the Son of God shall cut up by<br>
the roots all the house of Amalek in the last days.</I></p>

<p>Barnabas 12:10<br>
Behold again it is Jesus, not a son of man, but the Son of God, and<br>
He was revealed in the flesh in a figure. Since then men will say<br>
that Christ is the son of David, David himself prophesieth being<br>
afraid and understanding the error of sinners; <I>The Lord said unto<br>
my Lord, Sit thou on My right hand until I set thine enemies for a<br>
footstool under Thy feet.</I></p>

<p>Barnabas 12:11<br>
And again thus sayith Isaiah; <I>The Lord said unto my Christ the<br>
Lord, of whose right hand I laid hold, that the nations should give<br>
ear before Him, and I will break down the strength of kings.</I> See<br>
how David calleth Him Lord, and calleth Him not Son.</p>

<p>Barnabas 13:1<br>
 Now let us see whether this people or the first people hath the<br>
inheritance, and whether the covenant had reference to us or to them.</p>

<p>Barnabas 13:2<br>
Hear then what the scripture saith concerning the people; <I>And Isaac<br>
prayed concerning Rebecca his wife, for she was barren. And she<br>
conceived. Then Rebecca went out to enquire of the Lord. And the<br>
Lord said unto her; Two nations are in thy womb, and two peoples in<br>
thy belly, and one people shall vanquish another people, and the<br>
greater shall serve the less.</I></p>

<p>Barnabas 13:3<br>
Ye ought to understand who Isaac is, and who Rebecca is, and in whose<br>
case He hath shown that the one people is greater than the other.</p>

<p>Barnabas 13:4<br>
And in another prophecy Jacob speaketh more plainly to Joseph his<br>
son, saying; <I>Behold, the Lord hath not bereft me of thy face; bring<br>
me thy sons, that I may bless them.</I></p>

<p>Barnabas 13:5<br>
And he brought Ephraim and Manasseh, desiring that Manasseh should be<br>
blessed, because he was the elder; for Joseph led him by the right<br>
hand of his father Jacob. But Jacob saw in the spirit a type of the<br>
people that should come afterwards. And what saith He? <I>And Jacob<br>
crossed his hands, and placed his right hand on the head of<br>
Ephraim, the second and younger, and blessed him. And Joseph said<br>
unto Jacob, Transfer thy right hand to the head of Manasseh, for he<br>
is my first born son. And Jacob said to Joseph, I know it, my son,<br>
I know it; but the greater shall serve the less. Yet this one also<br>
shall be blessed.</I></p>

<p>Barnabas 13:6<br>
Mark in whose cases He ordained that this people should be first and<br>
heir of the covenant.</p>

<p>Barnabas 13:7<br>
If then besides this He also recorded it through Abraham, we attain<br>
the completion of our knowledge. What then saith he to Abraham when<br>
he alone believed, and was ascribed for righteousness? <I>Behold I<br>
have made thee, Abraham, a father of nations that believe in God in<br>
uncircumcision.</I></p>

<p>Barnabas 14:1<br>
 Yea verily, but as regards the covenant which He swear to the<br>
fathers to give it to the people let us see whether He hath actually<br>
given it. He hath given it, but they themselves were not found worthy<br>
to receive it by reason of their sins.</p>

<p>Barnabas 14:2<br>
For the prophet saith; <I>And Moses was fasting in Mount Sinai forty<br>
days and forty nights, that he might receive the covenant of the<br>
Lord to give to the people. And [Moses] received from the Lord the<br>
two tables which were written by the finger of the hand of the Lord<br>
in the spirit.</I> And Moses took them, and brought them down to give<br>
them to the people.</p>

<p>Barnabas 14:3<br>
And the Lord said unto Moses; <I>Moses, Moses, come down quickly; for<br>
thy people, whom thou leddest forth from the land of Egypt, hath<br>
done wickedly. And Moses perceived that they had made for<br>
themselves again molten images, and he cast them out of his hands<br>
and the tables of the covenant of the Lord were broken in pieces.</I></p>

<p>Barnabas 14:4<br>
Moses received them, but they themselves were not found worthy. But<br>
how did we receive them? Mark this. Moses received them being a<br>
servant, but the Lord himself gave them to us to be the people of His<br>
inheritance, having endured patiently for our sakes.</p>

<p>Barnabas 14:5<br>
But He was made manifest, in order that at the same time they might<br>
be perfected in their sins, and we might receive the covenant through<br>
Him who inherited it, even the Lord Jesus, who was prepared<br>
beforehand hereunto, that appearing in person He might redeem out of<br>
darkness our hearts which had already been paid over unto death and<br>
delivered up to the iniquity of error, and thus establish the<br>
covenant in us through the word.</p>

<p>Barnabas 14:6<br>
For it is written how the Father chargeth Him to deliver us from<br>
darkness, and to prepare a holy people for Himself.</p>

<p>Barnabas 14:7<br>
Therefore saith the prophet; <I>I the Lord thy God called thee in<br>
righteousness, and I will lay hold of thy hand and will strengthen<br>
thee, and I have given thee to be a covenant of the race, a light<br>
to the Gentiles, to open the eyes of the blind, and to bring forth<br>
them that are bound from their fetters, and them that sit in<br>
darkness from their prison house.</I> We perceive then whence we were<br>
ransomed.</p>

<p>Barnabas 14:8<br>
Again the prophet saith; <I>Behold I have set Thee to be a light unto<br>
the Gentiles, that Thou shouldest be for salvation unto the ends of<br>
the earth; thus saith the Lord that ransomed thee, even God.</I></p>

<p>Barnabas 14:9<br>
Again the prophet saith; <I>The Spirit of the Lord is upon Me,<br>
wherefore He anointed Me to preach good tidings to the humble; He<br>
hath sent Me to heal them that are broken-hearted, to preach<br>
release to the captives and recovery of sight to the blind, to<br>
proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord and the day of recompense,<br>
to comfort all that mourn.</I></p>

<p>Barnabas 15:1<br>
 Moreover concerning the Sabbath likewise it is written in the Ten<br>
Words, in which He spake to Moses face to face on Mount Sinai; <I>And<br>
ye shall hallow the Sabbath of the Lord with pure hands and with a<br>
pure heart.</I></p>

<p>Barnabas 15:2<br>
And in another place He saith; <I>If my sons observe the Sabbath then<br>
I will bestow My mercy upon them.</I></p>

<p>Barnabas 15:3<br>
Of the Sabbath He speaketh in the beginning of the creation; <I>And<br>
God made the works of His hands in six days, and He ended on the<br>
seventh day, and rested on it, and He hallowed it.</I></p>

<p>Barnabas 15:4<br>
Give heed, children, what this meaneth; <I>He ended in six days.</I> He<br>
meaneth this, that in six thousand years the Lord shall bring all<br>
things to an end; for the day with Him signifyeth a thousand years;<br>
and this He himself beareth me witness, saying; <I>Behold, the day of<br>
the Lord shall be as a thousand years.</I> Therefore, children, in six<br>
days, that is in six thousand years, everything shall come to an end.</p>

<p>
Barnabas 15:5<br>
<I>And He rested on the seventh day.</I> this He meaneth; when His Son<br>
shall come, and shall abolish the time of the Lawless One, and shall<br>
judge the ungodly, and shall change the sun and the moon and the<br>
stars, then shall he truly rest on the seventh day.</p>

<p>Barnabas 15:6<br>
Yea and furthermore He saith; <I>Thou shalt hallow it with pure hands<br>
and with a pure heart.</I> If therefore a man is able now to hallow<br>
the day which God hallowed, though he be pure in heart, we have gone<br>
utterly astray.</p>

<p>Barnabas 15:7<br>
But if after all then and not till then shall we truly rest and<br>
hallow it, when we shall ourselves be able to do so after being<br>
justified and receiving the promise, when iniquity is no more and all<br>
things have been made new by the Lord, we shall be able to hallow it<br>
then, because we ourselves shall have been hallowed first.</p>

<p>Barnabas 15:8<br>
Finally He saith to them; <I>Your new moons and your Sabbaths I cannot<br>
away with.</I> Ye see what is His meaning ; it is not your present<br>
Sabbaths that are acceptable [unto Me], but the Sabbath which I have<br>
made, in the which, when I have set all things at rest, I will make<br>
the beginning of the eighth day which is the beginning of another<br>
world.</p>

<p>Barnabas 15:9<br>
Wherefore also we keep the eighth day for rejoicing, in the which<br>
also Jesus rose from the dead, and having been manifested ascended<br>
into the heavens.</p>

<p>Barnabas 16:1<br>
 Moreover I will tell you likewise concerning the temple, how these<br>
wretched men being led astray set their hope on the building, and not<br>
on their God that made them, as being a house of God.</p>

<p>Barnabas 16:2<br>
For like the Gentiles almost they consecrated Him in the temple. But<br>
what saith the Lord abolishing the temple? Learn ye. <I>Who hath<br>
measured the heaven with a span, or hath measured the earth with<br>
his hand? Have not I, saith the Lord? The heaven is My throne and<br>
the earth the footstool of My feet. What manner of house will ye<br>
build for Me? Or what shall be my resting place?</I> Ye perceive that<br>
their hope is vain.</p>

<p>Barnabas 16:3<br>
Furthermore He saith again; <I>Behold they that pulled down this<br>
temple themselves shall build it.</I></p>

<p>Barnabas 16:4<br>
So it cometh to pass; for because they went to war it was pulled down<br>
by their enemies. Now also the very servants of their enemies shall<br>
build it up.</p>

<p>Barnabas 16:5<br>
Again, it was revealed how the city and the temple and the people of<br>
Israel should be betrayed. For the scripture saith; <I>And it shall be<br>
in the last days, that the Lord shall deliver up the sheep of the<br>
pasture and the fold and the tower thereof to destruction.</I> And it<br>
came to pass as the Lord spake.</p>

<p>Barnabas 16:6<br>
But let us enquire whether there be any temple of God. There is; in<br>
the place where he himself undertakes to make and finish it. For it<br>
is written <I>And it shall come to pass, when the week is being<br>
accomplished, the temple of God shall be built gloriously in the<br>
name of the Lord.</I></p>

<p>Barnabas 16:7<br>
I find then that there is a temple, How then shall it be built in<br>
the name of the Lord? Understand ye. Before we believed on God, the<br>
abode of our heart was corrupt and weak, a temple truly built by<br>
hands; for it was full of idolatry and was a house of demons, because<br>
we did whatsoever was contrary to God.</p>

<p>Barnabas 16:8<br>
<I>But it shall be built in the name of the Lord.</I> Give heed then that<br>
the temple of the Lord may be built gloriously.</p>

<p>Barnabas 16:9<br>
How? Understand ye. By receiving the remission of our sins and<br>
hoping on the Name we became new, created afresh from the beginning.<br>
Wherefore God dwelleth truly in our habitation within us. How? The<br>
word of his faith, the calling of his promise, the wisdom of the<br>
ordinances, the commandments of the teaching, He Himself prophesying<br>
in us, He Himself dwelling in us, opening for us who had been in<br>
bondage unto death the door of the temple, which is the mouth, and<br>
giving us repentance leadeth us to the incorruptible temple.</p>

<p>Barnabas 16:10<br>
For he that desireth to be saved looketh not to the man, but to Him<br>
that dwelleth and speaketh in him, being amazed at this that he has<br>
never at any time heard these words from the mouth of the speaker,<br>
nor himself ever desired to hear them. This is the spiritual temple<br>
built up to the Lord.</p>

<p>Barnabas 17:1<br>
 So far as it was possible with all simplicity to declare it unto<br>
you, my soul hopeth that I have not omitted anything [of the matters<br>
pertaining unto salvation and so failed in my desire].</p>

<p>Barnabas 17:2<br>
For if I should write to you concerning things immediate or future,<br>
ye would not understand them, because they are put in parables. So<br>
much then for this.</p>

<p>Barnabas 18:1<br>
 But let us pass on to another lesson and teaching. There are two<br>
ways of teaching and of power, the one of light and the other of<br>
darkness; and there is a great difference between the two ways. For<br>
on the one are stationed the light giving angels of God, on the other<br>
the angels of Satan.</p>

<p>Barnabas 18:2<br>
And the one is the Lord from all eternity and unto all eternity,<br>
whereas the other is Lord of the season of iniquity that now is.</p>

<p>Barnabas 19:1<br>
 This then is the way of light, if anyone desiring to travel on the<br>
way to his appointed place would be zealous in his works. The<br>
knowledge then which is given to us whereby we may walk therein is as<br>
follows.</p>

<p>Barnabas 19:2<br>
Thou shalt love Him that made thee, thou shalt fear Him that created<br>
thee, thou shalt glorify Him that redeemed thee from death; thou<br>
shalt be simple in heart and rich in spirit; thou shalt not cleave to<br>
those who walk the way of death; thou shalt hate everything that is<br>
not pleasing to God; thou shalt hate all hypocrisy; thou shalt never<br>
forsake the commandments of the Lord.</p>

<p>Barnabas 19:3<br>
Thou shalt not exalt thyself, but shalt be lowly minded in all<br>
things. Thou shalt not assume glory to thyself. Thou shalt not<br>
entertain a wicked design against thy neighbor; thou shalt not admit<br>
boldness into thy soul.</p>

<p>Barnabas 19:4<br>
Thou shalt not commit fornication, <I>thou shalt not commit <br>
adultery</I>, thou shalt not corrupt boys. The word of God shall not<br>
come forth from thee where any are unclean. Thou shalt not make a<br>
difference in a person to reprove him for a transgression. Thou shalt<br>
be meek, thou shalt be <I>quiet</I>, thou shalt be <I>fearing the words</I><br>
which thou hast heard. Thou shalt not bear a grudge against thy<br>
brother.</p>

<p>Barnabas 19:5<br>
Thou shalt not doubt whether a thing shall be or not be. <I>Thou shalt<br>
not take the name of the Lord in vain.</I> Thou shalt love thy<br>
neighbor more than thine own soul. Thou shalt not murder a child by<br>
abortion, nor again shalt thou kill it when it is born. Thou shalt<br>
not withhold thy hand from thy son or daughter, but from their youth<br>
thou shalt teach them the fear of God.</p>

<p>Barnabas 19:6<br>
Thou shalt not be found coveting thy neighbors goods; thou shalt not<br>
be found greedy of gain. Neither shalt thou cleave with thy soul to<br>
the lofty, but shalt walk with the humble and righteous. The<br>
accidents that befall thee thou shalt receive as good, knowing that<br>
nothing is done without God. Thou shalt not be double minded nor<br>
double tongued.</p>

<p>Barnabas 19:7<br>
Thou shalt be subject unto thy masters as to a type of God in shame<br>
and fear. Thou shalt not command in bitterness thy bondservant or<br>
thine handmaid who set their hope on the same God, lest haply, they<br>
should cease to fear the God who is over both of you; for He came not<br>
to call with respect of persons, but to call those whom the Spirit<br>
hath prepared.</p>

<p>Barnabas 19:8<br>
Thou shalt make thy neighbor partake in all things, and shalt not say<br>
<I>that anything is thine own.</I> For if ye are fellow partakers in that<br>
which is imperishable, how much rather shall ye be in the things<br>
which are perishable. Thou shalt not be hasty with thine own tongue,<br>
for the mouth is the snare of death. So far as thou art able, thou<br>
shalt be pure for thy soul's sake.</p>

<p>Barnabas 19:9<br>
<I>Be not thou found holding out thy hands to receive, and drawing<br>
them in to give.</I> Thou shalt love as the apple of thine eye every<br>
one <I>that speaketh unto thee the word of the Lord.<br>
</I><br>
Barnabas 19:10<br>
<I>Thou shalt remember</I> the day of judgment night and day, and thou<br>
shalt seek out day by day the persons of the saints, either laboring<br>
by word and going to exhort them and meditating how thou mayest save<br>
souls by thy word, or thou shalt work with thy hands for a ransom for<br>
thy sins.</p>

<p>Barnabas 19:11<br>
Thou shall not hesitate to give, neither shalt thou murmur when<br>
giving, but thou shalt know who is the good paymaster of thy reward.<br>
Thou shalt keep those things which thou hast received, neither adding<br>
to them nor taking away from them. Thou shalt utterly hate the Evil<br>
One. Thou shalt judge righteously.</p>

<p>Barnabas 19:12<br>
Thou shalt not make a schism, but thou shalt pacify them that contend<br>
by bringing them together. Thou shalt confess thy sins. Thou shalt<br>
not betake thyself to prayer with an evil conscience. This is the<br>
way of light.</p>

<p>Barnabas 20:1<br>
 But the way of the Black One is crooked and full of a curse. For it<br>
is a way of eternal death with punishment wherein are the things that<br>
destroy men's souls--idolatry, boldness, exhalation of power,<br>
hypocrisy, doubleness of heart, adultery, murder, plundering, pride,<br>
transgression, treachery, malice, stubbornness, witchcraft, magic,<br>
covetousness, absence of the fear of God;</p>

<p>Barnabas 20:2<br>
persecutors of good men, hating the truth, loving lies, not<br>
perceiving the reward of righteousness, not <I>cleaving to the good</I><br>
nor to the righteous judgment, paying no heed to the widow and the<br>
orphan, wakeful not for the fear of God but for that which is evil;<br>
men from whom gentleness and forbearance stand aloof and far off;<br>
loving vain things, pursuing a recompense, not pitying the poor man,<br>
not toiling for him that is oppressed with toil, ready to slander,<br>
not recognizing Him that made them murderers of children, corrupters<br>
of the creatures of God, turning away from him that is in want,<br>
oppressing him that is afflicted, advocates of the wealthy, unjust<br>
judges of the poor, sinful in all things.</p>

<p>Barnabas 21:1<br>
 It is good therefore to learn the ordinances of the Lord, as many as<br>
have been written above, and to walk in them. For he that doeth these<br>
things shall be glorified in the kingdom of God; whereas he that<br>
chooseth their opposites shall perish together with his works. For<br>
this cause is the resurrection, for this the recompense.</p>

<p>Barnabas 21:2<br>
I entreat those of you who are in a higher station, if ye will<br>
receive any counsel of good advice from me, keep amongst you those to<br>
whom ye may do good. Fail not.</p>

<p>Barnabas 21:3<br>
The day is at hand, in which everything shall be destroyed together<br>
with the Evil One. <I>The Lord is at hand and his reward.</I></p>

<p>Barnabas 21:4<br>
Again and again I entreat you; be good lawgivers one to another;<br>
continue faithful councilors to yourselves; take away from you all<br>
hypocrisy.</p>

<p>Barnabas 21:5<br>
And may God, who is Lord of the whole world, give you wisdom,<br>
judgment, learning, knowledge of His ordinances, patience.</p>

<p>Barnabas 21:6<br>
And be ye taught of God, seeking diligently what the Lord requireth<br>
of you, and act that ye may be found in the day of judgment.</p>

<p>Barnabas 21:7<br>
But if you have any remembrance of good, call me to mind when ye<br>
practice these things these things, that both my desire and my<br>
watchfulness may lead to some good result. I entreat you asking it<br>
as a favor.</p>

<p>Barnabas 21:8<br>
So long as the good vessel (of the body) is with you, be lacking in<br>
none of these things, but search them out constantly, and fulfill<br>
every commandment; for they deserve it.</p>

<p>Barnabas 21:9<br>
For this reason I was the more eager to write to you so far as I was<br>
able, that I might give you joy. Fare ye well, children of love and<br>
peace. The Lord of glory and of every grace be with your spirit.</p>
