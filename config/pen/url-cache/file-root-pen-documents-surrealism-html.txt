<h1>Surrealism</h1>
<p>Surrealism, whose origins lay in the creation
of automatic painting, was inspired by the
experiences of the surrealists, who
deliberately induced trances, expanded their
awareness, and recorded their experiences in
writing.</p>

<p>Surrealistic works includeautomatic writing,
non-traditional uses of language and visual
imagery, and the use of chance to create a
nonsensical word order.</p>
<p>The boundaries between oneiric fantasy and
literary interpretation are fluid.</p>
<p>The ambiguous juxtaposition of seemingly
incongruous elements gives rise to many
interpretations.</p>  <ul><li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surreal_art">Surrealism</a></li></ul><p><br />The ambiguous juxtaposition of seemingly incongruous elements gives rise to many interpretations.<br />In one reading, the image is a representation of the duality of man's conceptualization and experience of the unseen.<br />Allusions to the unconscious or unconscious processes are common.<br />Surrealism emerged in France in the aftermath of World War I, following the linguistic and cultural revolution that shook up traditional modes of thought.[2] The first work of artists to be de-claimed as surrealist was Portrait of Joan Mir√≥, though others might say that Picasso's Surrealist portraits pre-date surrealism proper.</p></body></html>
