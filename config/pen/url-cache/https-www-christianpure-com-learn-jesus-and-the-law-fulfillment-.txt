While many perceive Jesus as a revolutionary figure who discarded the law, he emphasized its completion and true meaning. Rather than disregarding the law, Jesus sought to provide a deeper understanding and interpretation of its requirements.</p><p>Jesus firmly stated, &quot;Do not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them&quot; (Matthew 5:17). Jesus establishes his role as the fulfillment of the law, not its abolisher. He recognizes the law&apos;s significance and conveys the need to fully comprehend its essence.</p><p>Jesus positions himself as a new law giver, surpassing prior interpretations and providing an authoritative understanding of the law&rsquo;s requirements. He asserts, &quot;You have heard that it was said...but I tell you&quot; (Matthew 5:21-22). Jesus challenges traditional interpretations and equates his authority to that of God&apos;s, reshaping the understanding of the law.</p><p>The fulfillment of the law, according to Jesus, entails obedience to its requirements at a profound level&mdash;beyond mere external observance. He emphasizes the importance of internal disposition, teaching that anger harbored against others is akin to murder in the heart (Matthew 5:21-26). Jesus complements but surpasses the law&apos;s external legalism and exposes the true intent outlined in the commandments.</p><h2>What Did Jesus Fulfill?</h2><p>Jesus fulfilled numerous prophecies and the Old Testament in many ways, establishing his role as the long-awaited Messiah. The Old Testament scriptures contain countless prophecies that foretold the coming of the Savior, and Jesus fulfilled these prophecies through his birth, life, death, and resurrection.</p><p>One significant aspect in which Jesus fulfilled the Old Testament was his role as the Messiah, the Anointed One. The Jews had been anticipating the arrival of the Messiah as promised in the Old Testament scriptures. Jesus, through his teachings and miracles, clearly portrayed himself as the long-awaited Messiah, fulfilling the hopes and expectations of the people.</p><p>Jesus fulfilled the Law and the teachings of the prophets as outlined in the Old Testament. He stated in Matthew 5:17, &quot;Do not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them.&quot; Jesus perfectly fulfilled the requirements of the Law, which humans had failed to do, and became the ultimate sacrifice for the sins of humanity.</p><p>Jesus&apos; first coming fulfilled the prophecies of his birth, lineage, and ministry. The prophet Isaiah spoke of a virgin giving birth to a child (Isaiah 7:14), which came to pass with the miraculous virgin birth of Jesus through Mary. The prophet Micah also prophesied that the Messiah would be born in Bethlehem (Micah 5:2), and Jesus&apos; birth in Bethlehem fulfilled this prophecy.</p><p>While Jesus fulfilled countless prophecies during his first coming, there are still prophecies that await fulfillment during his second coming. The Old Testament scriptures contain numerous prophecies about the end times and the return of the Messiah. These prophecies include the establishment of God&apos;s Kingdom and the judgment of all people.</p><p>Jesus fulfilled the prophecies, role as Messiah, and laws of the Old Testament scriptures. His birth, life, death, and resurrection prove his fulfillment of the Old Testament. While some prophecies have been fulfilled through his first coming, we still anticipate the fulfillment of prophecies regarding his second coming and the establishment of God&apos;s Kingdom.</p><h2>The Meaning of Matthew 5:17-20</h2><p>Jesus delivers a profound message in Matthew 5:17-20 in the Gospel of Matthew. These verses provide insight into the meaning behind Jesus&apos; purpose in fulfilling the Law of Moses. This passage offers a glimpse into the importance of Jesus&apos; teachings and the significance of his role as the fulfillment of ancient prophecies. In a concise and influential manner, Jesus reaffirms the relevance of the Law and the Prophets while highlighting the need for righteousness that surpasses that of the religious leaders. Through these verses, Jesus lays the foundation for his transformative teachings, emphasizing the importance of understanding the true meaning and intentions of the Law.</p><h2>What Does It Mean to &quot;Fulfill&quot; the Law?</h2><p>Fulfilling the law is of utmost importance in understanding the significance of Jesus about the law. It refers to completing, realizing, or accomplishing the law&apos;s purpose. In the background information, it is revealed that the Mosaic Law, composed of commandments and instructions given to the Israelites in the Old Testament, served as a moral and legal framework for their lives. However, Jesus came as the Messiah to bring about a new covenant, and in doing so, he fulfilled the law.</p><p>Jesus stated in the Gospel of Matthew that he did not come to abolish the law but to fulfill it. He exemplified this by adhering to the law and interpreting it in a way that brought out its true meaning and intent. Jesus taught the people that the law goes beyond mere external observance and includes the heart and motives behind one&apos;s actions.</p><p>The significance of fulfilling the law lies in Christ Jesus&apos; ability to perfectly embody and satisfy its requirements. Through his life, death, and resurrection, he fulfilled the law&rsquo;s demands and provided a new way for humanity to enter a right relationship with God. By accepting Jesus as their Savior, individuals no longer have to rely on strict adherence to the law for salvation, but instead can receive forgiveness and grace through faith in him. Thus, Jesus&apos; fulfillment of the law is crucial in understanding the transformative power of his message and mission.</p><h2>Legal Obedience or Something More?</h2><p>Regarding legal obedience, it is crucial to go beyond simply following the law and consider ethical considerations. Legal obedience refers to adherence to laws and regulations to avoid legal consequences, but it should also encompass an understanding of the broader ethical implications.</p><p>Ethical considerations extend beyond mere legality, focusing on what is morally right and just. While a specific action may be legal, it may still be ethically questionable. Thus, legal obedience should consider the larger ethical framework, evaluating whether the action aligns with fairness, honesty, and societal well-being principles.</p><p>Understanding the intent and purpose behind laws and regulations is equally important. Laws are not created arbitrarily but intended to serve a particular purpose and promote the common good. By comprehending these underlying intentions and objectives, individuals can avoid misinterpretation or misuse of the law. Such understanding empowers individuals to make informed decisions that align with both legal requirements and ethical principles.</p><h2>How Did Jesus Fulfill the Law of Moses?</h2><p>Jesus fulfilled the law of Moses by accomplishing its dual purpose: to reveal human sinfulness and to point people towards their need for a Savior. The law of Moses, which consists of the commandments and regulations found in the Old Testament, was given by God to the people of Israel through the prophet Moses.</p><p>The purpose of the law was two-fold. Firstly, it served as a divine standard that showed people their inability to obey God&rsquo;s commands perfectly. It revealed the depth of human sin and the need for redemption. No one could keep the law perfectly; therefore, everyone fell short of God&apos;s standards. This highlighted the need for forgiveness and a means of atonement.</p><p>Secondly, the law foreshadowed and pointed towards the coming of Jesus Christ. He was the fulfillment of the law, meaning that he perfectly kept every requirement of it. Jesus lived a sinless life, completely obedient to God&apos;s commands. He fulfilled the law&apos;s demand for righteousness that no human could achieve.</p><p>In fulfilling the law, Jesus did not abolish it but brought it to completion. He declared in Matthew 5:17, &quot;Do not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them.&quot; Through his life, death, and resurrection, Jesus became the ultimate sacrifice for sin, replacing the need for animal sacrifices required by the Mosaic law.</p><p>Jesus fulfilled the law of Moses by perfectly obeying its requirements and offering himself as the ultimate sacrifice for sin. He accomplished the law&apos;s purpose by revealing human sinfulness and pointing people towards their need for a Savior. Jesus brought the law to its intended completion, allowing people to be reconciled with God through faith in him.</p><h2>Who Came to Fulfill the Old Testament?</h2><p>The New Testament is often regarded as the fulfillment of the Old Testament, with numerous prophecies, laws. It promises their completion in the person of Jesus Christ and establishing the Christian faith. In this article, we will explore who came to fulfill the Old Testament, shedding light on the significance of this fulfillment and its role in the Christian understanding of salvation and God&apos;s redemptive plan for humanity.</p><h2>Jesus Christ:</h2><p>At the center of the New Testament&apos;s fulfillment of the Old Testament is Jesus Christ, who claimed to be the long-awaited Messiah and the Son of God. According to the Gospels, Jesus affirmed the authority and validity of the Old Testament scriptures and declared that he had come not to abolish the Law and the Prophets but to fulfill them. Through his life, teachings, death, and resurrection, Jesus brought about the culmination of the promises and purposes God had revealed to his people in the Old Testament. By living a sinless life and offering himself as the ultimate sacrifice for sin, Jesus ushered in a new covenant and opened the way for humanity to be reconciled with God.</p><h2>The Significance of Fulfillment:</h2><p>The concept of fulfillment in the New Testament underscores the continuity between the Old and New Covenants, revealing the divine coherence and intentionality throughout the biblical narrative. The fulfillment of the Old Testament in Jesus Christ highlights the faithfulness and trustworthiness of God in bringing about his promises outlined in the ancient scriptures. it confirms that God&apos;s plan for salvation and redemption has been realized through Jesus, establishing him as the long-awaited Savior and fulfillment of various messianic prophecies. Understanding the fulfillment of the Old Testament in Jesus Christ is essential to grasp the core message of Christianity and the significance of his life, death, and resurrection in bringing about salvation and eternal life.</p><h2>John the Baptist and His Role in Fulfilling Prophecy</h2><p>John the Baptist was pivotal in fulfilling prophecy and establishing the significance of Jesus&apos; arrival. As a prophet, John declared the coming of the Messiah and prepared the way for his ministry. This fulfilled the ancient prophecies in the Scriptures, which spoke of a messenger preparing the people&rsquo;s hearts for the Messiah&apos;s arrival.</p><p>John&apos;s significance lies in his ability to bridge the gap between the Old and New Testaments. He fulfilled prophecies from the past and laid the groundwork for Jesus&apos; approach to Scripture. Just as John emphasized the importance of repentance and turning towards God, Jesus also upheld and fulfilled the laws and prophecies of the Old Testament.</p><p>In his ministry, John exhibited a deep understanding of Scripture. He proclaimed, &quot;I baptize you with water for repentance. But after me comes one who is more powerful than I, whose sandals I am not worthy to carry. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire.&quot; (Matthew 3:11) This declaration alludes to the prophecies found in the Old Testament regarding the coming of the Messiah and his empowering work.</p><p>John the Baptist&apos;s role in fulfilling prophecy is a crucial link between the promises of the past and their fulfillment in Jesus. By introducing and preparing the way for Jesus&apos; ministry, John establishes the importance of Scripture and the continuity between the Old and New Testaments.</p><h2>The True Meaning Behind Jesus&apos; Words in Matthew 5:17-18</h2><p>In Matthew 5:17-18, Jesus says, &quot;Do not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them. I tell you that until heaven and earth disappear, not the smallest letter, not the least stroke of a pen, will by any means disappear from the Law until everything is accomplished.&quot;</p><p>These verses are often misunderstood, leading to confusion about what Jesus meant when he said he came to fulfill the Law and the Prophets. Some interpret this to mean that Jesus abolished and replaced the Old Testament laws with new ones. However, this interpretation is not accurate.</p><p>The key to understanding the true meaning behind Jesus&apos; words lies in the phrase &quot;fulfill them.&quot; Jesus did not come to do away with the Law and the Prophets but to complete them. He came to bring the true essence and purpose of the Old Testament teachings to fruition. Instead of nullifying the previous laws, Jesus fulfilled them by perfectly embodying their intentions and fulfilling their requirements through his life, death, and resurrection.</p><p>Jesus clarifies that not even the smallest detail of the Law will disappear until everything is accomplished. He emphasizes the enduring nature of the Law and the Prophets until the establishment of God&apos;s kingdom on earth. Therefore, Jesus&apos; words in Matthew 5:17-18 affirm the continuity and significance of the Old Testament teachings while shedding light on their ultimate fulfillment in him.</p><p>Jesus&apos; words in Matthew 5:17-18 were not meant to undermine the importance of the Law and the Prophets but rather to reveal their true meaning. He came to fulfill, complete, and demonstrate the true essence of these teachings. It is essential to recognize this true meaning to avoid misunderstanding and appreciate the continuous relevance of the Old Testament in the life and teachings of Jesus.</p><h2>Did Jesus Do Away with the Law?</h2><p>The question of whether Jesus did away with the law is a contentious and deeply theological one. It delves into the relationship between the Old and New Testaments, the nature of Jesus&apos; teachings, and the role of law in the life of a Christian. Some argue that Jesus fulfilled the law, rendering it unnecessary, while others assert that he reinforced its importance. To explore this topic, we will examine various biblical passages, the interpretations of theologians, and the historical context to gain a comprehensive understanding of Jesus&apos; relationship to the law. We aim to shed light on this complex and thought-provoking question by doing so.</p><h2>The Relationship Between Jesus, Covenant Law, and Animal Sacrifices</h2><p>In the context of the background information, the relationship between Jesus, covenant law, and animal sacrifices is significant and interconnected. Covenant law refers to the set of laws and regulations established by God in the Hebrew Bible to guide the relationship between God and His people. These laws encompassed various aspects of daily life, including religious rituals and sacrifices.</p><p>Animal sacrifices were an integral part of the Israelite covenant system, serving to seek forgiveness for sins and reconcile with God. However, these sacrifices were temporary and symbolic, unable to offer permanent atonement for sins. This is where Jesus enters the picture.</p><p>According to Christian belief, Jesus is considered the fulfillment of the covenant law and the ultimate sacrifice for humanity&apos;s sins. His life, death, and resurrection are seen as the perfect sacrifice that provides eternal forgiveness and reconciliation with God. Through his sacrificial death, Jesus was the ultimate and final Lamb of God, whose blood atoned for the sins of all people.</p><p>Therefore, Jesus&apos; role as the Messiah supersedes the need for animal sacrifices. His sacrifice represents a new covenant based on grace and redemption rather than the strict adherence to the Mosaic law. Jesus, by fulfilling the covenant law and offering himself as the ultimate sacrifice, establishes a new way for believers to connect with God, ultimately establishing a personal relationship with Him.</p><h2>Understanding Carnal Commandments vs. Spiritual Commandments</h2><p>The Sermon on the Mount, a pivotal teaching of Jesus Christ, contains a profound distinction between carnal and spiritual commandments. Carnal commandments primarily focus on external actions and adherence to the letter of the law. In contrast, spiritual commandments emphasize the internal state of the heart and surpass the mere observance of rules.</p><p>In the Sermon on the Mount, Jesus reveals the spiritual meaning and application of the commandments, going beyond the strict letter of the law. For instance, Jesus states, &quot;You have heard that it was said, &apos;You shall not commit adultery.&apos;&quot; Here, Jesus addresses the carnal commandment against physical adultery. However, He then elucidates the spiritual commandment by saying, &quot;But I tell you that anyone who looks at a woman lustfully has already committed adultery with her in his heart.&quot; Jesus urges His followers to focus on the intent and desires of their hearts, rather than just the external actions.</p><p>Jesus challenges his disciples to love their friends and enemies, turn the other cheek when faced with aggression, and pray for those who persecute them. These teachings of Jesus demonstrate the transformative power of spiritual commandments, calling for a radical change in attitudes and actions, promoting love, forgiveness, and compassion.</p><p>Jesus Christ&apos;s teachings in the Sermon on the Mount highlight the distinction between carnal and spiritual commandments. He reveals the profound spiritual meaning behind the commandments, emphasizing the importance of intentions, thoughts, and attitudes rather than mere compliance with external rules. By embracing these spiritual commandments, individuals can experience deeper personal growth and a closer relationship with God.</p><h2>How Does Jesus&apos; Perfect Life and Sacrifice Meet Our Need for Redemption?</h2><p>Jesus&apos; perfect life and sacrifice perfectly meet our need for redemption by providing the ultimate solution to the problem of sin. His sinless life is significant because it shows us what living perfectly obeying God&rsquo;s commands means. In a world filled with brokenness and disobedience, Jesus&apos; life is a perfect example of righteousness and holiness.</p><p>However, Jesus&apos; sinless life alone does not secure our redemption. Through his atoning death on the cross, our sins are forgiven and we are reconciled to God. Jesus&apos; death is the ultimate sacrifice, satisfying the demands of justice for our sins. His blood was shed to cleanse us from all unrighteousness and restore our relationship with God.</p><p>Additionally, Jesus&apos; death and resurrection fulfill the law and God&apos;s covenant with his people. With its many regulations and sacrifices, the law could not bring about true redemption. Jesus, as the fulfillment of the law, offers a better covenant through his death and resurrection. Through his sacrifice, we are no longer bound by the law but are set free to live by the Spirit.</p><p>This freedom from sin enables believers to live a life that honors God. Living according to the Spirit empowers us to resist sin&rsquo;s temptations and walk in righteousness. Jesus&apos; perfect life and perfect sacrifice provide redemption and enable us to experience true freedom from sin and live a life that brings glory to God.</p><p>Jesus&apos; perfect life and sacrifice meet our need for redemption by demonstrating the required obedience and satisfying the demands of justice through his atoning death on the cross. Through his resurrection, he fulfills the law and God&apos;s covenant, allowing believers to be reconciled to God. This reconciliation allows us to live by the Spirit and experience true freedom from sin, living a life that honors God.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>The significance of Jesus in fulfilling the law cannot be overstated in the Christian faith. Through his life, teachings, death, and resurrection, Jesus accomplished what the law could not - providing salvation to all who believe in him.</p><p>Jesus, as the long-awaited Messiah, came to fulfill the Old Testament&rsquo;s law and prophecies. He emphasized the importance of the law but also went beyond its mere observance, teaching that true righteousness goes beyond outward actions and begins in the heart. Jesus embodied the fulfillment of the law by perfectly keeping it and offering himself as a sacrifice for humanity&apos;s sins.</p><p>The Christian faith is rooted in the belief that Jesus is the savior of mankind. Through his sacrificial death, he paid the penalty for our sins and made a way for us to be reconciled with God. We find true and eternal salvation by accepting Jesus as our savior and following his teachings.</p></div></div><section id="FAQ" class="w-layout-blockcontainer container-tfaq rich-text w-container"><h1 class="takeawaysfaq">Frequently asked questions</h1><div class="rich-text faq w-richtext"><h3>How did Jesus&apos;
