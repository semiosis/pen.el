Read freely text sermons and articles by the speaker Andrew Bonar in text and pdf format. He was a well-known pastor in Scotland with the Free Church. His brother Horatius was another well-known minister who was contemporary with Robert Murray Mchyene and others in those days. They saw a move of revival in their churches where the Spirit brought many immediate conversations in a short period of time.
<p>
He is best known for his work on compiling the life of the prophet of Dundee: Robert Murray Mchyene: "Memoir and Remains of Robert Murray McCheyne." One cannot read this volume and feel the sobriety of eternity and the fear of the Lord. He also wrote a wonderful volume on Leviticus.<br></td></tr></TABLE></td></tr></table>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
There is a practical error very common among God's people. All of them profess to believe that the Holy Spirit may convert souls at any age, and that conversion cannot take place too soon; while yet they do not look for the conversion of children with t ... <a href="index7290.html?view=article&amp;aid=33018">read more</a><br><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Psalm 103: 1-5
IN this psalm we find the Psalmist standing at the golden altar with his harp in his hand, recounting all his mercies. This psalm teaches us adoration.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'A time to keep silence and a time to speak'

We can draw a great deal of instruction from Christ's silence.

IT is, as we would say, an old custom of God's to keep silence when we would have expected Him to speak. Of old God's silence was meant to lead men to fear. We need not wonde ... <a href="index52e9.html?view=article&amp;aid=12">read more</a><br><br>

JOHN the Baptist lay in prison unnoticed, and we may say uncared for, for nearly a year. How mysterious! No wonder he sent to ask the Master if there was any explanation of this.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The natural man is exceedingly perverse, and Satan knows how to wield this perversity of the heart.
