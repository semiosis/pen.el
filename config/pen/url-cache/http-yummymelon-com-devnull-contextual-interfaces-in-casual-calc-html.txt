<h1 class='articleTitle'>Contextual Interfaces in Casual Calc</h1>
<p>05 Aug 2024&nbsp;&nbsp;Charles Choi</p>


<div class='articleBase'>
<p>A compelling idea in the <a href="https://github.com/magit/transient">Transient</a> UI package is the ability to craft interfaces where commands specific to a context can be discovered and used. Such <em>contextual interfaces</em> enable a user to easily orchestrate and repeat such commands, particularly when the interface is raised and persisted. This allows the user to better focus on the task at hand.</p>
<p>The most recent update to Casual Calc <a href="https://github.com/kickingvegas/casual-calc/releases/tag/1.11.0">v1.11.0</a> has made changes to be more contextual. In particular:</p>
<ol>
<li>Menus stay raised until explicitly dismissed.</li>
<li>Basic calculator operation is enabled when a menu is raised.</li>
</ol>
<p>These UI changes have been applied to nearly all the menus in Casual Calc. To facilitate basic calculator operation algebraic entry is now supported via the <code>'</code> binding. Arithmetic operators (add, subtract, multiply, divide, modulo) are made available on menus as well.</p>
<p>Shown below is a screenshot of the binary functions menu to illustrate a contextual interface at work. Commands that are common to working with binary and digital radix represented values are provided for and can be repeated or orchestrated with each other.</p>
<p><img src='./images/contextual-interfaces-in-calc/calc-binary-menu.png' width='800' /></p>
<p>In the latest release of <a href="https://github.com/kickingvegas/casual-calc/">Casual Calc</a>, all function and arithmetic sections offer their own contextual behavior, each section being akin to a “mini-app” with respect to a functional area of interest such as trigonometry, logarithms, rounding, time, random, conversions, and many others.</p>
<h1>Closing Thoughts</h1>
<p>Although historically the primary interface for Emacs Calc has been a prompt, it is in many ways an unnatural one. Real calculators offer dedicated buttons for commands. Particularly for the HP-28S calculator (a primary influence on the design of Emacs Calc), it offered soft-key buttons to map to different commands based on a mode. Persisted contextual interfaces in Casual Calc brings it closer to that modal push-button experience of the HP-28S.</p>
<p>If you already use Casual Calc, the update is available now. For those new to it, you can install it from <a href="https://melpa.org/#/casual-calc">MELPA</a>. Regardless, let me know what you <a href="https://github.com/kickingvegas/casual-calc/discussions">think of it</a>.</p>
