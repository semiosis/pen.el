* =Khala= - An HTTP server for prompting

=Khala= is the Mind-to-Mind interface for =Pen.el=.

"The Khala was created in our darkest moment. Only its light was able to bind
our people-to give us unity. We are born into it, and when we die, our spirits
become one with it."

Khala is an HTTP server which connects Pen.el nodes together.
Using Khala humans and AIs can prompt eachother in a peer-to-peer network.
