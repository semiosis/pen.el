Who's Online
 
We have 1 guest
online               ok I'll give the elite synopsis of
spacer.png, 0 kB     this strategy first, then give
the  full details

FOR ELITES: basically just do your
usual 28 pop fc, but instead just
put 1 less on wood than you
usually do, and 3-4 on stone b4 u
start putting people on gold; end
with 3 on gold and 3-4 on stone,
for 30 pop; that's dark age; read
later for feudal and later ages.

 

FOR EVERYONE ELSE:  (numbers are
population not vil number, ie
include number 1 as the scout)

2-7: sheep (6 villagers)

8-13: wood (6 vils); make lumber
camp on wood

14: goes to lure boar.  sheep vils
stop eating their sheep when boar
arrives and eat boar.  My boar
always arrives as sheep is
finished

15-17 help eat boar; when 200 food
left on boar, one of these vils 
gets the 2nd boar (total 10 vils
eating boar)

18-21: berries, make mill (4 vils)

22-24: wood (total now 9 vils on
wood)

25-27: stone

28-30: gold (3 vils)

when the 2nd boar is finished, i
distribute the 10 boar vils as
such: i put 7 vils on sheep, 3
make farm 

 hit feudal button

 IN TRANSITION to feudal

if my stone is late (i can tell
since ive done this alot), i
usually take one wood or berry vil
and put him on stone

of the 7 vils finishing the sheep,
3 more make farms (for a total of
6 farms), and 4 will go to deer,
makiing mill there

when im almost half way to feudal,
i take one vil from stone or gold
or wood (whichever is further
ahead of schedule) and make a
barracks

 

FEUDAL AGE

IMMEDIAtely hit the wheelbarrow
button.  then make stable with the
barracks vil.  take a vil usually
from stone and make a blacksmith. 
as soon as these are done, hit
castle button

 

TRANSITION TO CASTLE AGE.  

Now, this is trickiest part.  I
need exactly 650 stone as soon as
i hit castle age at around
18minutes.  if i think i'll be
short, i put all the berry or deer
vils (whoever is closest) on to
the stone; i may even bring some
woodies over if they are needed. 
usually i add the deer vils or the
berry vils only, but if you went
with 4 on stone, this might not be
needed.  

 I get the chopping and the gold
and the mill upgrade, and often
get the hoarding upgrade all
during transition, I'm not
kidding, the eco is that good.

CASTLE AGE

in castle age, i immediately begin
making knights.  new vils will go
at first to gold (2 or 3 vils)
then to farms until i have 17-20
farms. (if you had sent your berry
vils to stone, then the deer
miners would go to berries at this
point)

AS SOON as i hit castle age, i
make a castle to defend my
resources with all the stone
miners and maybe some wood or
other vils, depends if im afraid
of sudden attack.  The castle
making vils all go to the gold
pile, for 10 gold miners usually.

 Once the castle is up, i gather
all the knights and the conqs
being made (nonstop production) to
the far end of my base that is not
defended by the castle.  If that
side of hte base is attacked, the
conqs can usually stand close
enough to the castle to be
defended by it, but close enough
to the attacking army to hit it
with their long range!!

 As soon a s a good group is made
of conqs and knights, i go on
attack!!

once i have 20 farmers, I usually 

 make a 2nd tc.  I usually imp
with only 2 tc's and make more in
transition, or sometimes i make 3
or 4 tc's (instead of tc's i often
make seige and start ramming in
castle, especially if i do this on
flank)

 

My advice is to read this strategy
in general, and try it without
remembering every detail; after
you do it a few times, you can
read back on my tips if you are
having a problem; there are many
ways to do this without doing it
exactly as i say.
