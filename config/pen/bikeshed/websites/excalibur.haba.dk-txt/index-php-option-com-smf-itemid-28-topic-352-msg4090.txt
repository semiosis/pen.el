810        THIS LADDER ends in may.  so it was real good
and active for a while.  I'm thinking we create
View       some buzz and make it real active for the end,
Profile    for the last week and I have an idea how to do
WWW        that.  Ima post the idea soon and we have to
spread the word around once i do.  We did
something similar for the ladder that worked
good before (aztec's second one), and that one
came down to a major face-off between bb, homie
and imac (bb won that , homie second and imac
3rd i think)

Ladder ends now officially, but once
I'm done fixing things we'll be able
to unofficially report games to the
same ladder indefinitely.
