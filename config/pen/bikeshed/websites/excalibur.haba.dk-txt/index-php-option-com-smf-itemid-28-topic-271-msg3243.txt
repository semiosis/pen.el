This is telperion, I was the celts, and
View     !Paco! was the britons, we were in the
Profile  pocket, tho we were massed in the middle. 
I "massed" like 10 onnies or so to
counteract paco's massing up longbowmen
vs. leo's chinese.  I don't remember if it
was leo said that, but I know someone did,
but it was a good game, wish we had
recorded that 4v4. Tongue

Posts:     nah haba dont worry, these guys are just
607        noobs lol

View       the thing is, longbows do beat brit, if
Profile    the brit is not good.  but if hte brit
WWW        is good, the longbows win. 

I'll explain it. 

seige onnies have a fixed range which
8+1 in post- imp (for teuts, which is
what teleperion was).  Longbows have a
range of 6+6 in post imp.  so the seige
onnies will be killed by massed lb
without killing any longbows.  In fact
this is what happens:  the seige onnie
gets close enough to kill the first few
longbows, but a few rows behind that
that the seige onnie CANT EVEN SEE hit
and kill the onnie!!

so in fact we lost the game coz
teleperion was such a newb, when i was
in middle and fighting brits plus
franks, he sent just onnies.

Now let me describe the situation:

i went to the middle, and knowing that
there were franks and brits, i made
champs halbs chukos and seige rams
(seige rams and trebs are the CORRECT)
seige vs longbows btw).  the longbow guy
massed lb, but as i tried to prepare my
rams to hit him, the frank guy kept
attackin my rams.  so i couldnt push
forward.  even the flank persian enemy
sent some paladins on me lol.

Then our ally teleprion sent the nooby
seige onnies, and they were killed.  In
fact, when i tried to send the seige
rams i had forward, his idiotic onnies
killed some of my rams lol.  we really
needed teuts to make something like bb
cannons or paladins/skirm/trebs to be
honest. 

To make it worse, stormwind was goth,
and was making cav archers vs persians
on the flank lol.

so i think we need to talk about what
are the right units to kill the right
enemy civ/army, so that we learn better
for future games to be less disastrous

with mac lag, seige beats pretty much
View     everything. longbows do not own seige
Profile  onagers in DM, dm is another game compared
to rm, the economy you can make in dm is
what allows non-stop seige and it shows
the power of seige, any civ with seige
onagers and decent rams can rape brits
absolutely, sure seige onies can get out
ranged but in dm lol it doesn't matter.

sure from RM perspective longbows can own
seige onies, but thats only because most
cant mass seige onies and still have a
huge amount of eco, so ofcourse in that
case with a bit of micro and overmassing
the seige onie masser you can beat him,
but that can apply to halbs champ mass vs
seige onies in rm...

honestly in dm brits are a weaker civ,
they can't push very well at all, because
they dont have extra treb or seige range,
they don't have decent rams... basically a
slow push civ most of the time...

the only advantage of brit is they are a
cheap civ military wise, if you can
outlast your oponent and use the gold adv
you will beat him, but in a team dm that
is not the case, since trading is normal,
with gold seige onies will always win.

Better seige is always a clear advantage
in DM.

View     ok, but in my humble opinion methinks
Profile  brits have extra range for trebs/onagers
WWW      (=siege engineer).

yeah lbs have alot of range they can kill
View     some onies, but paladins are technically
Profile  supposed to kill seige, well lol that does
not happen here... Im sure everyone has
seen pallies die to onies, the lag makes
seige extra strong, so any civ with seige
onies can pretty much walk-over brits...
teuts, sarcs, celts, korea, aztecs Grin

brit does have seige engineers but any civ
with seige onies also gets the extra
range, takes a few onies to wipe out 4
trebs, they keep pushing with trebs and
lbs have to keep moving back, in a no lag
game yeah brit can prolly kill the onies
and micro trebs but i dont see that beign
the case in a team game with lag

Posts:     well, then aztec after reading your
607        posts i've come to the following
conclusion.
View
Profile    You are probably right, that seige
WWW        onnies in a laggy game should win when 2
skilled players are playing eachother. 
However, since i've seen brits kill
seige onnies in laggy games multiple
times.. i must conclude that the person
playing the seige onnies (it was paco in
the game that trigerred this discusion,
i think) must not have been very
skilled.

And in fact, i've beat seige onnies with
lb many times, the last time of which
the seige onnies were zoze's... again,
probably the result of the seige onnie
civ not being played right, i guess.  in
the case of my game vs zoze, i think  he
was gathering them too far forward or
something, they would just walk up and
be killed b4 firing a shot, and i could
make more lb than the onnie could kill
anyway.  the trebs didnt kill any, the
lb got them all.  In the dm in question
with paco, the same thing happened, but
here it was a bit different:  the guy
playing brits had so many trash units
(skirm, halbs) in front of the lb, that
the seige onnies never got into range to
hit the lb; the result was that the lb
just murdered his seige onnies while the
onnies were trying to get close
(Probably he should killed the trrash
units first and gone for the lb later?)

ok if your killing someones siege onies
View     and winning it's simply because the other
Profile  person is not playing the siege civ right
like you said. some general info about
siege onies:

- all civs with siege onies have the +1
siege range and they all have siege rams
with the exception of teuts

so to counter all the siege you would
expect the brit to mass:

lbs, halbs, onies, trebs

so you would basically try and out micro
his seige and try to push extremely slowly
or just defend

but the thing is the siege onie player can
make an extremely strong army that makes
it basically impossible for the brit to
overcome

the trick is to not loose any onies due to
bad army skills, they need to be on stand
ground most of the time to ensure the lbs
come to you not the other way around.

so since we alrdy know all seige onie civs
have +1 seige, we can already assume the
way to push is with trebs, it becomes like
a castle blood, where the only purpose is
to kill castles while the other guys only
purpose is to defend his castles

but if the seige guys army is made of
halbs, skirms, onies, trebs and rams you
can already see why it would be hard for
brit to stop it, the seige users army only
purpose is to stand ground next to his
trebs, when enemie army comes defense
stance, but stand ground assures his army
does not get killed one by one and he
moves with his trebs, ensuring maximum
protection

sure the brit can try and mass trebs and
micro but the other guy can just send in a
few rams and onies and kill the trebs,
while brit on the other hand only has
trebs to fight trebs (lbs suck at killing
trebs)

the siege guy has trebs, rams and onies to
fight trebs, so in a treb war this is
already basically a 3:1 handicap

each castle that dies is a step closer to
death for the brit.

Finally i guess the conclusion i
personally have here is that the true
advantage that seige onie civs have vs a
civ like brits is not their siege onagers,
but their trebs.

Siege onies provide maximum defense for
trebs, and combined with other units they
are like a moving giant, so if your brit
vs a siege onie civ and the enemie is not
whoaring the trebs chances are you will
win Smiley

- Unless the other guy has a civ with rams
bonuses such as celts and mongols.

PS: Brit also has the +1 seige range
