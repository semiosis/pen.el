___________                          Hello guys. I'm on a vacation for 2 weeks. I was
Password                    View     hopin' to be able to do some games. I got the network
___________                 Profile  fixed at the place where I am now (ofcourse.. if not,
[ ] Remember me                      you wouldn't be readin' this).
[ Login ]
Lost Password?                       Anyways.. the proxy on the network is blocking me from
logging into Gameranger. I wonder if any of you fellas
Who's Online                       know how to fix it. The "can't find proxy" thing pops
up. I'd appreciate any help. Any ideas?

View Profile WWW     Hey buddy. Download a program called
Proxifier. You may be able to connect to
gameranger with that, although it might
not let you play games unless you can get
it to work for both gr and aoe at the same
time. If you absolutely must play, you
could do some research and get someone
back at your house to install squid proxy
one of their computers and set up port
forwarding to it on port 3128 both tcp and
udp. Then you can use a program called
corkscrew (installable via macports) to
make an ssh tunnel from your computer to
the one at home. You need to know how to
use ssh. Refer to this website:
http://www.mtu.net/~engstrom/ssh-proxy.php
. Assuming your interwebs is quite fast, u
should be able to play pretty well like
that. Good luck!

View     Ok Mantis. I've tried proxifier.. yet I'm no expert at
Profile  this. The problem is that I can't do anything with the
internet. The thing I need is something that fixes the
proxy. I've been searchin' alot now for different
solutions but never found. I downloaded proxifier, ran
it, and then tried opening gameranger, but still
didn't work. I guess I'll have to write in IP address
and port number?

Which address? And where do I find the port numbers
Smiley?
