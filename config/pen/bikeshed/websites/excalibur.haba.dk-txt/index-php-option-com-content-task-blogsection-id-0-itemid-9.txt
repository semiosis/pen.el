How can I get an avatar next to my comment?

Written by Administrator

A gravatar, or globally recognized avatar, is quite simply an 80x80
pixel avatar image that follows you from weblog to weblog appearing
beside your name when you comment on gravatar enabled sites.

How do I get a gravatar?
Signing up for a gravatar.com account is FREE, and all that's required
is your email address. Once you've signed up you can upload your
avatar image and soon after you'll start seeing it on gravatar enabled
weblogs!
