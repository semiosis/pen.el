Who's Online     WWW        Basically, the teams were L to R Homie,
shisno, fizzle, Triste  VS  subzero, dj,
We have 2 guests              leo, hermy.
online
spacer.png, 0 kB              homie killed subzero fast on a rush (homie
was korean) and went archer; then dj had to
take a double (and even a triple) for a
while; in pocket i made woads and rams
(celts) and with some help from hermy,
seiged triste, then fizzle, then eventually
shisno, and we won.

the reason i liked this game is because,
with ghost lake you are able to rush and
own if you are better than the enemy flank;
but yet you also tend to have games that
last late into imp, allowing full use of
the civ bonuses from later ages. 

I dunno, i think it's good for a few games
a week, what do u guys think?

my favorite maps, oasis is pretty cool as

only problem i'd have with the maps is
that they don't really have much gold Sad

View Profile WWW             yes i like this maps, cuz
gamecan go to the trading
age, and raiding those
trades makes game more
fun and complex overall
with the bridges and
stuff, strategic wall
etc, very fun game to
play sometimes.
