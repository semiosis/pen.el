 very easy.  You go to the control
Who's Online             page of your router (if that is also
your modem, see the asterisked line
We have 3 guests online    above) and set port forwarding.  This
spacer.png, 0 kB           means, you tell the router: ALL
TRAFFIC ENTERRING PORTS 16000 23978
AND 15000 MUST GO TO MY COMPUTER NOT
TO THE OTHER DEVICES.  unfortunately,
your router doesnt know english.  so
you have to put the info in like
this.  I will explain how to do it if
your router is an airport like i
have. 

 Go to the utilities folder in your
applications folder.  Open the program
called "airport utility" select the
airport that is your router or base
station.  click manual setup (if you
have leopard).  In any event, click
into the control page and if you are
on Tiger os you should have a pref
pane for port forwarding.  Enter the
ports above, and enter the IP adress:
10.0.1.9    If you have Snow Leopard
(and i think leopard too), then u have
to click the button up top that says
"internet" in teh airport utility
window.  click so the DHCP lease is
200 days.  you can do this with tiger
but its in another window or
something.  then click the advanced
wheel, then "port mapping" tab.  click
the plus button and type in 16000 in
both publick and private port areas,
and type in 10.01.9 for private IP
adress.  click ok.  Repeat this for
15000 and 23978.  then click update
for the airport, and you are SET!!!

 

ONLY ONE PROBLEM!! muahaha.  you just
forwarded all aoe games to 10.0.1.9. 
What if your computer is not called
10.0.1.9 on your own Local Area
Network (LAN, what your little network
of devices in your house is called). 
Well easy, we'll just change it to
that.

 

open your system preferences, and
click network.  This is a little
different depending on your OS, but
not too different.  In Snow Leopard,
you click advanced at the bottom then
click "tcp/ip", but in Tiger it is a
bit different.  Nonetheless you have
to find the tab that says "tcp/ip". 
write the following settings to look
like this:

 Configure IPv4: Manualy

IPv4 Adress:  10.0.1.9

Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.0

Router:  10.0.1.1

Configure IPv6:  Automatically

 

now click ok.  you are done! you did
it!!

 

*for my router, on Verizon, a westell
i think, i type in 192.168.1.1 into my
browser and it takes me to control
page.  I then go to
'FIREWALLSETTINGS"  I set it to
minimum security and i was fine.

 

ALSO in system preferenses, if you
have your Mac firewall on, you want to
go to the Security Pane in system
prefernces, clikc "firewall".  In
older os's, you can enter the ports
above, as exceptions.  In Snow
Leopard, you click advanced and
specifically add aoe and gameranger as
allowed traffic

 

PM me in GR with questions!
