View Profile WWW     Hey Pudding. I want to know more
about this too. On a completely
different note, I found a sweet
game I have to share with you
guys, if you haven't heard of it
already.
It's just like an open-source
clone of Age of Empires that's in
the making. Definitely cool.

Archers = No Bueno            Archers + Mac =
View     Muy Malo
Profile  They take too long to get out and anyone of
the same skill level will rape your team with
knights.
Just make knights with all civs like me and
learn how to transition out of them late
castle/early imp.  Even with Sarcans I mass
knights and usually transition into cavalry
archers.
Aztecs-fast imp or 15 30 castle and try to
kill enemy flank with quick eagles
Mayans-plums or fast imp or 1530 castle thing

Oh, and disregard anyone that comes in here
and says I'm wrong like leo is going to do.

Posts:     Boom is correct. Pocket. Archers are only
810        good in a game full of meds where you want
to look at their dumb massed pikes get shot
View       to death.  Don't make them in a good room.

View Profile Email       i think the only way u can
use archers as pocket is
fwding a monastery and being
mayans, that will mess the
enemys gold fast and he wont
be able to mass knigths and
kts he can do will be done by
monks.
it works even in good rooms.

I like rushing the pocket, especially if
both pockets close together cause you
can do some major damage. This is more
for the team cause your army will end up
getting killed most likely unless you vs
shit players, but you can really mess
someone's eco up while making your eco
the best. I honestly don't castle until
like 24 sometimes or later, and just
wall up at home. I really only do this
if I am brits, Japan, maybe saracen.
