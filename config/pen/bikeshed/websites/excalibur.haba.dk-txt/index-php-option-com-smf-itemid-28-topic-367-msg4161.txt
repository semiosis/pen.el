To leo, I thought I was the
nicest person on GR?

To plague, you have said this
very same thing of my
responses to you, where you
are glad it is only
Sinister_ROA making these
comments. YOU, however, seem
to be the only constant in
many of these arguments. Just
saying, I like banter back and
forth cause it stirs interest.

View     Mantis, oh honey, did I say
Profile  something to upset you?

Sinister, I have no idea what it is
you are attempting to provoke. Let
me say this though, I am well aware
you are not remiss in coming
forward if there is a chance of
having a feisty exchange with some
one. I have observed you on the odd
occasion revel in the banter with
other players on Gameranger.
However, I do not seek argument
with people for argument sake. It
interests me not. All I do is
facilitate people seeking the
assistance of a Good Samaritan like
me who are intent on making
themselves look more ridiculous
than they can possibly achieve by
their lonesome. It*s a service I
offer sparingly to the most needy
in our society.

If, you*ve noticed, I sway towards
more abstract concepts of logic.
You have quite a lucid mind. But,
you like to engage in arguments for
argument sake, whereas I don*t.
And, the themes of your arguments
are invariably motivated from a
central personal perspective,
whereas it is not with me. I am
just vitriolic when that occurs
because I find it tedious.  It is
never anything personal with me. It
has more to do with expediency with
me, and how fast I can extricate
myself from any given situation so
that I can return to the world of
blissful apathy, which I so much
prefer. You and I have a conflict
of styles and motivations. That is
my analysis. It*s nothing personal
of you.

View       Mantis, plague is nothing more
Profile    than an amusing troll. He is a
funny man with too much time on
his hands, and his "funniest
story" is about a person who is
not even in EX, so there's no
need to overreact (i.e. call for
his ban) - It's clear Leo is
actively moderating so nothing is
gonna get out of hand.

edit: someone correct me if I'm
wrong please.. I know I'm new
here

View     Mantis, I hope to goddamn fucking
Profile  Christ I never have the misfortune
of having someone like you rally to
my defence, either now or in the
next one hundred and fifty thousand
fucking years, or whatever the life
expectancy of human beings happens
to be these days.

In your now pitiful lameass attempt
of being a man of all seasons * as
opposed to the judge, jury and
executioner dude who we were all
recently so dearly fond of, and who
made the first post in this thread
using your non de plume  - you are
more personally insulting of
Vulture and Peitho than I ever
intended to be. Or would want to be
without provocation. You do both
Peitho and Vulture a great
disservice by the insinuations you
make in your remarks regarding
their personal resolve in being
able to shrug off a few mildly
unflattering comments that have
been made in this thread towards
them.

There is no imposition of any
compliance regime they need to meet
in assuring the members of Ex that
they are both doing fine and dandy
despite the occasional inclemency
of the weather which has prevailed
upon this now ill-fated voyage of
escalating tedium. Therefore, it
cannot be presumed of either of
them as to what their future plans
maybe based on nothing more than
simply being in absentia.

Both Peitho and Vulture are well
liked by many people in AOEII
playing community on Gameranger. It
is simply a preposterous
proposition of logic you propose
when you suggest either of them
would be influenced or governed in
their choice of associations by
anything written here. The only
thing that may be preventative of
Peitho coming back to Ex or
Gameranger is the fear of you
crawling up his goddamn ass when he
does return.

Mantis, please do us all a favour
and don*t speculate anymore on the
strength of characters of either
Vulture or Peitho. It causes me
great distress to observe my
adversaries, through no fault of
their own, having to endure such
cruel and unusual punishment.

Posts:     puds is around alot, mantis.  I
810        think he was sick recently. 

View       Yeh, mantis, you're right. 
Profile    Vulture and everyone else,
WWW        trained to join clan.  Vult didnt
train 1v1, but she trained her
team game and practiced her rush
and fc and took all advice
eaglerly. 

The shame about peitho is that he
would probably be better than all
of us, had he. 

Now, it is true that this is only
a game... but if i will be
playing a game, i want to play it
skillfully.  Even when i play
memory with my 4 yr old, i still
try to figure out the best system
(there is one!)

View     Wow.. What can I say.. I just read
Profile  through this (took me a while).

I've tried to analyze plague, and
why he's even bothering....

Question:
Why does plague even bother? (he's
not in our clan)

My answer:
plague and Peitho had a fight, what
would be the best way for plague to
strike Peitho? (raising everyone
else against Peitho).

plague is the kind of guy that can
make a hell big situation out of a
small problem, and if he can't do
it by himself, he will try to add
others to the group. It's a loosers
way of surviving the world, and I
think plague is a weak person.

Lately, I've played with plague. He
was a nice guy as long as I let him
do and say what the fuck he wanted.
Then there was this game, where
plague was my flank. His eco was a
mess.. and I moved into his base to
gather up and protect the spot. I
was hungering stone for castles for
my own base and plagues.

We won the game, and plague never
had to resign. Even by winning the
game, the first he said was "wtf
citin u stole my stone". And I was
like.. gosh! Is he even saying
that? His castle or my castle..
does it actually matter? I had
plenty of villagers available for
gathering the stone and he had only
a few ones chopping wood and
gathering food.

I hope you understand what I'm
trying to say, nothing is good
enough for him. If there's
something that could be criticized,
he'd be there to open. So.. In the
start of this thread, you all
turned yourself against Peitho. I
read how mantis and pudd actually
agreed with plague, and I think
it's lame.

Peitho is a really nice guy and a
good friend of mine, I've been
playing with him for a long time,
and I've never seen something bad
from him. First of all, Leo makes
the rules, not Peitho. Peitho was
offered to do 1v1 and by getting
better he would be accepted. He
didn't do as said, but instead took
on the tag without 1v1'ing..

But so fucking what? Do you plague,
have to be a total twat to him, and
humiliate him in any way (calling
him little Adrian just to make him
look childish and immature).

Plague, you're ridicolous, annoying
and weak in any way. That's all I
have to say.

So now.. I guess I'll have to wait
for a full screen essay filled with
words I'll never get to understand,
and quotes from books and stories.

View     Alright, yeah.
Profile
I believe we would something to
make EX grow... but I wonder.. is
there any clans that could be
considered a challenge? A lot of
the old and strong clans are now
dead, and AOC gameranger has gotten
parted.

EX is now for us a symbol of
teamwork, and some are probably
proud wearing the tag. But.. There
aint no longer the clan wars, and
L, E, <H> etc are all dead.

To your first topic, you shared
your thoughts, and I understand
that. But it's not your, nor
plagues place to talk (not on this
forum, and not on any forum). Such
opinions should be given to
Leonidas and not shared with the
entire AOC gameranger community.

I know plague, and how good he is
at causing problems, next time,
please don't answer his  topics..
maybe he's right, but he's not the
one to talk.

And Pudding, how can you seriously
whine about Peitho getting in too
easily? Afterall he never really
got in, did he? Not according to
Leonidas.

Mantis, leaving EX would be the
worst decision you could ever make.
Not because I would miss you (I'm
not saying I wouldn't), but then
plague would be the cause of it,
would you like that? I've never
liked plague, and I don't want him
to cause members leaving EX. But
I'm glad you didn't, that you
cleared your mind. Afterall, there
are good guys in EX

View     Plague... I find it quite funny how
Profile  you replied. First of all.. I
agree, I'm no good writer and
neither perfect or anywhere close
to it at writing english.

What you must take in mind is that
I'm Norwegian. Now.. let me see...
Let's take this discussion in
Norwegian language? Then I can
formulate my arguments just
perfect.. but first, you will have
to learn norwegian.. right? That
will take time, and you won't do it
perfectly. You see what I'm trying
to say?

I find it quite sad how you strike
me. You don't answer my questions
or thoughts. You rather try to
strike back by saying how bad I
write. Tells me how deep you've
sunk. You can't criticize our
game-play, cause you're far worse.

You're writing essays that I can't
fully understand, it's got nothing
with my mental age or maturity.
It's about learning a second
language, which I never will
accomplish perfectly. So how can
you say "its something they teach 9
year old kids". Well maybe in
countries influenced by english
language? Anyways, I can easily say
that I'm far wiser, smarter and
brighter than you.

This is no longer a discussion or
an argument. You write your essays
with quotes from books and stories,
just to make it look like there's
some sense in the dog food your
peddling.

As Vulture said, at the end of the
day.. it's all shit. I couldn't
agree more. So now.. let me see
some answers, maybe defend yourself
and answer instead of attacking
back, trying to hurt my feelings? I
feel sorry for you...

View     Author's Note: This post is out of
Profile  sequence. It should appear before
Citin's last post at #24

I faintly remember when this thread
began.  It was quite a popular
issue of interest back in its
heyday when it was topical and
there existed a semblance of
novelty, intrigue, amusement and
relevancy about it. But that was so
long ago.

As tangible a faux pas as dressing
up in a Halloween costume on
Christmas Day, there isn*t any
greater blunder anyone can make,
or, anything more absurd anyone
could be seen to be doing, than to
be seen continuing to discuss or
speculate about something in a
topical context or manner when it
is clearly evident time and events
have plainly moved on. It would be
akin to tuning in to your preferred
news service for the latest news
only to encounter the news
presenter discussing and
speculating about who is going to
win the 2008 US presidential
election between Barack Obama and
John McCain, or, a sports presenter
discussing and speculating on who
is more likely to win the 2010
Super Bowl between New Orleans and
Indianapolis. Few people ever make
this mistake because they know they
would look a complete and utter
fuckwit if they ever did. They
intuitively know they would be
dismissed out of hand by the vast
majority of people as being nothing
more than some ignorant fucking
retard. 

It would seem
Shalafi/Pioneer/Citin/Warhark or
whatever the asswipe wants to call
himself adds to topical discussions
in exactly the same way as he
assists his allies when playing
AOEII: absent at the start and
always fucking late in the end. And
though it is by no means
everything, a person*s ability to
utilise the English language in
literal discourse reveals quite a
lot about a person * even to the
untrained observer. I, therefore,
doubt very much it has escaped
anyone*s notice that Citin style of
written argument, is a style they
teach in school to nine year old
children in anticipation they will
one day advance to a more mature
style of written composition when
they are able to formulate the
argument they intend making in
their mind, as opposed to having to
detail the constructs of the
argument they intend to make at the
beginning of the composition, as
Citin has done. The practice of
asking oneself a question at the
start of a written composition and
then answering it is only ever
utilised as an assistive device for
both pupil as well as teacher. It
is designed to act as a reference
for inexperienced and undeveloped
minds struggling to come to grips
with the assignment they have been
set. It also facilitates in helping
the teacher understand the premise
of the argument the pupil was
intending to convey or attempting
to establish, especially if the
argument the pupil has made
contains too many irrelevancies or
is contrary to the facts. Needless
to say, this is precisely what
Citin has done.

I admit, it is very droll and
tedious of me to point out *looser*
is spelled loser and *ridicolous*
is spelled ridiculous, especially
when considering the train wreck of
a composition in which they appear.
I only do so because I am yet to
fathom how excruciatingly traumatic
it must be to wake up one morning
feeling happy and positive and in
good spirits, only to find out
later that Citin has publicly
claimed you to be a good friend of
his, as he has done to poor Peitho.
I thought I had seen the worst of
what could happen to Peitho when
Mantis decided to *defend* him, but
having Citin own you as a *good
friend* eclipses even that
diabolical fate.

Author*s Final Note: I am fully
aware and fully concur with the
decision to lock this thread. It
was a decision arrived at by mutual
agreement as the thread is no
longer topical and/or serves any
beneficial purpose.
