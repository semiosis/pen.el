Wololo                       U say that u did so great beating me and
Triste, with that u asume that Triste is
mgalvezcendegui@hotmail.com  like me, link and taa, but at same time u
View Profile WWW             say that triste at 150% cant even hold
link... you are sad if ur trying to look
like superpowerful that game in that triste
(low skilled player) played still worse
than normal.

If i wanted i could ve had all my army
together and have made 5 mangonels befor
link came i had like 1500 of eachr esource,
so me and triste played really bad vs the
best u can ask to taa and link (coz taa i
so proud of him and link to have played
soooooooo well heh)....
