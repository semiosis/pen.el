Introduction o Registering o Logging In o Profile o Posting o Personal
Message o Searching

So you've arrived at this Simple Machines Forum (SMF)! Perhaps you've been
looking at the board index or a screen telling you that you need to
register before you can read it and you're wondering what to do next?

Well, some forums permit guests to read and post, some permit guests to
read only and some are restricted to registered members. We'd recommend
registering at any forum that you see yourself using regularly because
many of the most useful features will only become available to you when
you do so. Since SMF, however, is such a flexible system that few forums
are likely to be identical, we will start by describing four key areas
that we'd normally expect to be there for you:

 1. The Main Menu
 2. The Board Index
 3. The Message Index
 4. The Topic

The Main Menu

Supposing you've arrived here as a guest (or have registered but are
currently logged out), the main menu (which appears on every page) should
normally comprise five or six buttons (or text links):

o Home, which takes you back to the board index.
o Help, which brings you to this guide.
o Search, which allows you to search the forums for whatever you're
looking for.
o Calendar, which links to the forum calendar (if enabled).
o Login, which allows you to login if already registered.
o Register, which allows you to register (or sometimes apply for
registration) when you wish to do so.

Once you've registered and logged in, however, the main menu should look a
little different:

o Home (as before).
o Help (as before).
o Search (as before).
o Profile, which allows you to make changes to your profile settings.
o Calendar (as before).
o Logout, which allows you to logout again if desired.

Forum administrators should also note the presence of an additional Admin
button.

The Board Index

While the board index (forum home page) is packed with all kinds of
information and links, the core of the interface (at least in the SMF
default theme) normally looks something like this:

+  Forum Name

-  Category Name
New                                                     Date, time,
Posts  Board Name         Number of topics and posts in  subject and
Board Description           this board            author of last
post

  New Posts  No New Posts                      Mark ALL messages as read

o The forum name links back to the top of the board index.
o If the category is collapsible (shown by the little arrow symbol),
clicking the category name collapses or expands the category as
appropriate.
o The board name links to the message index for that board.
o The board description describes the board's content, and may also
include links to child boards and/or specify the board's moderator(s).
o The New Posts and No New Posts icons in the leftmost column show
registered members whether there have been any new posts to the board
since they last read it.
o The Mark as Read button enables registered members to mark all posts
in the entire forum as 'read'.

The Message Index

Like the board index, the message index interface is quite straightforward
when reduced to its essential components:

+  Forum Name
|- +  Category Name
| |- +  Board Name

Pages: [1]       Mark Read Notify of Replies Start new topic Post New Poll

replies)

o Some forums show the navigation tree at the top in a space-saving
horizontal mode.
o The page numbers link to further pages of the board, and may be
accompanied by Go Up and Go Down buttons linking to the top and bottom
of the current page.
o The Mark as Read button enables registered members to mark all posts
in this board as 'read'.
o The Notify button enables registered members to subscribe to email
notification of replies to topics in this board.
o The New Topic and New Poll buttons are for starting new topics and
polls, as described in the posting help.
o The Subject, Started by, Replies, Views and Last post links enable you
to sort the columns by these parameters (with Last post also toggling
between descending and ascending order as indicated by the little
arrow).
o The topic icons in the leftmost column are explained by the key below.
o The post icons in the next column are sometimes used to draw attention
to the mood or purpose of the topic.
o The topic subject links to the start of the topic, with extra links
for subsequent pages and new buttons to take registered members
straight to their first unread post of the topic.
o Where the topic has been started or last replied to by a registered
member, their names link to their respective profiles.
o The Jump to menu provides a convenient quick method of navigating the
forum.

The Topic

Sometimes referred to as threads, topics are where you find the actual
messages:

+  Forum Name
|- +  Category Name
| |- +  Board Name
| | |- +  Topic Subject
