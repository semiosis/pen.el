View        Hey, wtf!!!!
Profile
We all know that TAA is a talker, but we love him anyway.
It's like a family, there's always those that we wish
weren't a member, unfortunately we have to deal with them,
and we like it. Nothing in the past matters. Top 10 is
always changing. But what we have to go on is the fact that
the top ten at the current time, are the elite. Just because
you were there once, doesn't mean you are there now. Leo,
when will you be there? Get your facts straight before you
make stupid remarks. I was tops in rm and dm at one time.
That was when I spent 12-24 hours per day playing this game.
i'll never be there again..and that's ok with me. Have fun
with the time you have. Kill as many noobs as you can, and
hope to last as long as you can vs the great ones of the
time. Fuck it!! Live it. Love it. BTW, I'm drunk, and my
post is probably long past where the current discussion is.
Uh....asdf

* * * * *   All i know is that Thai was the nicest guy when i met him on
Posts: 566  GR, th en a bunch of people started showing off with words,
saying they were so good when in fact they should be showing
View        it with winning.  So i have no problem with Thai putting

WWW
Hood, TAKE IT OUTSIDE rofl... play thai and see what
happens.

constellation of H, if thai was on the team...

not gona go and rub it in his face. Its a game and i have
fun playing it.

So really thai i have nothign against u, i like u when u
