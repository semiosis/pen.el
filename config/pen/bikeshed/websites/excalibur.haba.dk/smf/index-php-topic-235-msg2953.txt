oh please go ahead, its rare that i find someone able to
View        flame me intellectually rather than just, "yaya but YOU
Profile     SUCK!!! OMG! RAHRARHAR! you dont even play anymore!"

its hard to find interest in posts like that

View        he he Mr taa, I fear that your distinction between yourself
Profile     and your actions (in this case: your flames) might be, as
WWW         you english people say, "irrelevant". Is indeed a simple
being something different from the summa of all his
predicates? Even if something like a pure subjacent
substrate of the TAA exists, as we can't have any
acquaintance to it, we henceforth will continue to flame
your phenomenal manifestations, i.e. your own flames, by
Jove.

meh Tongue

Wololo                       ok, here i go (TAA: ''go ahead'').
TAA said: BB dont play anymore cuz im not
mgalvezcendegui@hotmail.com  trying in GR, no chalenges.
View Profile WWW             But yesterday BB said: ''No time to play
nowdays''
 
Hmm i was also thinking in flaming you
sbout that I ve beated you 4 of 6 last
games we had, but you will say:
''That I have beated you twice without even
trying and by reflect means that players in
GR sux''

Hmm... lets see what happens xD.

When i stopped playing i said i had no time for it also, but
View        then again back then, i tried not to tell people the truth
Profile     to keep their self esteem up. Now i dont care.

and as far as our games go, i played a completely different
strategy (not a vill order change or anything small like
that, but a completely different strategy, advance times,
units made, attack times and strategy completely different
from one to the next, most of which i made up as i went
along) in every single one of those six games, as you saw,
(further emphasizing how little i try) and then the next
point i would make was the one would predicted i would, so..
yeah i wont say it, but yeah, if i can beat you two out of 6
playing 6 different strategies, think if i was to stick to
one, and play it even 5 times a day for a week? :p

not really, i would just be the best at one strategy rather
View        than very several, and i'd still be the same level of good
Profile     at the others, because i would play them the same amount,
that amount being never.
