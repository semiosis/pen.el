i just wanna have clans wars!!!!  and a active counter for EX
and Epitadeius said  tek is active and shisno, and it is true but, it
would be rreally hard  EX vs  Aztek,  cus he is the only active member
clan of Lxg, and sometimes i have seen shisno and shift as a miracle.

in E would be fun Eisen, limes, py-an and Bozoo or brigthblade or limes
vs EX   but it would be unfair any way.

and in H  i dont know much people but i have played good games with
redburn and others i dont remember.

it will be unfair a RM and nomad with Leo, thai, ottomato, haba, hermy
or me  in one same team against an active clan right now  Grin
