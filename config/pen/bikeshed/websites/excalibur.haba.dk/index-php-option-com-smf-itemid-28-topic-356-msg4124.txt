Hi There.
Rugan ?
Im making this post to some ppl
View     that want to learn how to play dm,
Profile  well I can see that their biggest
problem is that they start making
dumb things like spearmans with
turks xd for e.g.

No problem... i will say what unit
make with each civ, lets start:

Aztecs: with aztecs you can rush if
you are flan with eagles, aztecs
have the good adventage that their
infantry are stronger thatn the
other, +4 strong...
What you gotta do with aztecs is to
make halbs and archers (if you are
vs paladins), eagles and archers
(if you are vs halbs for example)
or the strongs aztecs champs and
archers if your vs mmm idk
anything.
What you gotta remember is No
champs if you are vs Paladins. No
archers if you are vs skirms. No
halbs if you are vs champs.
With aztecs the sigue is important,
massing onnies and rams is good.
you can start a late econ cause the
are cheaps, rememer to seel extra
resources.

Britons: With britons is great to
mass longbows and halbs or champs
(depend what you are fighting)
Dont make the shitty cavs of brits
cause it sucks.
The eco of brits its a lot of wood
regular food and gold
For attack is important make trebs
and some onnies if you want, they
are good vs infantry.

Bizantines: With bizantines lot of
people make the error to mass
pals.  Thats wrong,  cuz if you are
in a battle vs spanish or franks
pals, you lose cause biz pals just
have 160 hp and others have 180 and
192.
With Biz you gotta start making
some camels, then make archers that
are good, and infantry.  Cats are
pretty good if you combinate them
with halbs or champs.
In the siegue make rams and onnies.

Celts: Great civ. For ignorants
players Celts has best sigue in the
game, and that is a great
adventage... Celts has weak pals,
same as bizantines, so make
infantry, halbs or champs and
archers. With celts you have the
option of massing onnies or
scorps.  Scorps in masse are great,
but you gotta combinate a little of
all and remember to make lor of
rams, also take lot of wood

Chinese: Chinese start with 5
vills, that is a big advantage, you
can rush easily, 4 make stable 1
make houses, once stables are done
make CAMELS not cavs cause they
sux. Chinese has lot of tecnology,
so once you make the stables you
can make barracks and mass halbs,
champs or both.
its not necesary to make arbalest,
cause you can make "Chu Ko Nu".
make lot of bombard towers and
chinese siegue good too, so make
rams and scorps and win.

Franks: Excelent civ, start making
ton of paladins, franks pals have
192 hp, so they own other pals.
once you make around 6 stables make
8 barracks with champs, halbs or
both. Once that is done make lot of
castles, and lot of throwing
axemen. if you are vs infantry t
make onnies is good too. franks
doesnt have good rams so make trebs

Goths: Rusher civ. To rush is easy.
1 vill to houses 2 make barracks.
when barracks are done make 15
huskarls, they just take some
seconds to create and they are
fast. Make around 10 barracks. Goth
infantry is great and very cheap.
when you are rushing send all units
to vills. and when he has no vills
he is dead...
Also you can mix infantry with
scorps

Huns: Also rusher civ, huns are
great and to use them is veery
easy, 3 viils make 3 stables, once
they are done make 15 pals, and
more stable. Use gather point, send
pals automatically to your enemy
base and start killing villies.
once you have 6 stables make 7
archery rangs and make tons of cav
archers. You should kill your enemy
easy. Also make rams and thats all

Japanese: This is a little weak
civ. What dont have to make is
cavs. Start making infantry, the
make lot of archers and skirms,
samurais are good vs special units,
not vs pals or champs. Make sams if
you are vs mangs, cats, mamelukes
or throwin axemen. Otherwise is not
very good to make them.
what is very important its to mass
trebs. Japs trebs pack and unpack
ver fast, use them strategically vs
siegue and units too.

Koreans: Gret civ, start making
barracks and halbs or champs. Then
make inmidiatlyu castles, lot of
castles, when they are ready ultra
mass war wagons, after that make
siegue and lottt of onnies. Also
you can make bombard towers. With
this civs is very important to take
a lot of wood

Mayans: Is important that if you
are flank make a rush with eagles.
With mayans you gotta make halbs if
you are vs pals, if you are vs
arrows make eagles that are strong
vs them. Make lot of siegue, scorps
and rams. And is also important to
make lot of plumed archer

Mongols: Start making camels and
then change it to hussars, mongols
hussars are good cause they have
118 hp. After that make lot of
mangudais that are great, and mix
them with rams that are very fast
with mongs. So your troops gotta be
mixes of rams hussars and
mangudais. (You need lot of wood)

Persians: start making camels or
paladins, both are good. Next to
that make 6 castles and full them
of eles, inmidiatly make 6 barracks
and make scorps and rams. You gotta
make your eco very fast, pers is a
very expensive civ, start making
farms right next when you finish
making the eles. Elephants are very
powrful unit so you gotta make lot
of them and you win.

Saracens: Sarcs has 160 hp camels,
and that win vs franks pal and
obiusly comon pals, what is great.
So start making stables and lot of
cames cause they are really good.
Mameluke is a great unit too, but
very expensive, they cost 85 gold
so start taking gold fast as you
can. Make rams and onnies if you
want and thats all.

Spanish: Is a very easy civ to use
and very good. Start making stables
and pals, then make barracks and
make some halbs and champs and
after that make castles and lot of
conqs. Finally make siegue workshop
and create rams. If you make this
plus a good economy you will own
with this strategy

Teutons: good civ. Make paladins
skirms and teutonic knights,
teutknight are only weak vs arrows
so skirms win arrows same as
paladins, if you make that you
should win, i dont use to make bomb
towers with teuts, but if you want
to go on. Teutonic Knights are
expensive in food so make farms
early.

Turks: Turks are good but very
dificult to use. Start making
camels, then make castles and
siegue workshops. Mass jannisaris
and cannoners, the problem is that
ther are weak vs pals and turks
doesnt have halbs, they have
spearmans !!. so what you gotta
make that is not easy is to protect
them with bombard towers, lot of
bombard towers cannoners and
jannisaries own. Every thing of
this is very expensive, so make
good trade.

Vikings: Weak civ, start making
champs and pikes, the make lottt of
arbalest, next to that, build some
castles and make siegue workshops,
berserkers are not very good but
make them anyways, and in the
siegue workshop make scorpions and
rams

I hoping you improve with this long
post... see you in GR

nah some problems some overlap
with my ideas as well, here is
best army in general for each
civ ( doesn't work for every
match)

Aztec- they suck but eco is
good so you gotta take control
of map. Use ram and onager
alot, their eagles pretty much
suck but they are decent for
raiding.

Brits- LBs, some hals not too
many, and treb. Brits are
great equalizer, you arent
going to get anywhere with
them but they are also tough
to beat.

Byz- another civ I hate,
usually I build cats/hals/rams
and if i really want to be
annoying I start bombard
towering all over the place.
In general not a great civ but
can dominate a few (goth for
starters).

Celt- Awesome civ, start with
rax and get hals going and
then workshops. Army is any
combination of
hals/woads/onager/ram/scorps.
Massed scorps are my favorite.

Chinese- I dont make camel, I
make cav at start. Only hope
in 1v1 for china is to get
control of the map. They
cannot beat any civ with
decent siege unless you have a
good rush. I start with six
villagers on one house very
quickly and then you peel one
villager off at a time as
quick as you can onto
stables/rangers. I start with
cav and cav archer with
forward workshop and towers.

Frank- Mass paladins at the
start. After I make fifth or
sixth stable I do aggressive
forward castle cause axeman
are so good. Clearly one of
the best civs.

Goth- Very difficult civ, but
you cannot be discouraged by
losing guys at the start. I
usually am down in score by
about 2000, but thats ok. Just
forward their main gold and
hopefully another pile with
four to five castles while you
send endless huskarls after
house villagers.  They are
very good in 1v1 vs most civs
cause you can get control of
map. Goodluck in team game,
they suck after the first
three minutes.

Hun- Easy start, I make three
stable, fourth villager out
outlines five more
stables/ranges depending on
whether you want paladin heavy
or CA heavy. The outlines of
the buildings will be next to
the other buildings, so one
for each stable being built
and then two more right next
to tc, waypoint your next
villager on the last tc and
make sure your first three
villagers move to seperate
stables after completing the
original three. This is best
because adding additional
villagers to buildings is
slower per villager (although
sometimes you need to finish
one building quick , not the
case with hun).  Army is CA,
Paladin, RAM, hal.

Japan - Sucks, hals/sams and
trebs for the most part.
Goodluck.

Korea- Massed wagons, hals,
onager, treb. Very hard to
stop. Must be quick at start
with barracks.

Maya- awesome civ. Extra
villager makes things quicker,
eagles are very good with
plummed support. Rush for
first 5 minutes of the game
and make market at beginning
and sell wood and food. Make
eagles rams hals plummed.
Another civ where oyu can get
control of map, eagles are
awesome raiders with no cheap
counter so alot of times in
1v1 i set wp on gold stacks.

Mongol- dont build barracks.
after first five minutes stop
building camel. Switch to
mangudai, ram, hussar. Pretty
much all you need unless
against heavy paladin. Also
throw in some onager.

Persia- Clump, build castles
in order so that villagers
cannot be hit. Only build
outlines partially of each
caslte. start food eco early,
i usually only make
eles/rams/scorps.

Saracen- I make camel only for
short period, I usually clump
with saracen with one stable
in the mix. Great army, get
maxed out on mamelukes,
hussar, ram, onager. Kills
pretty much everything.

Spain- GOod team civ, pretty
good 1v1. Very fast but also
expensive. Paladin, conq, ram,
hal is good army.

Tuets- Paladin rush with heavy
forward, good castles so i do
offensive clump with castles
and treb.

Turk- check opponents civ, if
its a civ that starts with rax
try to do hussar rush with
btower and jan forwards.
hussar only to annoy and get
villager. DONT DO THIS IF THEY
HAVE PALADINS OR CAMEL, you
will die really quick. If that
is the case, playing boring
bombard turk. with rush good
army is jans, hussar, ram,
bombard cannon/tower.

Viks - clump if you are
against frank or hun in 1v1,
if not then you can beat some
civ with treb/siege war... you
are gonna die no matter what
vs hun or frank clump just
gives you more time to think
about it. Team game, Ram,
scorp, arb and berzerk is not
bad.

Lots of Overlap with GK, but I
think I avoid infantry more
than him and use ram with
every civ/play a little more
aggressive.
