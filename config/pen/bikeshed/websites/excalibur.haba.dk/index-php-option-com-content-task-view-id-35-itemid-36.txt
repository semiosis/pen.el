Who's Online    4 Sheep: Once you have found them,
send two Sheep to the TC, and send
We have 2 guests  the other two Sheep scouting,
online            helping the Scout (you are not
spacer.png, 0 kB  going to lose your sheep, trust
me) in opposite directions (for
example, if your Scout has gone
north-east, send one Sheep around
north-west, and the other
south-west). The other two Sheep
are to be placed directly onto
your TC; one Sheep will be
processed by your three Vils (get
them to dump off their wood first
if they had chopped a straggler),
and the other will stand by
waiting.
Vils 4-6: Sheep. Whenever a Sheep
is done, move another Sheep nearby
it. Keep only six Vils to one
Sheep, make sure that you do not
kill an extra Sheep. Always only
keep two Sheep on the TC; one
being harvested, and the other,
alive, standing by. All the others
can either be scouting or standing
by close to your TC, but not close
enough so that your Vils on Sheep
might decide to eat two Sheep at
once, but also not far enough to
have your Sheep stolen by your
opponent.
Vil 7: Lumber Camp. A Flusher
needs wood. If you have not
scouted out a suitable forest yet,
put this Vil on a straggler
instead so that no time is wasted.
Vils 8-10: If you do not have an
LC yet, get Vil 8 building it. If
you do, send all of these 3 Vils
to the forest at your LC.
Vil 11: After he has been trained,
hit Loom, and get the Vil to wait
by a Boar. When the Loom is 80%
done, lure the Boar.
Vil 12: Mill your Berries (you
will need that Mill for Farms).
Vils 13-14 Go to Berries along
with Vil 12 after the Mill is
done, and keep them on the Berries
closest to your Mill.
Boar: When the Boar is chasing
your Vil back to your TC, garrison
your lurer, and get all the Vils
on Sheep to drop off their food,
and then shoot the crap out of
that Boar. That bastard needs to
die. Plus, for being barbaric, you
get good, fast food. If you have a
Sheep left over rotting away, it
might be a good idea to put one
Vil on that Sheep until it is
done, and then send him back to
Boar.
Vils 15-19: Boar. Once your first
Boar hits 175 food, lure your
second Boar with a full health
Hunter on your first Boar (drop
off his food at your TC first, in
case he dies).
Farms: At this point you should
consider Farming. Pull the wounded
Vils off your first Boar, and make
Farms by the right-hand side of
your TC. Tests have shown that
Farms put on the right-hand side
of your TC actually gather food
faster. Slowly pull off the
wounded Vils off the second Boar
as well (so you should have four
wounded Vils in total from both
Boar) and put them on Farms as
well.
Boar: Once you have finished your
Boar, split up your Hunters onto
Sheep.
Vil 20: Build a second LC by
another forest if your first
forest is small, or on the same
forest is large (but place the LC
farther away so that both LCs are
not touching each other).
Vils 21-23: Wood right by the
second LC.

The easiest way to remember this
build order is basically
6-4-1-3-5-4. 6 on Sheep, 4 on
wood, 1 to lure, 3 on Berries, 5
on Boar, 4 on wood.

Now, garrison all your food Vils
around your TC (Sheep, Boar,
Farms) so that they drop off all
their food. If you have 500, hit
Feudal. Then press "W" (default
hotkey) to send them back to work
(your Vils will go back to what
they were doing automatically).

Move all your previous Boar Vils
to wood, except for a couple. If
you still have Sheep left over,
use two or three Vils (that were
previously the Boar Hunters) to
harvest them. If you plan to play
defensively, send the first couple
of Vils I talked about to make a
Rax facing towards your enemy. If
you plan to play more aggressively
(more micromanagement intensive,
as well), take four Vils and send
them towards your enemy, building
your Rax closer to him.

Once you hit Feudal (11:xx
minutes), queue up two Vils at the
TC (and keep the production up
100%; Vils before military, until
you research Wheelbarrow when you
get enough food), research
Double-Bit Axe (faster wood; you
might not need any more Vils on
wood, unless your wood Vils die to
enemy units), make two Spears at
your Barracks, and if you played
defensively, with the two Vils
that made your Barracks, get each
of them starting on a Range. If
you were forward building, get two
Vils to start a Range each with
your four forward Vils.

Make Spears, Skirms, and Vils all
the time. Send your new Vils to
food (some on Berries, but most on
new Farms), unless you need wood,
in which case, send them to wood
for a bit. When you have enough
wood, get a Blacksmith (for
Fletching and other upgrades).
Make a Stable ASAP, and get a few
Scouts. When you are done your
Berries (with six Vils at around
the 15:xx minute mark), send those
Berrie Vils to your gold (make a
Mining Camp if you have not
already started mining gold). Get
Bloodlines when you have enough
gold. When the gold is coming in,
move to Archer production from
your Ranges instead of Skirms.

Once you get enough units (around
10 Skirms, 2-3 Spears), start
harrassing his wood, and if he is
mining gold or stone, stop him
from doing so.

Continue to make Vils, and
research Wheelbarrow when you have
enough food after all your other
units (Scouts, Spears, Archers)
have been queued up (always queue
up two units). It is a tech that
is insanely good for Farming. If
wood permits, add one or two more
Stables in Feudal. Castle when you
have enough food as well (but
always keep queueing up Vils and
military units). Before you
Castle, put your newly-made Vils
on gold (you might need a new
Mining Camp, even if it is on the
same gold pile; put the Camp at
the other side of it so that Vils
do not have to bump into each
other or walk long distances back
to the first Camp); you will be
needing lots of gold in
preparation for Castle. During the
Feudal/Castle transition, try to
build more Stables so that your
total Stable count is three or
four. Research cavalry techs at
the Blacksmith (Scale Barding
Armour, Forging).
