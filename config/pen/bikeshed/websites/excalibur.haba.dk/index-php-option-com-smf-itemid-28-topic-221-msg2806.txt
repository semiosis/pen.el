Who's Online                                  are wasting time.

We have 2 guests                                When i created }{I) i did
online                                          it for the sake of making
spacer.png, 0 kB                                a clan myself, now my
interest is that GR
becomes more competitive
again, hard thing with
the low amount of players
that are in GR.

Here is the real
situation in GR:

-Right now L for me is
better than H, but they
are in diferent
timezones, so donesn't
even have sense discusing
wich clan is better.

-H is good clan in the
sense that theyr players
have lot of talent and
were by far the strongest
clan in 2004 and 2005,
but i don't like how they
will never recognise how
good L have became.

-EX is in hard situation
since there is not
interest from part of
some members, thats just
a luck of that this is a
game and ppl is free to
leave it whenever they
want. I didn't like the
flames that were born
after we beat a
decreasing H and upload
the recs.

The action should be more
playing and less posting,
thats the GR i would
like, and for the ones
who like to remember or
show how good theyr clan
got it is legitim to
upload the victorys or
best games they had, and
every clan is free to do
it.

View     Gone for 6 months, and sadly my name never
Profile  gets mentioned anymore. Nice to see the same
old flames going though. Btw Dragon, an odd
win doesn't mean you are top 5, as i've
beaten imac, syko, DJ, park, thai, bert,
chino, trapt etc in 1v1's (some of them on
numerous occasions), but would not be vain
enough to think that makes me better. It just
means i had a perfect game and out manouvred
them on occasions.
To be honest, i've never ever lost to mal in
1v1, so i'm surprised his name would even be
considered up there. The more you try
proclaim your greatness, the more you sound
like you are trying to convince ppl, so it is
better to just let your consistent gaming do
the talking. After a while, ppl will
recognise it (it took a long while for ppl to
recognise homie or TAA, and they were
consistently beating the best). Having said
that, i'm sure i'd get owned in 1v1 if i was
to come back with any consistency.
Anyway, hi to everyone else. Sorry haven't
been around at all, but big changes happening
at home with our first child on the way. So
work, and some more studies, are taking up
the majority of my time!

Profile     lol leo ... it's cus taa needs it duh ! if
we don't call him elite who will ? :p

and lmao, homie just named him his top 5
... you weren't in it ... and you are
stilllllllll trying to make out that it's
just arrogant H arguing with you ... dude
if u haven't noticed everyone who isn't in
your clan is telling you're not "elite"
and your not "top 5".

if you wanna go ahead and prove that we
(everyone who isn't in ex) are actually
wrong  then go ahead, beat elites, beat
who we rate better then you in our top 5.

this is just tiring repeating the same
point. you aren't in my timezone so how do
u know i'm less active ?

You know what? save your breathe dragon
because i don't care what u have to say
anymore, since you are obviously NOT going
to prove me wrong, but talk talk talk ...
and then talk some more about how good you
are.

and I have actually admitted L are better
then H atm, hell H don't have a fouth
player really Shocked
oh and get over those recording already
imac! if u are that annoyed about them...
delete them

good to see ya shaggy

View Profile WWW             Park your post is totally
out, im far from crying
for that recs, you just
replied to my post cuz
relying, there was
nothing actually to reply
about my post since
everything i wrote there
is true, but seems that
you feel offended or want
to keep the flame alive
since you needing it so
much. Btw TAA posted a
list with him in the top,
i found that arrogant or
a joke in best of the
cases.
