Well I almost never do M@a unless I'm
We have 1 guest       View       japs/goths so I don't remember the vill
online                Profile    order. The goal of the M@a is to have
spacer.png, 0 kB                 3-4 m@a +1 scout on your flank soon as
you feudal. You'll hit him the same time
he feudals probably. Hit whatever is
most vulnerable. Since you're there as
he feudals you should be able to stop
your flank from putting up his
archeries/stable w/e he's going, hit his
gold if he's mining. I like to stay away
from wood because a smart player will
kill your army with his wood vills/tc.
Basically what you're doing is messing
him up and buying time for you to castle
and KH or xbow him. Oh I'm dark btw.

Posts:     well in the maa rush that's rec'd
607        basically what i do is go 6 sheep 1 wood
4 berries then rest wood except i add
View       one more to boar, for total 7 on boar. 
Profile    and i hit feudal button i think with 23
WWW        vils tho i can do it with 22 to 24 vils,
coz if wood is running good, i go one
extra to boar for earlier feudal time.

I start barracks b4 i hit feudal button
and i make 2 or 3 militia in transition,
which i send with my scout to harrass
but not die til i get maa up. then the
rest u can see in the game, either do
maa fc or archer up then fc 23-5 min

Posts:     the vil order isnt important after a
607        certain skill order, i do this with a
dozen different ones and same result. 
View       this particular order seems to work well
Profile    in laggy games.
WWW
Anyway, TAA, do u mean u invented the
archer after teh maa, or the fc after
maa?  I think you invented the maa fc,
at least i believe i can remember
exactly when it was first done and how
shocked people were when t hey were hit
by maa, then suddenly you were castle!

In any event, I have a rec of bert
killing homie with maa (on flank) then
more or less rapidly castling, even if
not a formal maa fc.   This is quite an
old game, at bert's absolute peak in
play; you were berts pocket btw, and
chino was homie's pocket.  All of my maa
attacks are modelled after bert's,
simply because for whatever reason i had
a few recs of him obliterating me using
that strat, so i had personal experience
of how to mess someone up, plus a rec of
him doing it

View        good to see your still an idiot, saying
Profile     m@a is old is like saying using knights
during a game, or making villagers in a
game is old, of course it is, people
have been doing it since the game was
released...

i created/popularised m@a fc on mac,
and to an extent archers, although that
was more down to the input of bert than
myself, he suggested the move after
watching one of my games, and we both
started to develop the strategy,
although at the time we had no use for
it since everyone bar big boss sucked
so it was unnecessary.

Posts:     that's interesting taa.  the first time
607        i ever actually saw the maa archer was
in a 2v2 where bert was my ally, and he
View       did brutal maa on shaggy, then archers. 
Profile    poor shaggy was waylaid.   this must
WWW        have been 2 or 3 years ago, coz i still
barely knew how to flush back then.
