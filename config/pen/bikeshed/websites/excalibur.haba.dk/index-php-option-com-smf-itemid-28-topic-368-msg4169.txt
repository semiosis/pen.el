View       Definitely glad to finally be a
Profile    part of it.

I've improved my game a whole lot
this summer with the help of leo
and others and I want to keep
improving. I'm always looking for
constructive advice. I'll see
everyone around!

View     Nice! Welcome Kash & Hello!
Profile
Hello:
I'm not quite sure if you remember
me.. but we used to play a lot of
DM ( I guess I'm the only DM'er
left in EX now).

Kash:
I don't think I know you or heard
about you before.. I might be wrong
( I was gone for 5 months). Lookin'
forward to play with you! Smiley

View     Yes I remember. Ah the good old
Profile  days of GR. I have considered

times just to consistently get
games.

I think the combination of you
being in the army and me being at
the naval academy (we cant use
macs here wtf) means we wont be
meeting up much on gr, but yea
before this summer I was quite
the noob hehe. How is it for you
playing after so long off?
