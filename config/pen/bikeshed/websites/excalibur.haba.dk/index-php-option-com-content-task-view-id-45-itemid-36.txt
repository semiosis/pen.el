Ways to be fast:
spacer.png, 0 kB                       -Use hotkeys!
-Have all the hotkeys set
on one side of the
keyboard so you only need
one hand to press all of
them.
-Build no more than one
square away from your
towncenter when you
begin.
-Use the shift key! It
queues units 5 at a time.

How to start a game of
DM:

First things first, you
start out with a town
center and 3 villagers
and a scout. We will use
vikings as an example.

1. Queue your towncenter
to 15 villagers by
pressing shift CCC.

2. Two villagers start
making your military
buildings. To maximize
your speed, make the
villagers build the
building directly below
where they're standing so
they won't have to walk
anywhere. In the case of
the vikings, those two
buildings would be
barracks. Side note:
(Buildings should be
built 1 square away from
towncenter, doing so will
help a lot in stopping
rushes. And DON'T build
them AGAINST the TC or
you won't be able to move
around as easily.)

3. The other villager you
have will build a house,
make sure it's very close
to where the villager was
standing.

4. Send the scout to the
enemy base and attempt to
kill atleast one
villager. (The enemy base
can be found by looking
for bushes on the
mini-map.) Since the
enemy will probably do
the same, the best thing
to do with the scouted
villager is to garrison
it into your towncenter.)

5. Send the first
villager that comes out
of the towncenter to help
build houses. The best
way to do this is to
build a house and hold
shift and click like
crazy in the back of your
base so they will be busy
for a while. (DO NOT do
something gay like
building the houses in a
perfect rectangle or
along the edge of the
map, it takes time and
it's unnecessary.)

RECAP: By now, about a
minute has passed. So far
you've queued up your TC
to 15 villies, made 2
villagers each build a
barracks, the other a
house. You've sent the
scout to the enemy base,
and the first villager
has come out of your
towncenter to help build
houses. Moving on...

6. At this point, the
barracks are still in the
process of being built.
While they are being
built you can wait around
or you can do something
useful like controlling
that scout you ordered to
the enemy base to kill a
villager. Once you hear
the noise of the barracks
being finished, switch
back to view your base.

7. Now you have 2
barracks, and possibly
the next villager just
came out of your
towncenter. (Let me say
something here, the
mistake that I see a lot
of people make is that
they make too few
military buildings, you
will need much more than
two obviously... You will
need like 20+.)

8. In a RING around your
base, build 5-6 more
barracks (be careful not
to put all of the
barracks against
eachother) so you will
have a total of 7-8
barracks once they are
all done. The two
barracks that were just
built should have 15
champs queued into them
each with a gather point
set out front (gather
point should be in the
same place)

9. It is best to do steps
6-8 as fast as you can.
Once done with step 8,
select the towncenter and
put the gather point on
an unbuilt building so
the villager that comes
out will go right to
building it.

Another side note:
Another mistake that I've
seen people make is that
someone selects all of
their villagers to build
ONE building, then the
next, then the next. THIS
IS WRONG! One villager
per building (unless it's
a castle, but we're not
there yet).

RECAP: Now you have two
Barracks building 15
champs each with a common
gather point in front,
you also have 5-7 unbuilt
barrack sites in a ring
around your towncenter.
You are constantly
switching the gather
point of the TOWNCENTER
to build an unbuilt
building, as well as
ordering existing
villagers who GET DONE
building a building to a
new one with no villagers
on it. Also, as EACH
barracks pops up, you are
queueing TEN, thats right
TEN, champions and
setting the gather point
of it at the same spot as
you set the first two.
(Around 40 seconds to 1
minute has passed since
the first recap. ) You
will also want to check
if the two villagers are
able to keep up with the
population you're
producing, if not, then
it is ok to have an
existing villager
transfer to building
houses.

 Once you have many
villagers each building
their own barracks, where
do you send the next
villagers? Eco? To build
castles? None of these,
now is the time to start
building the next ring of
military buildings,
Archery ranges.

10. The building of the
first ring and the second
ring may overlap quite a
bit, but for the sake of
learning, lets pretend
they don't. The next ring
will consist of archery
range, all making
arabelests. The archery
ranges that you will be
making should be no more
than 1 square distance
away from the first ring
and should cover the
single spaced gaps of the
first ring as well. Looks
something like this:
Second ring:      --- 
 ---   ---   ---   ---
First ring:             
---   ---   ---   ---
Towncenter:           
 ------------

11. Also with the archery
ranges (7-8), as each one
pops up queue TEN
arabelests and set the
gather point at the same
place you're gathering
all the champs. Since you
probably have MORE than
enough villagers for each
one to build their own
archery range, make the
rest of the villagers
each build their own
siege workshop from which
you will produce
rams(which will be queued
at 5 each and, like the
archery range and
barracks, have the same
gather point as them)
Scorpions are great to
throw in there to if
you're facing an infantry
civ.

12. Any extra villagers,
have them build a few
castles out in front or
on the side, but not too
far away from the main
base! It is ok to have
more than one villager
building a castle, I
usually put four on a
castle.

13. When buildings start
popping up, send them to
start your eco. Standard
eco is 30 villagers on
each resource. There
should be 3 gold mines
close to your base, as
your villagers finish
their buildings, pick
them off one or two at a
time to build a
towncenter next to a gold
mine, until you have one
TC next to each of your 3
gold mines. As each TC
pops up, queue in 10
villagers and set the
gather point on the gold.

14. Once gold villies are
set on their TC's, start
doing food. You can do
this in many different
ways, but I prefer to put
3 towncenters in a spread
out triangle. While
they're building I mass
farms around the
towncenters so I can set
the gather point on the
unbuilt farms. Ten
villagers each by the
way.

15. Wood is next, and it
is done pretty much the
same way. You place 3
towncenters close to wood
and set the gather points
on the wood. Very
straight forward.

So now you have an army
that consists equally of
champions, arabelests and
siege rams. DON'T EVER
build armies of single
types of units, you will
want multiple types of
units in your army, ours
consists of siege,
archers and infantry, for
example. Also, select
units to fight together,
don't select ALL of your
champions, then select
ALL of your archers and
have them fight
separately. I had you
guys put all the same
gather point for a reason
and that's so you can
select a box of units and
it will have some
archers, champs and rams
in it.

Now you're ready to start
attacking, even though
you could've multi-tasked
and fought while you were
starting eco, but
fighting will be another
guide. Thanks for
reading!
