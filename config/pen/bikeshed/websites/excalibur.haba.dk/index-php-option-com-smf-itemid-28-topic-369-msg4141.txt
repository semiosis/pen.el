i steal sheeps
since game allows
me to do it, war is
war...

for people who dont
like be robbed i
advice them to
create a new map to
punish those
people. like in CBA
when u delete gates
u get booted of the
game, in this they
must be booted if
they steal sheeps.

remember sheeps are
economy thing and
economy is part or
ur whole strategy
in the game.

so dont drop if
someone called
berrakito beraka or
octopus do it.
