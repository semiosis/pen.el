Posts:     Guys, these are some points about how i've
Login Form       511        noticed flank strats (as played by the top
10-20 players atm) have evolved recently. 
Username           View       Tell me what you think.
___________        Profile
Password           WWW        Well about a year or so ago, we saw the
___________                   arrival in force the strat of the flank
[ ] Remember me               gettin lots of archers with spear/ arch and
[ Login ]                     a good build to defend the base, with a
Lost Password?                forward army to coordinate with a fast KH
from pocket; the double would roll many
Who's Online                flanks. 

We have 2 guests              Over time, i noticed this strat get more
online                        and more common, until it seemed that it
spacer.png, 0 kB              was the top strat used, at least in the
games i saw/ was in. 

To summarize, brutal doubling of flank with
archers and knights, attack with these b4
20 min, was what was becomming more common
in my experience.

NOW, i've noticed something new, in several
games (coincidence? chance? new trend?). 
what i noticed is that an opposing flank
that used to be very aggressive on me with
archers, was holding back his army,
defending more and booming more. 

Is this coz we been hit and brutalized so
bad on flank, that when we have an
opportunity to attack and double our enemy,
we are more prone to be defensive??? and
then we dont double IE doubles are dying
down again coz the top flanks are scared
into defending themselves so that they in
turn can handle double?Huh

im not sure... what do u think, any of u
guys notice this??

i've noticed in a few games i've done flanks
View     simply massing in their bases. Pretty soon
Profile  it'll get to the point where I'll just castle
on them while they hold their army back, so
its cool.

View     most people hardly know how to mass archers
Profile  quick and right, they also dont know how to
attack right with them, they are afraid that
sending small groups is a bad idea, it might
be a popular strat but less than 3 people can
do it decent, some ppl can manage to get an
army but then they castle too late and die, a
reason for this increased defense is because
most KH'ers are starting to get defense upgs
earlier and are actially cordinating their
attacks with there allies...

i dont think flank can still be judged though
since not many people are
offensive/proficient enough... but overtime
kh's will loose alot of power, due to the new
strat im developin, hehe  Tongue

Posts:     KH's have already lost a ton of their
511        power, in most goods games i play.  I dont
even bother with regular 17 min KH anymore
View       unless my flank is like top 5 player; coz i
Profile    cant do enough damage myself anymore, and
WWW        my flank has been holding back and not
helpin me enough

as for flank, really people dont realize
that if u do ur build right, it's a 1v1 for
18 min max only, then if u are aggressive
on enemy base, the fight is at their
doorstep and it's 2v1 there.  if u sit and
defend, it's 2v1 vs u coz they come.

a good example was yesterday, i had shisno
enemy flank and his pocket was legend.  I
was stupid spanish flank vs shisno's turks
arrg.  so i made maa (but my stupid spear
got lost so what i wanted to be 3 maa and 1
spear rush ended up being 3 maa and a spear
that was wandering around) and i got a good
first hit, i coulda easily maa fc if that
was what i wanted coz his scouts were way
late and i had some spears in my base
anyway.  Instead tho, i massed skirms and
spears (no archers); i got no pocket help
coz he messed up at first.  Anyway, i got a
weak double team that died like at 28 min
lol; that set me back quite a bit but after
that the flank just never put anymore
pressure on me, AT ALL he just defended. 
Since i was castle and had knights, i sent
my knights to the enemy pocket at the same
time as my pocket sent his xbows there; we
doubled the POCKET and as a result won the
game.

That's just one example of what i mean,
where we won the game just coz we were more
aggressive; being flank like shis was,
massin then not hitting is just something
new but i think it is wrong...

View     That game seems very familiar to me vs you on
Profile  flank leo, just i played it better  Shocked

You did 3 maa and a spear vs my 6-8 scouts
and we both fced.  Just you had aztek (i
think) pocket so i had to defend the whole
game.  I made xbows/pikes with one tc and
just waited for our team to win.  In this
case however i attacked with small cavalry
raids to be annoying.  Grin

View     Well I actually almost died because my pocket
Profile  was too slow.  I am not saying his name, i'll
tell you in GR.  But aztek was 2 mins faster
than him and you two doubled me and i didn't
have spears. so i laid low untill 28 mins
when i started raiding you again.  at 30 the
other side won and i was starting to win my
side cause aztek had to help your other side.
