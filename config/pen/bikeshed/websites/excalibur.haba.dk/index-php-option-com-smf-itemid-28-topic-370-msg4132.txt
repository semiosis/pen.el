Who's Online              View       So we all know that we can improve our
Profile    AoE skill with practice, but I think
We have 2 guests online                there's the misconception that we are
spacer.png, 0 kB                       limited by how fast we can click
without losing accuracy.

Fear not! Just like you can train your
free throw, you can train your mouse
accuracy as well. There is an excellent
game at missionred.com to help you do
just that.

So try out
http://missionred.com/games/reflex.html
and see how high you score. To set a
low low standard, in 5 games this
morning (its 7am) I wasn't able to
score higher than 220,000. I think that
a good goal is to try to get up to
300,000 (or 400 for overachievers), and
see if we can improve our game. If not,
at least there's finally something to
do when you really don't want to play
another CBA.

View       I admit, the real point of this is for
Profile    everyone to share their high score! Oh
I just scored 75,000 with my trackpad.
No wonder I'm 3x worse on this than
with a mouse. (Remember you lose 4,000
if you misclick)
