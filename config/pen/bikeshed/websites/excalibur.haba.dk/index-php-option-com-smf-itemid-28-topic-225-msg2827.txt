Posts:     well i played a 3v3 yesterday that really
Username            511        impressed me because it was a quality game
___________                    all around, but with players that a few

[ ] Remember me     WWW
[ Login ]                      Teams were L to R leonidas, dragon, haba
Lost Password?                 VS. clal2kjoy, zoze, Legend

Who's Online                 basically, on the left i was chinese with
a decent time, and i tried to maa archer
We have 2 guests               dj, but he was huns and was too fast, i
online                         got to his base just as he was finishing
spacer.png, 0 kB               his archeries, and had to run away, and he
got a bigger skirm/spear army and i had to
go back and defend while i built my army
and got the upgrades early (since i was
chinese)

I dont know about haba vs. legenda, but
legend had a higher score early on,
whatever that means.

then at early castle (18-20 min) both
pockets knight hoarded, and i know that
both of our flanks were losing on our
side.  Dragon came and after some bad
instances of teamwork (due to lag), we
coordinated and my archers/spears got the
zoze KH, and his knights got the dj
skirms, and i was given breathing space to
castle and boom while i built up xbows and
pikes.  several dj and zoze raids were
unsuccessful.

I know from what i heard that on other
side, dragon killed like 40 legend vils,
so that after that haba (poor guy was
spanish flank) was winning.

In imp, dragon started to lose to zoze,
but didnt matter coz haba finished legend;
and on my side, i beat dj (he made hca and
cav and seige rams; i had tons of
buildings forward with onnies and arbs
hidden in between where u couldnt get to
them, and halbs in front).  my arbs micro
on his hca and cav, and halbs protected;
onnies murdered the rams and the hca;
trebs too, so dj gg'd it.

In summary, i think this was good coz
people didnt really mess up, nice strats
were used, ima look if rec'd.  I think we
won coz of a mistake by zoze:

zoze was pocket, both his flanks were
winning.  he shoulda just kh'd dragon hard
in his base and kept dragon from saving
his flanks, then game is won. 

so game was high quality and hinged on
strategy, not coz some player sucked or
didnt know how to kh or know how to rush,
etc...  good stuff...

View     Yes, we won cause zoze is too dumb-headed 
Profile  Shocked to realize with the KH that you
don't have to hit the flank. Huh You need to
be flexible in games. Cool
