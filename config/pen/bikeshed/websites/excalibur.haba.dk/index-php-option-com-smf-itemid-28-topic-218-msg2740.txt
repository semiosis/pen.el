Wololo
We have 2                                    I agree with bert.

kB                                           long for some recognition,
and also you need to begin
giving good matchs to homie,
aztek or park. Btw i tought
chino was considered elite,
so why dragon not?, but as
now chino isnt elite then
dragon not.

But rekogniton is nothing
compared with the flavor of
the victory against players
like taa, park or aztek
Tongue, we obviously play
games to beat challenging
players.

People know who the 'elite' are, if you need
View       to scream at people that you're elite you
Profile    aren't I'd say. You probably have to have at
WWW        least beaten an elite or two, even if they
were having an off game. You need to start
having people scream "split park/homie/etc and
dragon" at the start of team games because
they know its game over if you're on the same
team..
yes and only 3-4 people who ever play on my
time zone lately are ever considered to be a
fair split to homie or aztec or park or taa or
imac (hint) without a further handicap, so
therefore they are the top class.

the next group all get split amongst
themselves, including me, dj, chino, mal,
dragon, etc.

then is everyone else, like snake, zoze, etc
