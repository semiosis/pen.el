As you're doing this, the best thing to do is to follow up with rams and
to build a forward base which comes next.

-----------------Forwards-----------------

The purpose of a forward is to maximize your speed. What it is, is a
mini-base with all the buildings you need so you can just produce your
army at your forward base instead of at the main base and having them run
half-way across the map just to get to the battle.

"A U.S. strategic concept which calls for containing or repulsing
military aggression as close to the original line of contact as possible
so as to defend the entire territory of a nation or alliance."

What does a forward consist of?

The forward consists of a few castles and protection buildings (bombard
towers) and around 3 or 4 siege workshops. Those are the ESSENTIALS.

The rest of your forward (the military buildings) are decided by what civ
you have. For example, with the spanish civ, you might put a few stables
in your forward to keep a good supply of paladins quickly.

----------------PATROLLING-----------------

According to clal2kjoy, whether or not somebody knows how to patrol is
essentially the borderline between a med and a good. SO LISTEN UP ITS
OBVIOUSLY IMPORTANT.

It's very hard to describe this, so I'm gonna try my best. Most people
think its just a little command that makes your unit/s walk back and
forth, but its NOT! So anyway, here it goes. Have you ever sent your
units to go attack the enemy, but they all died on their way to battle
because they were too busy walking? Patrolling is the way around this,
basically what is does, is that is has the army attack anything on it's
way to the destination that you specify. For instance, if you patrolled
20 champs to the other side of the map, and there happened to be a couple
halbs in the way, your champs would kill them off, then continue moving
to their destination instead of ignoring them and taking damage while
they're walking.

Patrolling rams works wonders by the way.

Ok so now you know what patrolling is. How do you do it?

Select some units and press the patrol button (or Z is the hotkey) and
send it to some point PAST the enemy buildings/units that you want to
take out. If you don't patrol PAST the enemy, your units will only go to
the point you specified, then turn around and go the other way.

So not only is a patrolling a better way to attack, the units that are
patrolling also have a faster attack rate! (Thanks Hello)

----------------- FLANKS -------------------

A flank is the right or left side of a military formation. In a game of
1v1, the battle does not, in fact, hardly ever takes place in the middle
only.

A flank is just another forward, that isn't at the forward, it is built
at the right or the left, enabling you the ability to attack from more
than just one point.

The purpose of a flank is to:

- Distract enemy units from their forward base, giving you an opportunity
to strike while they are weak.
- Create more opportunities to attack the enemies eco, or make it more
easily accessible.
- Confuse newer players because defending against 3 well managed
forwards(flanks) is very intimidating and confusing to someone
unprepared.
- To be a dick.

-------------------------Raiding--------------------

Raiding is a tactic used by players who want to get rid of, or weaken,
the enemies eco substantially. OR to decoy the enemies main army.

Raiding is fairly simple and is almost always done with a type of unit
that won't get owned by a towncenter will villagers garrisoned inside
them. I would say paladins, eagle warriors, cav archers.

Send maybe like 10-15 units to enemy gold spots and take out all of their
gold villagers is what I try to do, same goes for wood, food, stone. At
the same time, you're also forcing the enemy to take units from their
main army to go suppress your raid.

Probably the most fun way to raid an opponent is in a team game with cav
archers, or some type of archer. In DM team games you will always need
trade, and positioning the archers directly in the trade route will
pretty much take out all of their trade carts forcing them to make more
carts AND respond to the raid itself.

-------------------MAP CONTROL-----------------

Map control is less about having the majority of the map and more about
controlling key points--areas where there is a lot of gold and pathways
(usually created by trees) to attack or defend. back routes which can be
used to attack trade should also be defended properly.
