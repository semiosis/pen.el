Password?                  this was around the time AK had been ended and i started playing
rm with homie we got along well cuz we liked the same music and
Who's                    pretty much found similarities in school stuff, homie atm was in ?
Online                   which was practically iddle in USA hours so he was basicly alone,
after some games he joined L.
We have 2
guests online              at this time L was known for az and chino but when homie joined it
spacer.png, 0              was az homie chino we had gotten another very good player, for
kB                         some time everything whent the same we began to change when we
entered the H's clan private forum, we had been pretty cool with
most Hs until we saw their private forums which had a mess of
topics aimed agaisnt L, homie and aztek so we where pretty much
pissed because we thout we where getting along pretty well but
after seeign all that trash talking we really disliked those H's
and thats when the whole rivalry began...

for a long time there was non-stop flaming on the L forums, H vs L
ect, it made the Legacy forums of then the most used clan forums
at the time the whole GR rm community used those forums, we had
alot of crazy games vs H back then it was fun because they where
still pretty active and still had some of their strong players.

eventually after bert iddling the flaming calmed down, L was once
again at a new level of skill and those left behind where seen as
dragging the clan down, so another clan attempt was made called
MYst, it failed because all its members basicly whent iddle which
was about 5 people, in less than two weeks L was brought back...

Then pretty much L has just been playing while other clans have
been iddling and loosing peeps, so during all this time we where
the ones changing how rm was played and such, finally summer of 06
H tried to make a comeback even getting back old members such as
bert, aksarben and mooby but it appeared too much time had gone by
team rm was pretty changed now at this time L basicly depended on
homie and aztek because chino was iddle, but it was still enough
to beat H and gain recognition from most as beign the strongest RM
clan...

Since, L hasnt had to worry about any other clans really, not much
competition in the clan world, with H no longer a seen as a threat
we could relax with our sweet spot on the RM clan list Smiley

summer 07 has come and pretty much gone, nothing new, L still top
but now we have a much more deadly team and an improved depth with
players like chino, malicious, marcus, redcoat and boom...

i really hope that next summer a clan can attempt to bring us
down, because we miss those nice cb's

Here is a list of the players who have added a bit of their own
Legacy to our clan:

AzTeK, Chino, Homie, BoomBox, Malicious, Marcus, Paracite,
Vermeer, Shift, Py-an, redcoat, mouldy, flames, adrian, giovanni,
spinach, lordarka, chitumin, snake, clueless, morena, tarlo,
jaguar, vincent, trinity, hotdog, sheep rusher, bobgap, inviz,
shisno, legend, pat, death, hoopdreams, linkmaster, midas(zoze),
red october, slick, triplez, bozoo... prob forgot some

k thats it for now

Uhm if I recall correctly you used the L forum virtually as a
password database by using your admin powers to change people's
emails and then email yourself their details. You then told me
about this by bragging that you had Shaggy's HD forum details.
Most of the flames started after that. I'm not sure about trash
talk, I'm sure there was some, but hell I was -this close- to just
opening the whole thing up to the public after I'd stopped
playing. There is nothing in there that I think people would
particularly care about.
Let me put it this way, I had to delete threads about people
occasionally before I gave them access after the same people
'trashing' them voted for them to join the clan.. so I guess it
can't be too significant. Screenshots of people losing were often
posted, the only difference between us and other clans in this
regard was I preferred to post them in private forums.

As for me coming back, it was just a bit of fun really..
personally I thought I was starting to hit my straps before I had
about 2 weeks where I had 6 computer programming pracs due, then I
didn't want to be near a computer for a while.. Most of my
problems were with scouting in Dark Age, which is a ludicrous
thing to be having problems with - but can really screw you over,
lead to some extremely good games and some extremely poor ones.
Lets face it I practically hadn't played in 2 years and in my last
year of playing I was only playing enough to stay in practise, my
peak was way back in 03 in terms of speed, idles.. etc. Experience
wasn't there then though.

About Emperors history.
View
Profile  2003-2004: foundation and progress.
WWW
The clan has been founded in 2003 by Hannibal, Hades and Orin, but
this last one quickly disappeared in July 2003. At this time were
recruited many mainstays of the clan, like skater, py-an, limes,
corto maltese and atom. Then Job and Albertus Magnus, both from SPQR,
joined the clan. On Hades and Job's impulse, the clan started to be
competitive.
A new stage was reached in Jan. 2004 when some recent players joined:
the big boss, who was already pretty skilful, le_paladin, who was at
this time a very strong player, then a little bit later
Denz/Yosemite, Henchmann, BrightBlade, Fanch, Ultra, Geo.
This sudden flow of players had been hard to manage: for there was a
gap, in terms of level, inside the clan itself, the best members of E
decided to split and to become "Ti" (Titans) after Schiggy, who was
an annoying rook, joined the clan. But it doesn't last long: Schiggy
was booted and E started again, but it has been a hot spot.
With 2 leaders, the clan was now able to rivalize with the best
clans. The rivalry with H born.

Sept. 2004 - Jan 2006: the "double-headed eagle's period".

This was the real peak, in terms of level and activity, of the clan,
inspite of Hannibal stopping to play and Paladin and Corto leaving
the clan. E had the best player of 1v1 and the 2 best teamplayers. E
and H were dominating GR, and it would be very hard to say which one
of them had the supremacy. Bert and BigBoss were semi-regularly
playing in 1v1 (before bert preogressively stopped AoE) and some good
games E vs H have been played.
However, the weaknesses of the clan were: only one elite player (BB)
for 1v1 (Hades dislike it), a restricted group of active members, and
no experience (except for bb and hades) at DM.
Then joined: Eisenschmerz, le_fol, mirodin, Zumbi and Tristelune.

Since around March 2006: the decline

Then E had suddenly to face a big problem: Job (March) then Hades
(May) stopped playing and basicly disappeared from GR. As they were
both the "backbone" of the clan, this one became a bit unstructured
and demotivated. Solid players were however recruited, like beeraka
and bozoo.
Even if BigBoss confirmed his supremacy in 1v1 through the ladder,
nonetheless, the fact is that E, with a lot of iddle players, is now
not really competitive for clan matches while were merging current
2006 2 new powerful teams (EX and L) which both made up new styles,
tactics and strats.

Argh!

[PS: sorry for all of them that I might have forgotten and who had a
role. I tryed to be objective but people could disagree, if case tell
it. For more details about the first period that I did not really
know,you can go there:

View        Some games have been recorded but posted I don't know; I got a BB
Profile     Hades vs Bert Qiyamat ; Imac (half-E) Paladin BB vs Mooby Qiyamat
WWW         Boneyard; Bert Taa Jonny vs BB Skater Corto (this one was on
ancient E website)... and the unique 1v1RM BB-Hades too (2004),
like a fight for leadership, that Hades won.

 I could do a "vintage section" in my website if you wish but
these games from the "pik-skirm era" could seem today a bit
old-fashionned, not to say boring.
