whats a good start for
nomad?

i always do 4 on sheeps
and 8 on wood to hold the
producing of vills and
fish boats early

and then rest on food with
boars and deers or
fishing,  around 30 , then
8 on gold.

some simple but it works
for make knigths with 3
stables sontinusly

pls give ur opinion and
order.
