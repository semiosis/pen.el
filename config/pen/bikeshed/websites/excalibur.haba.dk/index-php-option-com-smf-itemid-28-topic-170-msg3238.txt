Posts: 607    lol yeah welcome back.. Imac, i posted that 2v2 we played in rec games coz u did
a nice plain spear skirm rush, and that's so rare to get someone who does that
View Profile  and does it well anymore, but it is a good rush.
WWW
Also, We had an awesome 4v4 yesterday, I gotta post the game, i dunno how we did
it but we won, Big slick Aztec, Schmuck, and leonidas (L to right) vs dj, rola,
Legend, and boombox.

basically, i messed up early feudal and boom was doing fine vs me, and in castle
i felt we were even and i could hold my side.  But then i got carto.  I 
realized that although Aztec had beaten dj mostly, EVERY ENEMY was attacking
aztec lol he was fighting a 4v1 lol, and holding even.  and we were down like
10,000 to 9,000 or something; and the enemy were imping first, much faster than
us.

then suddenly, boombox made a big mistake vs me.  He was teuts and made
palladins without a halb counter; and i was jap and massed usual halbs (50 of
them lol) and arbs and trebs, and his base just died so fast; i dunno if anyone
helped me or what else happened, i wasnt watching, but we somehow won lol.  It
is the biggest come back victory i ever had, i thought there was no chance to
win...

View Profile  Leo, the newest rec you added "4v4 goodz" is not the game you described, it is
actually me, dol, ultra, and imac vs muxa, plague, you, and legend.
