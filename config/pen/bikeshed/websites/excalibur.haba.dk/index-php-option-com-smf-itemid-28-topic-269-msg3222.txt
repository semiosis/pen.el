View     it's the same as when the 10.0.5 update
Profile  came out, no rec that was recorded before
10.0.5 will work, so now that 10.0.6 is
out no rec that was recorded on 10.0.5
will work.

607        a nice solution to this is to have a
version of aoe in a different folder,
View       that you only update to 1.0.5 (you can
Profile    probably get the older update from
WWW        version tracker; in my case, i have it
on my older mac, and i might have the
older update somewhere to add to this
site if there is a lot of demand).

We should probably bundle all the old
recs into an "antique rec" folder and
make some new good ones.  It would be a
real shame tho, coz you lose so much
tradition.... and knowledge of the
masters!

Profile  How do you get by an older version of AoE
II if you've lost your installation cd
and you have already upgraded to 1.0.6,
which is the case for me?

First post btw Smiley, glad to see good
work is being done on the forum
