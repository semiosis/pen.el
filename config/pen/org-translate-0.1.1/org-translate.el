;;; Commentary:

;; This library contains the `org-translate-mode' minor mode to be
;; used on top of Org, providing translation-related functionality.
;; It is not a full-fledged CAT tool.  It essentially does two things:
;; manages segmentation correspondences between the source text and
;; the translation, and manages a glossary which can be used for
;; automatic term translation, displaying previous usages, etc.

;; Buffer setup:

;; The mode currently assumes a single file holding a single
;; translation project, with three separate top-level headings for
;; source text, translation, and glossary (other headings will be
;; ignored).  The three customization options
;; `ogt-default-source-locator', `ogt-default-translation-locator' and
;; `ogt-default-glossary-locator' can be used to tell the mode which
;; heading is which; by default it expects a buffer that looks like
;; this:

;; * Le Rouge et le Noir                                     :source:
;;   La petite ville de Verrières peut passer pour...

;; * The Red and the Black                              :translation:
;;   The small town of Verrieres may be regarded...

;; * Glossary
;; ** ville de Verrières

;; In other words, tags are used to find the source and translation
;; texts, while the glossary heading is just called "Glossary".  This
;; is also configurable on a per-project basis, using the
;; `ogt-translation-projects' option.

;; Segmentation

;; The first time you start this mode in a new translation project
;; buffer (after first setting up the three headings appropriately),
;; the mode will detect that the project has not yet been segmented,
;; and will offer to do so.  Segmentation involves inserting the value
;; of `ogt-segmentation-character' at intervals in the source text.
;; As you progress through the translation, you'll insert that same
;; character at corresponding places in the translation text, allowing
;; the minor mode to keep track of which segment corresponds to which,
;; and to keep the display of source and translation synchronized.

;; The option `ogt-segmentation-strategy' determines how the source
;; text is segmented.  Currently the options are to segment by
;; sentence, by paragraph, or by regular expression.  Note that, after
;; initial segmentation, the minor mode will leave the segmentation
;; characters alone, and you're free to insert, delete or move them as
;; needed.

;; As you reach the end of each translation segment, use "C-M-n"
;; (`ogt-new-segment') to insert a segmentation character and start a
;; new segment.  The character should be inserted at the _beginning_
;; of the new segment, not at the end of the last -- eg at the start
;; of a paragraph or sentence.

;; Use "C-M-f" and "C-M-b" to move forward and backward in the
;; translation text by segment.  This will allow the minor mode to
;; keep the corresponding source segment in view.  Alternately, move
;; point however you like in the translation text, then use "C-M-t" to
;; update the source view.

;; The glossary

;; This mode also maintains a glossary of translation terms for the
;; current project.  Currently it does this by keeping each term as a
;; subheading under the top-level glossary heading.  Each subheading
;; has an ID property, and this property is used to create links in
;; the source and translation text, pointing to the glossary item in
;; question.  The mode keeps tracks of the various ways you've
;; translated a term previously, and offers these for completion on
;; inserting a new translation.

;; To create a new glossary term, use "C-M-y".  If you've marked text
;; in the source buffer, this will become the new term, otherwise
;; you'll be prompted to enter the string.  This command will attempt
;; to turn all instances of this term in the source text into a link.

;; In the translation text, use "C-M-;"
;; (`ogt-insert-glossary-translation') to add a translation.  The mode
;; will attempt to guess which term you're adding, and suggest
;; previous translations for that term.  If you don't want it to
;; guess, use a prefix argument to be prompted.

;; Bookmarks

;; The functions `ogt-start-translating' and `ogt-stop-translating'
;; can be used to start and stop a translation session.  The first use
;; of the latter command will save the project in your bookmarks file,
;; after which `ogt-start-translating' will offer the project to work
;; on.

;; TODO:

;; - Generalize the code to work in text-mode as well as Org,
;;   using 2C-mode instead of Org subtrees.
;; - Support multi-file translation projects.
;; - Import/export TMX translation databases.
;; - Provide for other glossary backends: eieio-persistent, xml,
;;   sqlite, etc.
;; - Do this by allowing the glossary locator to point at a named Org
;;   table, or at a babel source block, allowing users to maintain
;;   the glossary outside of Org altogether.
;; - Provide integration with `org-clock': set a custom property on a
;;   TODO heading indicating that it represents a translation project.
;;   Clocking in both starts the clock, and sets up the translation
;;   buffers.  Something like that.
