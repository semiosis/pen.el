Dear Heavenly Father, Jehovah God,
I need freedom from a spirit which has been:

- lip biting me
- tonguing me

Dear Heavenly Father, Jehovah God,
I do not understand why You have allowed an evil spirit
to touch my genitals and my mouth, but please deliver me from it.
LORD God, I do understand why You allow me to receive dreams and visions
of young women and children.
Please, LORD God, deliver me from evil spirits.
Please, LORD God, deliver me.
LORD God, please help me.

Dear Heavenly Father, Jehovah God,
please free me from anything to do with Melee
in Jesus Christ's name.
Whatever is not from faith is sin, and I do not have faith to pursue Melee.
Because I haven't heard any endorsement towards it, I simply want to be freed from everything concerning Melee, and free to move on.
Yet I have no desire except for what is carnal to marry anyone else.
It's beyond repair I think.
I'm not going to marry someone if I do not love them.
I'm not going to marry someone if I feel like doing so will send me to hell.
I'm not going to marry someone unless You, God, endorse it.
Please let me move on, God, without being affected by anything to do with her.
I want a new life again.
The one You gave me got trainwrecked, I think.
I need to hear Your voice, God.
It's essential to hear Your voice, God, not an optional extra.
Please, God, I'm aware of things like the Word for Today, and a word of knowledge through Danny, and such things being quite likely coming from You.
However, I need to hear Your voice directly regarding this, not through the grapevine.
Please let me hear Your voice concerning this.
Also, please clean me.
I'm sick of questioning things such as 'maybe this spirit spouse touching my lips and loins is Melee.'
It doesn't feel right.
It doesn't feel holy.
Please clean me God.
Please also let me hear Your voice.
Please push away the evil dreams and spiritual harassment and lead me into safety.
In Jesus Christ's name I ask,
AMEN!!
