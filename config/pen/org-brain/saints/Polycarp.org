In the Martyrdom, polycarp is recorded as
saying on the day of his death: "eighty and
six years i have served him, and he has done
me no wrong." this could indicate either that
he was then eighty-six years old[16] or that
he had lived eighty-six years after his
conversion.[3] polycarp goes on to say: "how
then can i blaspheme my king and savior?

you threaten me with a fire that burns for a
season, and after a little while is quenched;
but you are ignorant of the fire of
everlasting punishment that is prepared for
the wicked."[13] polycarp was burned at the
stake and pierced with a spear for refusing to
burn incense to the roman emperor.[17] on his
farewell, he said: "i bless you, father, for
judging me worthy of this hour, so that in the
company of the martyrs i may share the cup of
christ."[13]
