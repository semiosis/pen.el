God is Amazing

My name is Allan Levi. My wife Ariana and I have 4 
children. I am a qualified decorator with my own 
business.  

My parents split  up  when I was  one.  I remember 
seeing my dad twice when I was little.  

I was raised in the Waikato until I was seven, when 
my  family  moved  in  with  my  Mum's  Uncle  and 
Auntie in Lower Hutt.  

After moving there, I started 
going to work with her uncle. 
The first time he took me to 
work  he  began  sexually 
abusing  me.  The  abuse 
continued for years before  I 
gained the courage to speak 
up. It was embarrassing, and

relationships.  I  didn’t  view 
them as father figures. They 
were  certainly  not 
role 
models.  

At  13  my  little  brother  was 
born,  requiring  most  of  my 
Mum’s attention.  

With less attention I became 
more independent. In my first year at college I felt 
broken  and  lonely,  trying  to  deal  with  what  had 
happened to me. 

I turned to cigarettes, marijuana and alcohol. By 14 
I  had  basically  stopped  going  to  school.  Mind 
altering substances sent me further off track.  

At 15, I was sent to my nana and given 3 choices: 
school, course or a job.  

I was too young for a job, so I started a carpentry 
course and gained work experience building.  

Next, I worked at a holiday park for 2 years before 
being made redundant.  

I  then  started  my  painting  and  decorating 
apprenticeship.  I  went  to  Christchurch  after  the 
earthquakes in 2011 to help 
with  the  rebuild.  I  was 
drinking, 
taking 
ecstasy,  was  still  smoking  a 
lot  of  marijuana  and  began 
smoking

methamphetamine.  

After  the  rebuild,  I  moved 
back  to  the  Waikato  and 
continued 
my 
apprenticeship  while  still 
heavily  using  mind-altering 
substances.  

At  19  I  was  at  my  auntie's 
house  when  her  friend's 
niece  arrived  to  drop  off 
some  methamphetamine.  I 
couldn’t  even  look  at  her,  I 
was  too  shy.  She  was  a 
dealer, and I was an addict. A 
few  days  later  I  texted  her 

and we decided to meet.  

Six  months  later  I  proposed.  I  was  drinking  less, 
taking  ecstasy  and  smoking 
had  stopped 
methamphetamine  but  hadn't  stopped  smoking 
marijuana.  

One  year  after  we  met,  we  had  an  engagement 
party and 9 months later our eldest daughter Eva 
was born. Life felt good.  

 
 
6  months  after  Eva  was  born,  we  found  out  we 
were  expecting  again.  Ariana  had  started  to  seek 
the  Lord  by  now  so  when  doctors  said  our  son 
would  have  birth  defects,  she  refused  to  accept 
that.  I  struggled  to  relate  to  her  faith.  When  our 
son,  Mirraco  was  born  without  birth  defects  my 
wife proudly announced, “I told you so.”  

Two  years  later  we  finally  married  and  Ariana 
became pregnant with our third child.  

Doctors said she wasn’t growing well and wouldn’t 
make it full term. Again, Ariana refused to accept 
what the doctors were saying. Alicia was born full 
term and healthy too.  

Life was going well until my addiction to marijuana 
took  over. 
I  was  dependent,  abusive  and 
unreliable.  

Our marriage started to fall apart. I would run from 
the problems I was causing and blame others.  

At  3  months  old  Alicia  suffered  from  reflux.  We 
took her to hospital “just to be safe” but had no idea 
the turn our life was about to take.  

Alicia  was  misdiagnosed  and  given  many 
unnecessary  medications. 
suffered  3 
cardiovascular  collapses.  She  was  ventilated 
incorrectly and had no oxygen for about an hour.  

She 

Alicia was flown to Starship Hospital in a coma. We 
had no idea she had been  given  an overdose. We 
were  told  that  Alicia  wouldn’t  survive  and  were 
pressured to donate her organs.  

My  wife's  Auntie  and  Uncle  came  to  the  hospital 
and told her to pray in tongues. I had no idea why 
she was talking like that.  

After 4 days Alicia was taken off life support. She 
started crying. It made us cry too.  

On the 6th day, Ariana told me that the Lord said 
we had to take Alicia home. We were scared to take 
her against the doctor’s wishes, so we didn’t.  

That night Ariana stopped a nurse giving Alicia the 
wrong medication.  

On  the  7th  day  she  stopped  a  nurse  from  adding 
water into breastmilk to give to Alicia.  

On the 8th day Alicia pulled the feeding tube out of 
her  nose  and  my  wife  decided  she  was  going  to 
breastfeed her. Despite doctors' warnings that she 
would choke, Alicia did fine and the  feeding tube 
was never put back in.  

On  the  9th  day  Ariana  was  woken  in  the  early 
hours  to  find  Alicia  had  a  folded  blanket  placed 
over her head.  

Ariana was determined to leave the hospital with 
Alicia. She asked the doctors 
what  needed  to  be  done  to 
take  her  home.  It  was  clear 
that  they  weren't  going  to 
discharge Alicia.  

On  the  10th  day  Ariana 
wrote a self-discharge letter, 
and  we  headed  home.  The 
doctors tried to get hospital 
social  workers  and  security 
to  stop  us  leaving.  None  of 
them were available.  

Next  morning 
Oranga 
social  workers 
Tamariki 
came to our home. They had 
received an urgent report that Alicia needed to be 
returned  to  Starship  immediately  by  whatever 
means necessary. The case with Oranga Tamariki 
was closed suddenly 2 weeks later.  

The  Lord  protected  Alicia  in  every  area  and  her 
health  began  to  improve.  But  I  wasn’t  ready  to 
admit it was God at work restoring her. I used to 
mock  God  and  Ariana  whenever  she  would 
mention God.  

One  morning  I  had  been  fighting  with  Ariana 
before I left for work. I didn’t make it far before I 
lost control of the vehicle, spun out, went through 
a telephone pole and rolled multiple times through 
a  paddock  before  coming  to  a  stop.  God  had  His 
hand on my life. I wasn’t wearing a seatbelt, but I 
had  braced  myself  by  holding  the  steering  wheel 
and the grab handle above the driver's door. When 
I told Ariana what happened she said there was no 
handle  above  the  door.  Wanting  to  prove  myself 
right  I  went  to get my  wallet out  of the  van later 

that  day.  I  checked  and  found  that  there  was  no 
door handle. Ariana said it was God’s hand holding 
me.  Looking  back  now,  I  can't  deny  it,  but  at  the 
time I didn’t want to accept God.  

I  was  still  an  addict.  I  would  be  abusive  when 
things didn’t go my way. I decided to leave Ariana 
and my family. We didn’t have a car, so I got on my 
bike  and  rode  off,  not 
knowing  what  I  was 
going  to  do  next.  But 
God knew.

I

in

Geoff  Winter, 
pastor  of  the  church, 
answered:  “How  can  I 
help?”  

I  asked  if  he  could 
come and meet me. He 
it  was  his

birthday  so  I  said  I 
would  be  fine,  but  he 
insisted  that  he  would 
come.  

After  2  hours  of 
ministering  to  me  I 
gave  my  heart  to  the 
Lord. Geoff offered to help pay for a motel for the 
night. I said I would bike back home, but my legs 
were so sore I decided to challenge God: “If you are 
real, the next car that goes past will pick me up.”  

Well,  the  next  car  was  a  little  Mini  Cooper,  the 
driver offered me a ride. I didn't want to leave my 
bike,  but  he  assured  me  it  could  fit.  When  he 
opened the boot, he already had a bike in there, but 
managed to fit my bike in as well. He asked where 
I had come from. I told him and he asked if I was a 
Christian. I thought for a second and then replied 
“Yes, I am”. I had just given my heart to the Lord. 

He was a Christian too. He was happy to give me a 
ride and I felt blessed.  

For a while, I still wanted to live the best of both 
worlds. Then COVID hit and our family went to stay 
with my Ariana's Auntie and Uncle in Greytown. I 
went to a FGBMFI dinner meeting with her uncle. 
That  night  my  wife  urged  me  to  join.  I  became  a

By  the  grace  of  God, 
with good teaching and 
guidance our marriage 
has been restored. I am 
free  from  addiction  to 
marijuana,  and  now 
pursue  God’s  will  for 
me.  

Our family is thriving now. I am willing to do God’s 
work. 

After 27 years I reconciled with my Dad.  

We are out of debt by living for God and not by the 
desires of the flesh.  

Whenever  I  am  asked  how  our  marriage  was 
restored,  I  simply  say  that  we  stopped  being  the 
people we wanted to be and started being who God 
created us to be.

From the National Presidents Pen 

As  we  approach  the  end  of  the  year,  let  us  recall 
with  thankfulness,  some  of  its  highlights:  an 
outstanding national convention at New Plymouth, 
several successful regional conferences, seminars 
and  camps,  many  excellent  and  effective  chapter 
meetings, and new chapters being formed or in the 
process of being created. 

A further development has been the appointment 
of  Alvin  Humm  as  new  national  administrator  as 
from this month. John  Speirs informed the Board 
early  this  year  that  he  would  be  standing  down 
from that job as soon as we had a replacement. It 
took  us  several  months  to  identify  the  right 
candidate.  John  took  up  the  role  7  years  ago, 
shifted the National Office to Mosgiel, upgraded all 
our  publications  and  transformed  the  office 
systems  to  a  high  level  of  efficiency.  We  are  so 
grateful for his faithful and dedicated service to the 
Fellowship. 

We are looking forward to Alvin picking up the role 
and  serving  the  Fellowship  well.  His  engineering 
and 
administrative 
background  give  him 
that 
significant  skills 
will  enable  him 
to 
contribute  to  the  well-
being  of  the  Fellowship 
in  the  years  to  come. 
Alvin  was  involved  in 
the  CBD  chapter 
in 
for  many 
Auckland 
years so is very familiar 
with  the  work  of  the 
Fellowship. 

Alvin’s 
With 
appointment 
having 
taken place so late in the 
the  Board  has 
year, 
decided to defer the next 
national  conference  to 
2025. There are several reasons for that. Planning 
for  a  conference  requires  significant  forward 
planning and experience in running conferences. It 
would  be  a  formidable  task  to  place  on  Alvin’s 
shoulders as he will take some time to become fully 
conversant with his role. 

We  also  need  to  locate  a  suitable  South  Island 
venue  that  meets  our  requirements  for  ease  of 

arrangements 

accommodation. 
travel 
Conference facilities need to be booked a year or so 
in advance, so the board will be actively seeking to 
identify the right place early next year for 2025. 

and 

For  2024  the  board  will  be  exploring  ways  to 
ensure  that  regional  conferences  and  camps  are 
well  supported.  So  much  valuable  ministry 
happens when we gather together for an extended 
period of time. We encourage each member to take 
advantage  of  the  regional  gatherings  planned  for 
your regions. 

At the last national AGM a remit was proposed to 
create a new associate membership category with 
the  aim  of  encouraging  younger  men  to  become 
members.  That  remit  was  left  for  the  Board  to 
consider  and  see  if  it  was  practical  to  introduce 
associate membership. 

After much discussion, research and consultation 
with our IT provider, it is clear that there will be 
significant  problems  with  the  office  software  to 
amend  our  membership  registration  systems  to 
introduce the additional 
class  of  membership. 
Taking into account the 
very cheap membership 
fee,  and  introducing  a

local chapters to adopt a

circumstances,

class” 

We  look  forward  to  a 
New  Year  with  great 
expectations of chapters growing in numbers and 
allowing God’s Spirit to work among us, increasing 
in  us  a  love  for  our  fellow  man  by  sharing  our 
testimonies of God’s goodness and grace.

Australian Convention

The  FGBMFI  &  FGBA  Australian  National 
Convention  for  2023  was  held  in  Adelaide  on 
September  14th  to  16th  2023.  This  was  a 
momentous occasion as it was a celebration of the 
union  of  the  two  distinct  FGB  organisations 
operating  in  Australia,  FGBMFI  and  FGBA.  They 
even had a unity cake, which was presented, then 
cut and eaten by all.  

In  addition  to  the  Australians,  there  were 
representatives  from  the  international  directors 
(president  and  secretary),  Philippines,  Malaysia, 
Indonesia, Fiji and New Zealand. 

The  theme  of  the  convention  was  “It’s  time  to 
invest”. The theme was conveyed through the talks 
on  investing  financially  in  FGBMFI,  investing  in 
people via outreach, time and service.  

The International President Francis Owusu spoke 
about how now was the time to go out and bring in 
the end times harvest of people. He shared about 
how  God  had  spoken  to  multiple  international 
directors  to  vote  him  into  office,  much  to  his 
disbelief (“who me”?)  

In  one  of Francis’s talks, he was  emphasising  the 
need to worship God and while marching along the 
front  of the  room, he  was  slain in the  spirit.  This 
resulted  in  a  spontaneous  prayer  and  ministry 
time involving Jimmy Njino and the leaders of the 
multiple groups. 

Multiple testimonies were shared, Francis Owusu 
Doug  Woolley 
(International 

President), 

Secretary), 

Daniel  Wright 
(International 
(President  FGBMFI  Australia),  George  Perry 
(Chairman FGBA), Ardian Kristanto (International 
Director  -  Indonesia),  Samuel  Tan  (Malaysian 
National  Deputy  President),  Fong  Hoong  Heng 
(FGBMFI  Malaysia  National  President),  Anthony 
Putihrai (FGBMFI Regional Vice President of Asia 
Pacific). 

Multiple  speakers  shared  about  their  outreach 
programmes.  My  favourite,  from  the  Philippines, 
was the drift racing team that they sponsored. The 
Malaysians shared about their 30,000+ attendees 
at  open  air  tent  meetings.  These  attendees  were 
hungry for more of God and willing to stand in the 
rain. 

David-John  “Chief”  MacKellar  shared  about  “The 
School  of  the  Vision”,  a  course  designed  to  get 
people  excited  about  the  original  FGBMFI  vision 
that Demos Shakarian had. 

At  the  City  of  Tea  Tree  Gully  Prayer  Breakfast,  I 
was fascinated to see lots of attendees praying for 
their  city  and  country.  Senators,  mayors  and 
influential
