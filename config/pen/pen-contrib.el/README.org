* Pen.el contrib library

Integration of =pen.el= with other emacs packages.

I have kept this separated to help distinguish

** =pen-org-brain=
I combine GPT-3 with org-brain to expand on topics, suggesting subtopics and providing an interactive tutor for any topic.

- Subtopic generation
- explore arbitrary topics with =pen.el=
- automatically generating subtopics
- invoke the GPT-3 tutor to answer questions within that context

Make GPT-3 handlers common functions such as showing documentation.
