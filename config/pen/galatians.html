Galatians <span class="three">3</span>
<span class="unicode">‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾</span>
You foolish Galatians, who has bewitched you,
before whose eyes Jesus Christ was publicly
portrayed as <span class="toby">crucified?</span>

This is the only thing I want to find out from
<span class="codekeywords">you</span><span class="subdued">:</span> did you receive the Spirit by the works
of the Law, <span class="logic">or</span> by hearing <span class="codekeywords">with</span> faith<span class="brightoperator2">?</span>

Are you <span class="googlered">so</span> foolish<span class="brightoperator2">?</span>

Having begun by the Spirit, are you now being
perfected by the flesh<span class="brightoperator2">?</span>

Did you suffer <span class="googlered">so</span> many things in vain--<span class="logic">if</span>
indeed it was in vain<span class="brightoperator2">?</span>

So <span class="logic">then</span>, does He who provides you <span class="codekeywords">with</span> the
Spirit <span class="logic">and</span> works miracles among you, do it by
the works of the Law, <span class="logic">or</span> by hearing <span class="codekeywords">with</span>
faith<span class="brightoperator2">?</span>

Even <span class="googlered">so</span> Abraham believed God, <span class="logic">and</span> it was
reckoned to him as <span class="toby">righteousness.</span>

<span class="logic">Therefore</span>, be sure that it is those who are of
faith who are sons of Abraham.

The Scripture, foreseeing that God would
justify the Gentiles by faith, preached the
gospel beforehand to Abraham, saying, <span class="unicode">“</span>All the
nations will be blessed in you.<span class="unicode">”</span> So <span class="logic">then</span> those
who are of faith are blessed <span class="codekeywords">with</span> Abraham, the
believer.

<span class="codekeywords">For</span> as many as are of the works of the Law are
under a curse<span class="discrete">;</span> <span class="codekeywords">for</span> it is written, <span class="unicode">“</span>Cursed is
everyone who does <span class="seleniumError">not abide</span> by all things
written in the book of the law, to perform
them.<span class="unicode">”</span> Now that <span class="seleniumError">no one is</span> justified by the Law
before God is evident<span class="discrete">;</span> <span class="codekeywords">for</span>, <span class="unicode">“</span>The righteous man
shall live by faith.<span class="unicode">”</span> However, the Law <span class="failing">is not</span>
of faith<span class="discrete">;</span> on the contrary, <span class="unicode">“</span>He who practices
them shall live by them.<span class="unicode">”</span> Christ redeemed us
from the curse of the Law, having become a
curse <span class="codekeywords">for</span> us--<span class="codekeywords">for</span> it is written, <span class="unicode">“</span>Cursed is
everyone who hangs on a tree<span class="unicode">”</span>-- in order that
in Christ Jesus the blessing of Abraham might
come to the Gentiles, <span class="googlered">so</span> that we would receive
the promise of the Spirit through faith.

Brethren, I speak in terms of human relations<span class="subdued">:</span>
even though it is only a man<span class="unicode">’</span>s covenant, yet
when it has been ratified, <span class="seleniumError">no one sets</span> it
aside <span class="logic">or</span> adds conditions to it.

Now the promises were spoken to Abraham <span class="logic">and</span> to
his seed.

He does <span class="seleniumError">not say</span>, <span class="unicode">“</span><span class="logic">And</span> to seeds,<span class="unicode">”</span> as <span class="toby">referring</span>
to many, <span class="logic">but</span> rather to <span class="one">one</span>, <span class="unicode">“</span><span class="logic">And</span> to your
seed,<span class="unicode">”</span> that is, Christ.

What I am saying is this<span class="subdued">:</span> the Law, which came
<span class="four">four</span> hundred <span class="logic">and</span> thirty years later, does <span class="seleniumError">not</span>
invalidate a covenant previously ratified by
God, <span class="googlered">so</span> as to nullify the promise.

<span class="codekeywords">For</span> <span class="logic">if</span> the inheritance is based on law, it is
<span class="seleniumError">no longer based</span> on a promise<span class="discrete">;</span> <span class="logic">but</span> God has
granted it to Abraham by means of a promise.

Why the Law <span class="logic">then</span><span class="brightoperator2">?</span>

It was <span class="onlyhex">added</span> because of transgressions, having
been ordained through angels by the agency of
a mediator, until the seed would come to whom
the promise had been made.

Now a mediator <span class="failing">is not</span> <span class="codekeywords">for</span> <span class="one">one</span> party only<span class="discrete">;</span>
whereas God is only <span class="one">one</span>.

Is the Law <span class="logic">then</span> contrary to the promises of
God<span class="brightoperator2">?</span>

<span class="five">May</span> it never be! <span class="codekeywords">For</span> <span class="logic">if</span> a law had been given
which was able to impart life, <span class="discrete">then</span>
righteousness would indeed have been based <span class="serviceAdd">on</span>
law.

<span class="logic">But</span> the Scripture has shut up everyone under
sin, <span class="googlered">so</span> that the promise by faith in Jesus
Christ might be given to those who believe.

<span class="logic">But</span> before faith came, we were kept in custody
under the law, being shut up to the faith
which was later to be revealed.

<span class="logic">Therefore</span> the Law has become our tutor to lead
us to Christ, <span class="googlered">so</span> that we <span class="five">may</span> be justified by
faith.

<span class="logic">But</span> now that faith has come, we are <span class="seleniumError">no longer</span>
under a tutor.

<span class="codekeywords">For</span> you are all sons of God through faith in
Christ Jesus.

<span class="codekeywords">For</span> all of you who were baptized into Christ
have clothed yourselves <span class="codekeywords">with</span> Christ.

There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is
neither slave nor free man, there is neither
male nor female<span class="discrete">;</span> <span class="codekeywords">for</span> you are all <span class="one">one</span> in Christ
Jesus.

<span class="logic">And</span> <span class="logic">if</span> you belong to Christ, <span class="logic">then</span> you are
Abraham<span class="unicode">’</span>s descendants, heirs according to
promise.
