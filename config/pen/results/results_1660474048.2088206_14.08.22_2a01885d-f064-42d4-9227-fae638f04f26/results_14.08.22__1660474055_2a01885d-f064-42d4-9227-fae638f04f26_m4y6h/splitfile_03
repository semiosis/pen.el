The white hole is a region where the gravitational field has intense strength and pulls matter inwards instead of pushing outwards, causing the black holeâ€™s event horizon to grow. This increases the area of space around the black hole where gravity prevents light from escaping.

It was the largest accidental explosion of a rocket in history, and resulted in a loss of control and two destroyed Arianes 5s. The failure occurred 43.43 seconds after launch, at the completion of the seventh elliptical "minute 87" burn. The final 17 seconds were lost to mission controllers attempting to correct course due to a thrust vectoring guidance problem with the vehicle's two boosters. The incorrect operation of the boosters caused both to veer
