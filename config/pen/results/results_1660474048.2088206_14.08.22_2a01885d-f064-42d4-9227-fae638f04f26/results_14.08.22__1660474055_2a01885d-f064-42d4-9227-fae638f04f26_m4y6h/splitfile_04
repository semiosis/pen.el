A white hole is a region of spacetime exhibiting gravitational acceleration that repels other objects of sufficiently low mass. The opposite region is a black hole, or a region of spacetime exhibiting strong gravitational acceleration that attracts other objects of sufficiently low mass.

The origin of the name is not certain, with one hypothesis deriving "white hole" from the color of the polar jet streaming out around a black hole's event horizon, or primary science spot. Another hypothesis suggests that "white hole" comes from being so equilibrium and yet constantly emitting electromagnetic radiation with the power of an entire galaxy.
