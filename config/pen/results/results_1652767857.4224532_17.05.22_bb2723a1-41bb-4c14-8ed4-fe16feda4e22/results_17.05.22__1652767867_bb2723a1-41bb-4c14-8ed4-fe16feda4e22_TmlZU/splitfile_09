+ =Matthew 5:28= ::  But I tell you that anyone who looks at a woman with lust has already committed adultery with her in his heart.

You have to avoid looking at a woman with lust.
You have to purify your heart.

+ =Matthew 5:48= ::  Therefore I tell you, whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven; and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven.
