+ =Matthew 5:28= :: You have heard that it was said, “Do not commit adultery.” But I say to you that anyone who looks at a woman lustfully has already committed adultery with her in his heart.

You have to control your eyes, your thoughts and your desires.
You have to control your body, not the other way around.
