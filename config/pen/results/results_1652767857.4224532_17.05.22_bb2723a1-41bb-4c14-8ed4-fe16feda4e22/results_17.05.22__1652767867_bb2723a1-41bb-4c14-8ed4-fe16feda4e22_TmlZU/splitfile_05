+ =Matthew 5:28= :: If your eye is good, the whole body will be full of light. But if your eye is bad, the whole body will be full of darkness.

Your eyes are the light source of your body.
Your heart is the light source of your eyes.
Your heart is the light source of your whole body.

+ =Matthew 6:22= :: Therefore I tell you, do not set your hopes on things above
