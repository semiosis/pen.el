The above code is a simple program that asks the user for a search term,
then prints out the results of that search term.

The fromMaybe function is a function that takes two arguments,
a default value and a maybe value.
If the maybe value is Nothing, the default value is returned.
If the maybe value is Just something, the something is returned.
