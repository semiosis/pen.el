I interpret this dream as a warning to be attentive to the world around me. In the dream I was with people but I couldn't hear anything they were saying. Then I saw visions in the sky, and I felt like I was in a different dimension. I believe that this dream was a warning to me that we are all connected and that there is something much more powerful than us that is at work in the world. I believe that this dream was a warning for me to be more aware of my surroundings and of the things that are happening around me.
