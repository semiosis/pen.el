"I always pray that my spiritual children will love god who is everything so that he will make us worthy to enter his earthly uncreated church. We must begin from here. I always made the effort to pray to read the hymns of the church the holy scriptures and the lives of the saints may you do the same. I tried by the grace of god to approach god and may you also do the same. I beg all of you to forgive me for whatever I did to upset you"
