 Cubism is the only movement in painting that\nwas really new in the history of art. It is\nimpossible to consider it as a simple\nreaction against impressionism or a method of\nusing colour as a means of expression. It is a\nsense of the plasticity of forms, of their\npliability in space, of their resistance to\nthe treatment of the painter; it is also the\ninfinite possibilities of using the same\nmaterial in a new way.
