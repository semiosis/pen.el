 Ave Maria\nThe Lord is my shepherd\nI shall not want\nHe maketh me to lie down\nIn green pastures\nHe leadeth me beside the still waters\n(Adore)\nHail Mary full of grace\nThe Lord is with thee\nBlessed art thou among women\nAnd blessed is the fruit of thy womb Jesus\nHoly Mary Mother of God\n(Adore)
