                             Amazon EC2
                             Instance Metadata

   Amazon EC2 provides metadata about your EC2 instances and resources.
   You can use the metadata to configure applications and to monitor your
   resources. The metadata is available as soon as an instance is
   launched.

   You can access the instance metadata using HTTP or HTTPS. For example:

   http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/

   https://169.
