Atoms are like the numbers you are used to in math, except they are immutable.
They are like numbers in that they have numeric operations such as +, - and *.
But they are different in that they have no type, and can't be used in function
arguments.
The @ is a programmatic convenience for working with atoms.
It is used as a prefix to a variable that refers to an atom.
