 Lastly,
there are literal truths and there are
metaphorical truths. Most of the ideas
presented in this video are metaphorical. That
is, valuable truths that will provide you with
great rewards if you treat them as
perfectly literal truth, but are in reality not
perfectly literal truth that said somewhere
hidden in the metaphysical world of the muse
there is I believe literal truth.
