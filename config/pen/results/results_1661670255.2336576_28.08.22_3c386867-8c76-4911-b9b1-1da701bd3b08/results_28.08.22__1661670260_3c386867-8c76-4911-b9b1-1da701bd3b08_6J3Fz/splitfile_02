"table.iloc" is a pandas function that allows you to select rows and columns by number, in the order that they appear in the data frame.

You can also select multiple rows and columns using ":" for a range of values.

For example, to select the first row and first column of a data frame:

table.iloc[0, 0]

Or to select the first two rows and all of the columns:

table.iloc[0:2,
