"undef" is a special scalar value that is returned when a function or method is called and the function or method has not been defined.

The following is an example of using undef:

sub edbi_prepare {

return undef unless $dbh;

$sth->finish() if $sth;

my ($sql) = @_;

our $sth = $dbh->prepare($sql) or return undef;

return
