"When I returned to the world, I continued to commit sins which today are very many. The world, however, thought highly of me and everyone shouts that I'm a saint. I, however, feel that I am the most sinful person in the world. Of course, whatever I remembered, I confessed and I know God has forgiven me, but now I have the feeling that my spiritual sins are very many and I ask all those who have known me to pray for me because for as long as I lived, I humbly prayed for you too."
