covered a new type of neuron that can learn to represent
    arbitrary functions of its inputs. We call these neurons multimodal
    neurons, because they can learn to represent multiple functions.
    We’ve demonstrated their effectiveness on the MNIST dataset, where
    we achieve state-of-the-art results with a small number of neurons.
    This work is described in the paper “Multimodal Neurons for
    Learning to Represent and Generalize Abstract Data” by Dauphin et al.
