 The human brings their proposal before the girl, who may or may not agree to the marriage. If the girl agrees to the marriage, the human and girl are considered betrothed and are required to fulfill a series of community defined marriage customs. If the girl declines or fails to respond before a set deadline, the human is considered to have failed and is removed from the girl's social group.
