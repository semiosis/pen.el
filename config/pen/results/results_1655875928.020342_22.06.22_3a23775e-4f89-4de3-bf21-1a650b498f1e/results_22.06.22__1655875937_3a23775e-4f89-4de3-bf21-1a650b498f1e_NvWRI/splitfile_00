"On the holy mountain I became obedient to two\nelders the true brothers Pantalemon and\nYanichios. They happen to be very devout and\nfull of virtue I love them very much and\nbecause of that with their blessing I gave\nthem absolute obedience they helped me a lot I\nalso felt great love for God and got along\nvery well however because of my sins God\nallowed me to become ill and my elders told me\nto go to my parents in my village of Saint\nJohn Evia although I sinned a lot from when I\nwas a small child"
