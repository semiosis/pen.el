"I wanted to follow his example, so with a lot of difficulty I secretly left my parents and came to Cavsocolivia. On the holy mountain I became obedient to two elders the true brothers Pantalemon and Yanichios they happen to be very devout and full of virtue I love them very much and because of that with their blessing I gave them absolute obedience they helped me a lot I also felt great love for God and got along very well however because of my sins God allowed me to become ill and my elders told me to go to my parents in my village of Saint John Evia although I sinned a lot from when I was a small child."
