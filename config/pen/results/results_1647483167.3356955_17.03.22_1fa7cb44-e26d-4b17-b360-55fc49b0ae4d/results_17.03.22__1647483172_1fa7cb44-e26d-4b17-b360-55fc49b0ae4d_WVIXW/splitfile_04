Once upon a time, there was a sequence of 5 numbers:

f(0) = 1
f(1) = 4
f(2) = 9
f(3) = 121
f(4) = 12321

It looks like all the numbers in the sequence
are ()
  (interactive)
  (let ((lines-context 2))

    (if (not (listp current-prefix-arg))
        (setq lines-context (prefix-numeric-value current-prefix-arg)))

    (if (pen-selected)
        (call-interactively 'kill-region))
    (let ((suffix (pen-proceeding-lines lines-context)))
