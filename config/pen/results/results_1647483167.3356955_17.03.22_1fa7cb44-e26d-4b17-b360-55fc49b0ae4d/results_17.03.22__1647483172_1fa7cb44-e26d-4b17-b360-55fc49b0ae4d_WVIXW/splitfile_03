Once upon a time I had written an extension to mark-word, which is useful
(defun pen-mark-word-with-context ()
  (interactive)
  (let ((lines-context 2))

    (if (not (listp current-prefix-arg))
        (setq lines-context (prefix-numeric-value current-prefix-arg)))

    (if (pen-selected)
        (call-interactively 'kill-region))
    (let ((suffix (pen-proceeding-lines lines-context)))
