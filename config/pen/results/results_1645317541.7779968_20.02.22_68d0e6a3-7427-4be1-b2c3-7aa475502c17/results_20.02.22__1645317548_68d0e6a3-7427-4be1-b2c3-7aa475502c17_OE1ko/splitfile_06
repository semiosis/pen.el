there was a pretty little girl who lived in a village near the forest.  Most days she spent at home with her mother, spinning yarn which the women of the village used to weave into fine shirts and trousers.  But it was not often that they had enough coin to buy meat for dinner, and they relied more and more on the few plants that grew in their tiny garden and on the few drops of water they could collect from the stream that ran down their stony hillside.
