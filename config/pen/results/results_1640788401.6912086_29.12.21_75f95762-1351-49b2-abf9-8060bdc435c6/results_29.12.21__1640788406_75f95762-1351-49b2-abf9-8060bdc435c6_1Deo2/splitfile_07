""cohere" refers to the quality of forming coherent shapes when pressing on a surface. For example, when you press your thumb and forefinger together, the two fingers will "cohere" and form a wider fist. It's the same with your phone: The edges of its display will "cohere" and form a curved surface when you press on it.
