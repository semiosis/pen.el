 The first step involves getting the girl. Perhaps the most important step is getting the girl. However, if the girl has already indicated her preference for the individual the next step is to ask for a date. If the date goes well, then a definitive relationship has been established. If the date does not go well, then the individual takes steps to limit contact with the girl and to seek help from other individuals in pursuit of the goal of earning the girl's hand in marriage.
