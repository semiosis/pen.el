 A wedding is a significant social event, and is often commonplace in cultures, and within cultures, as is the case in many western cultures, the wedding ceremony is preceded by a process known as courting. The process of courting begins when the two individuals have a mutual attraction, and is continued by progressively intimate actions until the successful conclusion of the process, at which point the two partners become married.
