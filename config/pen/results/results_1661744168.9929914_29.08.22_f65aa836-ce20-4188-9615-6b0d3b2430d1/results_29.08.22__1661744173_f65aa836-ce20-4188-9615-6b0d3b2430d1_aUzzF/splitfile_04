"multifile" is a directive that lets you define a predicate in multiple files.

You can use it to define a predicate in multiple files, and have the system
know that they all define the same predicate.  This is useful if you have a
predicate that is used in multiple files, and you want to avoid duplicating
the definition.  For example:

:- multifile p/2.

p(X, Y) :-
        q(X, Y).
