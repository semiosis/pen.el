I, the dreamer, am a computer genious.
There is a white dragon, who represents good and the other a red dragon, who represents evil.
The genious is given a challenge to create a computer system, which is able to simulate incredible realities, beyond space and time.
The genious is left with no password, which means that the genious has to find the password.
