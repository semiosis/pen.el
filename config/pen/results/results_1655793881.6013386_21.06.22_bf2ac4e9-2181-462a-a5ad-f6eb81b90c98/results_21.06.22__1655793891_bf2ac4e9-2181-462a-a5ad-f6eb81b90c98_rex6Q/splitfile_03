"The book is, nevertheless, an introduction: no prior knowledge of the subject is needed in order to understand it; and though we will occasionally address certain technical issues, these have been kept to a minimum, and been made as reader-friendly as possible. Another theme of the book is the continuing relevance and power of non-materialistic approaches to the philosophy of mind. To be sure, materialism - the view that the mind can be fully accounted for in terms of purely physical processes of the sort studied by the natural sciences - is today the dominant tendency in the field."
