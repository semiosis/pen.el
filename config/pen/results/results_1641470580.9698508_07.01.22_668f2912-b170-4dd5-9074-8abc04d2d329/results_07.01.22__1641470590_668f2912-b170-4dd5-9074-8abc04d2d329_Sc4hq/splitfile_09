: a Dormouse was sitting
  between them, fast asleep, and the other two were
  using it as a cushion, resting their elbows on it,
  and talking over its head. 'Very uncomfortable for
  the Dormouse,' thought Alice; 'only, as it's asleep, I
  suppose it doesn't mind.'

  The table was a large one, but the three were all
  sitting in a corner together, with their elbows on
  the table, and their heads bent forward, talking in
  low voices: so quietly, that Alice could hardly hear
  what they were saying.

  The March Hare was saying to the Hatter: 'But I've
  had nearly as many tea-drinks as I can manage today; and
  I've had nothing to eat all day: I can't possibly drink
  another drop.'

  'You must be mad!' said the Hatter.
