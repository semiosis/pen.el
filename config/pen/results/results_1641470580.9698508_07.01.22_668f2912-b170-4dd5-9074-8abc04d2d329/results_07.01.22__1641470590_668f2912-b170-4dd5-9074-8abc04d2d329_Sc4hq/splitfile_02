: a Dormouse was sitting
  between them, fast asleep, and the other two were
  using it as a cushion, resting their elbows on it,
  and talking over its head. 'Very uncomfortable for
  the Dormouse,' thought Alice; 'only, as it's asleep, I
  suppose it doesn't mind.'

  The table was a large one, but the three were all
  sitting on the edge of it, with their legs dangling
  down into the ground. 'I wish they'd get up and sit in
  some other way,' thought Alice; 'I should like to sit
  so that I could see the Dormouse.' But even this was
  impossible: she went on growing, and never stopped to
  wonder where she was till she arrived at her usual
  size: then she got up and looked about her.
