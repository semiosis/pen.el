: a Dormouse was sitting
  between them, fast asleep, and the other two were
  using it as a cushion, resting their elbows on it,
  and talking over its head. 'Very uncomfortable for
  the Dormouse,' thought Alice; 'only, as it's asleep, I
  suppose it doesn't mind.'

  The table was a large one, but the three were all
  sitting in a corner together, with their elbows on
  the table, and their heads bent down close
  together. 'No room! No room!' they cried out when
  they saw Alice coming. 'There's plenty of room!' said
  Alice indignantly, and she sat down in a large arm-chair at one end of the table.

  'Have some wine,' the March Hare said in an encouraging tone.

  Alice looked all round the table, but there was
  nothing on it but tea.
