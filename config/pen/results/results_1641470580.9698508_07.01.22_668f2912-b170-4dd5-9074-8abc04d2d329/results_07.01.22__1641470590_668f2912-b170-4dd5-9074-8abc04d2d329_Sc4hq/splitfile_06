: a Dormouse was sitting
  between them, fast asleep, and the other two were
  using it as a cushion, resting their elbows on it, and
  talking over its head. 'Very uncomfortable for the
  Dormouse,' thought Alice; 'only, as it's asleep, I
  suppose it doesn't mind.'

  The table was a large one, but the three were all
  crowded together at one corner of it: 'No room! No
  room!' they cried out when they saw Alice coming.
  'There's plenty of room!' said Alice indignantly, and
  she sat down in a large arm-chair at one end of the table.

  'Have some wine,' the March Hare said in an encouraging
  tone.

  Alice looked all round the table, but there was nothing
  on it but tea. 'I don't see any wine,' she remarked.
