The white dragon represents me.\nThe red dragon represents the computer.\nThe computer genious represents the people who programmed the computer.\nI went to their website and they had no password.\nI'm going in.\nI'm stuck in this computer program.\nI really like it here and I don't want to get out of here.\nSo I'm going to destroy all the computers so that I can get out of here and go back to normal life.
