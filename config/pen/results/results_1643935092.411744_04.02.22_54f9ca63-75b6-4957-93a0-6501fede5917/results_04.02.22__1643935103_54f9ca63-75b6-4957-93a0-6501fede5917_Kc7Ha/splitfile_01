The car is a symbol for the penis. The car park
is the vagina. The car park is the male womb. The
reversible car is a symbol for the bisexuality of
the penis. The car can drive in both directions,
like the penis can be used for both urination
and ejaculation. The two different names
are the different names of the vagina: 'cunt' and
'pussy'.
The penis is metaphorically a reversible car.
