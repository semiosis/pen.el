The reversible car is a metaphor for my dad's
dedication to his career, but also his dedication
to his family.

He left early in the morning to go to work, but
returned in the evening to spend time with his
family.

The car park is a metaphor for life, and the
direction you choose determines the
outcome of your life.

The car has two different names, one if you are
driving it backwards, and one if you are driving
it forwards.

I choose to live my life in the direction of love,
which is forwards.

I'm pretty sure that my dad is a real person, and
that he really drives a car.
