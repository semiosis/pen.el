The reversible car is a symbol for the
ability to change your perspective.
This is something I have been thinking about
a lot recently.
The fact that my dad was driving it means that
this is something that I have to do myself.
I don't think my dad would be able to do it for me.
The names of the car are a reference to the
'X' and the 'M' keys on a keyboard.
This is a reference to the fact that I
need to change my perspective and that I need
to do it myself.
