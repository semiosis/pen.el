 
  imprinted on my skin. 
  Each one a mark of discovery, 
  a map to your unknown territory. 
  I am in the wonder of you. 
  The shape of your thighs, where they move below your belly,

  I am in the wonder of you. 
  The spirals of your DNA are a message I read every time

  I kiss the place between your neck and shoulder.
  I am in the wonder of you.
