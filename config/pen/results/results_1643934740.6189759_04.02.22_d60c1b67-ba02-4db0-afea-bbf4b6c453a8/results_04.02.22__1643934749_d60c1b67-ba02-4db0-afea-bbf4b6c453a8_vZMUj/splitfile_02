The dream is clearly about the Apocalypse and the End of the World. The red constellations in the sky are the red dragon and the red horse, as described in Revelation. The circular UFOs crashing into the ground are the four horsemen of the Apocalypse, as described in Revelation. The four horsemen are the Antichrist, the False Prophet, the Beast and Death. The Antichrist is the red dragon, the False Prophet is the red horse, the Beast is the red horse, and Death is the black horse.
