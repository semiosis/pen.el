a time, there was a little girl who lived in a village near the forest.  Every day she would go and play in the forest with her friends.  One day she came upon a wolf hiding in her friend's trees.  The little girl began to cry, and the wolf became very angry.  He was going to eat the little girl, but her crying awoke some hunters who were in the forest nearby.  The hunters shot the wolf, saving the little girl from certain death."
