"provide" is a macro that allows you to define a function or a
variable that will be available to the user of your library.

The first argument to "provide" is a list of symbols.
The second argument is a string that describes what the symbols
defined by the first argument do.

For example, the code above defines a function called "pi" and
a function called "pi.f", and a variable called "pi", and a
variable called "pi.
