The vivid red constellations are a symbolic
representation of the spiritual awakening process
that I have been experiencing for a few years.
I have been noticing that the universe seems to
be breaking down into patterns of geometric
shapes. I have also been noticing that my own
thoughts and dreams have been manifesting into
reality.
I have been noticing that my dreams are
actually prophetic.
I have been noticing that the spiritual
universe is more real than the physical universe.
The circular UFOs crashing into the ground
represent the idea that the earth is being
invaded by spiritual forces.
The UFO phenomenon is real, but I do not
think that UFOs are piloted by extraterrestrials.
I think that UFOs are piloted by spiritual
forces.
The fact that I have been seeing UFOs in my
dreams and waking life, suggests that
I am being spiritually contacted.
