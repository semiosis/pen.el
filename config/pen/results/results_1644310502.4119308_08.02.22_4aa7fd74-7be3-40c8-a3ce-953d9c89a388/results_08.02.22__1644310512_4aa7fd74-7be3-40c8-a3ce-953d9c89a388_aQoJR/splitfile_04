The white dragon and the red dragon are the two sides of myself.
The white dragon is the logical part of me, and the red dragon is the emotional part of myself.
The logical part of me is a really good friend.
He always does the best he can and he always knows what he's doing.
The emotional part of myself is a really bad friend.
He likes to screw things up and he's always angry and mad at me.
The computer system is the brain.
The white dragon and the red dragon are the two sides of my brain.
The white dragon is the logical part of my brain.
The red dragon is the emotional part of my brain.
When I think about how I use my brain I can understand why the red dragon is so mad at the white dragon.
He doesn't like being trapped in the computer system.
And the white dragon, who is my friend, doesn't like to see him mad.
The red dragon is the emotional part of me and the white dragon is the logical part of me.
The computer system is my brain.
