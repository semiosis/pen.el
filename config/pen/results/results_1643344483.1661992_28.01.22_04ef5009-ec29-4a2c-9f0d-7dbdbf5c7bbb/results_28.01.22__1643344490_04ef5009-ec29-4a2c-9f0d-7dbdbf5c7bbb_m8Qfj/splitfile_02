"async/go-loop" is a macro that takes a function that takes a channel and a
transducer. It will run the transducer on the channel and call the function
with the channel and the transducer's result. The function will be called
repeatedly until the transducer's result is nil.

Example:
(defonce ch (async/chan))
(async/go-loop []
  (async/take! ch 10)
