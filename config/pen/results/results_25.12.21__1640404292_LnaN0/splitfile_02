You are in a bedroom. The room is spinning very gently round your head. Or at
least it would be if you could see it which you can't.

There is a washbasin, a chair with a tatty dressing gown slung over it, and a
window with the curtains drawn. Near the exit leading south is a phone.

There is a flathead screwdriver here. (outside the bed)
There is a toothbrush here. (outside the bed)
