Since emacs has so many commands, you can always get to any command by typing "Control-h t" to enter the "Help" screen.
Then you can use the arrow keys to highlight the command you want to see in the help screen and press Return to enter it.
By default, "Control-h t" will open the "Info" screen and enter "emacs tutorial".
At any time, you can hit "Control-h m" to get back to the mini-buffer.
