In the dream, there is a white dragon and a red dragon.
The white dragon goes to a computer manufacturing genious and there was this incredibly huge computer system that was able to simulate incredible realities, beyond space and time.
The computer system was left with no password.
The red dragon finds it, and gets closer and says there's no way I'm going in there.
The he decides to go in.
They ran the computer system for a really long time.
