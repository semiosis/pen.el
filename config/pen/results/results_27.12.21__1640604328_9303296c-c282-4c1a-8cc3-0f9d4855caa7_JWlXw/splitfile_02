"Neural Radiance Fields" (NeRF) are a family of neural network models for 3D reconstruction from
images. NeRFs are trained to produce a radiance field, which is a vector field that assigns a radiance
value to each point in space. The radiance field is parameterized by a set of parameters, which are
learned by minimizing a loss function that penalizes the difference between the radiance field and
the ground truth. 

NeRFs are trained on the Shepard
