"Neural Radiance Fields" (NeRF) are a family of methods for reconstructing non-rigid 3D shapes from
images. NeRFs are an extension of Neural Fields, which are a generalization of the Radial Basis
Function (RBF) interpolation family. 

NeRFs are a natural fit for the problem of 3D shape reconstruction from images, as they are a natural
way to represent a family of shapes that are related by topology.
