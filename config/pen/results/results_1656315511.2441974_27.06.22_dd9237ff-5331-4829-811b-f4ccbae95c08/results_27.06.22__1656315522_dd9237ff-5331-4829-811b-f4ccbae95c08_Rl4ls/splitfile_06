The Rosetta Stone
    A stele composed of granodiorite inscribed
    with three versions of a decree issued in
    Memphis, Egypt, in 196 BC during the
    Ptolemaic dynasty on behalf of King
    Ptolemy V Epiphanes.

    The top and middle texts are in Ancient
    Egyptian using hieroglyphic and Demotic
    scripts respectively, while the bottom is
    in Ancient Greek.

    The decree has only minor differences
    between the three versions, making the
    Rosetta Stone key to deciphering the
    Egyptian scripts.
