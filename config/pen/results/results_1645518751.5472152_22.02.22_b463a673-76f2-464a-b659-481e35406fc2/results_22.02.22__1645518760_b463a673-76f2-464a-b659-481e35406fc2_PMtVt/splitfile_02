Liberty Prime is a towering, bipedal robot developed by the United States Army in the early 21st century before the Great War. Standing at over 7 meters tall and weighing in at over 2,000 kilograms, Liberty Prime was the largest and most powerful combat robot ever built by the U.S. military. Equipped with a devastating arsenal of weapons, including a 50-megaton nuclear bomb, Liberty Prime was designed to liberate Occupied America from the Communist Chinese and their Soviet allies.

However, the robot was never completed in time to see combat, and was instead stored in the Liberty Prime Robotics Facility in the Boston suburb of Malden until the Great War destroyed the U.S. and its military. Sometime after the war, Liberty Prime was discovered by the Brotherhood of Steel, who repaired and reactivated the robot. Now, Liberty Prime serves as the Brotherhood's primary weapon against the forces of the Commonwealth.
