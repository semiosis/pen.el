Liberty Prime is a towering, bipedal robot that was created by the United States military in the early 21st century. He is heavily armed, and is equipped with a variety of weapons, including a powerful laser cannon that can incinerate enemies in a single blast. He is also equipped with powerful armor that can withstand heavy enemy fire.

Liberty Prime was originally designed as a weapon to help the United States win the war against China, but he was never deployed to the battlefield. After the war ended, Liberty Prime was stored in a government laboratory, where he remained for many years.

In the year 2277, Liberty Prime was finally activated by the Brotherhood of Steel, a group of scientists and warriors who are dedicated to preserving the remnants of civilization in the post-apocalyptic wasteland. Liberty Prime is now the Brotherhood's most powerful weapon, and he is used to help them fight their enemies, including the Enclave, a group of scientists who seek to rebuild the destroyed civilization of the past.
