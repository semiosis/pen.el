"Media, the way we usually think of it, consists of a few things. There are the electronic media, such as radio and television. The                     electronic media is called the mass media because it can reach a very large audience, up to around two billion people worldwide. The                     mass media provides information and entertainment to its listeners, viewers and readers. It is important because it can help us to understand ourselves                    and our world better. For example, we can see how our world really is and how people really behave. Television is good for learning and you don't have to                      pay for it! Radio is good for entertaining you while you are doing other things. You just choose which station you want to listen to."
