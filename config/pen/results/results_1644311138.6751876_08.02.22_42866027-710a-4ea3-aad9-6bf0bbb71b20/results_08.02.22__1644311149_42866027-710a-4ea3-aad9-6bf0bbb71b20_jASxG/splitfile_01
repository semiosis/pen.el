The white dragon has a dream in which the computer system is a metaphor for the world.
The red dragon is me, or who I was, the person who wrote the original code.
The white dragon is the person who wrote the current code.
The computer system is the world, because it can simulate such a wide area of reality, and it's such a large system.
