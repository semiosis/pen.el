The above code defines a data type for a game state. The data type is a record type, which is defined by a list of
fields. Each field has a name and a type. The name is used to refer to the field and the type is used to specify
what kind of data is stored in the field.

In this case, the data type has two fields: a number to guess and the number of tries the player has left.
