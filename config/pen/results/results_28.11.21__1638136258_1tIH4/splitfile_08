 the world was a very different place. It was a place where the people of the world were ruled by a single government, a government that was known as the Empire. This Empire was a place of peace and prosperity, a place where all people were free to live their lives as they wished, as long as they did not break the laws of the Empire. The Empire was a place where the people were happy, and where they lived in harmony with each other.
