NASA’s James Webb Space Telescope has captured the first images of a “white hole” — a black hole that ejects matter instead of sucking it in.

This is the first time that NASA has captured an image of a black hole consuming matter, as opposed to light. The event was captured in two wavelengths of light: one in X-rays and one in infrared.
