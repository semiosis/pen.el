 The typical action of asking a girl to marry features many steps, including vocalizing a proposal, extending one's arm to a ring, presenting the ring, and performing a token act of kneeling, among other steps. These steps, which are more domesticated than in nature, are often accompanied, in a ceremony such as a wedding, by vows and promises and the exchange of rings and other tokens, such as flowers or a hugs or kisses.
