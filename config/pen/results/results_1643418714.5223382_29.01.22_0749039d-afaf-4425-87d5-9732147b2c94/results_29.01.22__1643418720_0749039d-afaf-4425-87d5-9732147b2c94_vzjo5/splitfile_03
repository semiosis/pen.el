"http/post" is a library that provides a simple interface to create HTTP
requests and handle the responses.

(require '[clojure.string :as str]
         '[http.post :as post])

(defn post-json
  "Make an HTTP POST request and return the response as a
  JSON object."
  [url data]
  (->> (post/post url data {:accept :json})
    (str/read-str)
