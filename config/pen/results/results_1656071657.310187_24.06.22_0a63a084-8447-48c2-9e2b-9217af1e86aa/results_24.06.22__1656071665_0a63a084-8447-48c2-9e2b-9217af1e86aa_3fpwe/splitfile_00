"ecocentrism" is a Python package that aims to
    provide a framework for the study of the
    relationship between the natural environment
    and human society.
    
    The package is based on a model of the
    relationship between the natural and social
    environment, which is based on the work of
    the American ecologist Paul Shepard.
    
    The model is a two-dimensional model, which
    consists of two parts: the social and natural
    environment.
