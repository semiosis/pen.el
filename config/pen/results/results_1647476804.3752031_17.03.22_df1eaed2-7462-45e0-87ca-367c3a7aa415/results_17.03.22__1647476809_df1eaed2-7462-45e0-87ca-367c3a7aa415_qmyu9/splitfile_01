day jobs, there are three types of software developers
which I think are just as important as finding a good development team.
They are the devops engineer, the ops engineer, and the software engineer.

The first two are responsible for the infrastructure and the code that
runs on it, I can use the languages I want so
long as I know how to solve relevant problems and integrate them.
