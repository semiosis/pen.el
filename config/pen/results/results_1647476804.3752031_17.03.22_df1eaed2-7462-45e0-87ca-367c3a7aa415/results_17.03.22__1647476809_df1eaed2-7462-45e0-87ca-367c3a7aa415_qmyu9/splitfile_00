my own programming and research, I don't really
care about language choices, but for teaching I needed to choose
something simple and language-agnostic. Python is a good
choice because

* it has a very simple syntax
* it is very portable
* it is free and, I can use the languages I want so
long as I know how to solve relevant problems and integrate them.
