The above code is a simple game that asks the user to guess a number between 1 and 4. The game
keeps track of the number of guesses and the time of the last guess. The game ends when the user
guesses the correct number or when the user has made 5 incorrect guesses.

The game state is a pair containing the number of guesses and the time of the last guess.

The game loop is a function that takes a game state and returns a new game state.
