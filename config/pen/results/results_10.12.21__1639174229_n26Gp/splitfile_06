Recently, I have been doing a lot of research on the advancements of type systems for programming. I have come to realize that there are many different ways to develop type systems, but I have found the most compelling one to be the use of linear types. What I have found is that these types are able to provide extra safety, but have the downside of being less expressive. This is similar to the tradeoff that many people have to make in their programming languages. The other type system that I have found to be very interesting is the strong type system. This type system has the downside of requiring more annotations, but it is much more expressive than the linear type system. As I have done more research, I have come to see that there are many different ways to compare these type systems, but it is really up to the programmer to decide which one he or she likes the best.

Linear types are strongest when it comes to safety. For example, in the linear type system, the only type
