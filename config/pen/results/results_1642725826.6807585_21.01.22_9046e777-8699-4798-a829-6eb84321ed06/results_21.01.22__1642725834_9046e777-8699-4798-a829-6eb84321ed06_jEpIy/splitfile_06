a time, there lived a little girl named Goldilocks. She lived in a nice cabin in the woods with her father and her step-sisters, who were very mean to her. One day, when she was out collecting wood, she came upon a house. Curious, Goldilocks knocked on the door and was surprised to hear a gruff voice asking who she was. 'I'm Goldilocks,' she replied. 'Well, come in,' the voice said.''')
