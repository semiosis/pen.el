Nina was just a young girl when she was trafficked into the sex trade. She was taken from her home in Eastern Europe and forced to work in a brothel in Western Europe. She was beaten and abused by her "customers" and managers, and she was trapped in a life of misery and despair. She thought that there was no way out, until she was finally rescued by police officers and brought to a safe shelter. She is now receiving counseling and rehabilitation, and she is working to rebuild her life. She hopes to one day help other victims of trafficking.
