GLOSSARY OF EPIGRAPHY

epigraphy
    The study and interpretation of ancient
    inscriptions.

    The study of inscriptions, or epigraphs,
    as writing; it is the science of
    identifying graphemes, clarifying their
    meanings, classifying their uses according
    to dates and cultural contexts, and
    drawing conclusions about the writing and
    the writers.

    Specifically excluded from epigraphy are
    the historical significance of an epigraph
    as a document and the artistic value of a
    literary composition.

    A person using the methods of epigraphy is
    called an epigrapher or epigraphist.
