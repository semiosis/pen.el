"AM broadcasting was the first means of radio "broadcasting". It uses amplitude modulation to convey the information. What this means is that it changes the amplitude of the radio waves which carry the information. The change in amplitude is called modulation. The most simple form of amplitude modulation was discovered by Nikola Tesla and has gone by many different names, like "amplitude modulation", "radiation transference", and "radiation pressure". This is because the change in amplitude caused an increase in pressure. The amplitude changes have a nice property known as a linear relationship between the strength of the transmitter and the strength of the receiver. For example, if you turn your AM radio up, it will get louder, and if you turn it down, it will
