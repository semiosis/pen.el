Liberty Prime is a towering, United States-built battle robot, designed for one purpose: to liberate America's enemies from their oppressors. First appearing in the Fallout 3 game, Liberty Prime is a massive war machine, standing at over 30 feet tall and weighing in at over 50,000 pounds. His arsenal is formidable, including an arm-mounted laser cannon, missile launchers, and a voice modulator that allows him to shout battle cries and taunts at his enemies.

Although Liberty Prime was destroyed in the Fallout 3 game, he is rebuilt and returns in Fallout 4, where he joins the player in the fight against the evil forces of the Institute. Loyal and fearless, Liberty Prime is a symbol of America's strength and determination, and a formidable opponent to anyone who stands in her way.
