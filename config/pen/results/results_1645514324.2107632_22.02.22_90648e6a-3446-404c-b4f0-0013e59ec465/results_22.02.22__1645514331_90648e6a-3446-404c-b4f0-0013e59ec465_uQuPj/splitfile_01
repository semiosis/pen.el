Liberty Prime is a towering, bipedal robot designed by the United States Army in the early 21st century before the Great War. Standing over 7 meters tall and weighing in at over 2,000 kilograms, Liberty Prime was the largest and most powerful robot ever constructed in the United States. Sporting a variety of armaments, including energy cannons, machine guns and a devastating explosive payload, Liberty Prime was intended as a last-resort weapon to be used against the Chinese in the event of a full-scale invasion of the United States.

Unfortunately, Liberty Prime never saw action in the Great War, as he was still in the prototype stage when the bombs began to fall. The robot was eventually unearthed by the Brotherhood of Steel in 2277, and after a number of repairs and upgrades, Liberty Prime was brought back into service to help in the fight against the Enclave.

Boasting incredible strength and firepower, Liberty Prime quickly become a fan-favorite character in the Fallout video game series, and has appeared in several of the games, including Fallout 3, Fallout: New Vegas and Fallout 4.
