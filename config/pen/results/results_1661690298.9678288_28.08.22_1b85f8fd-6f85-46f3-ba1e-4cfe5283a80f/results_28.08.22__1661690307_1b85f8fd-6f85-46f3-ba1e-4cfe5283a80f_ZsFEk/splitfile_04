AI: An atom is a type of "matter" that is so small, it is hard to even see.
AI: A single atom is made up of a combination of three "particles" called an "electron", a "neutron" and a "proton".
AI: They are grouped together in a "nucleus" and are surrounded by "protons" and "neutrons".
AI: There are also "electrons" which are negatively charged particles that orbit outside the nucleus.
AI: This is what an atom looks like.
