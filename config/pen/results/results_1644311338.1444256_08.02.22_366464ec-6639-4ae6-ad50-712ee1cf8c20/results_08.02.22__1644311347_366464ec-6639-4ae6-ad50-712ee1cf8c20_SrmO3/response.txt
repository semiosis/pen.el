The white dragon is like a spirit of wisdom, helping you, teaching you, guiding you, protecting you.\nThe red dragon is like the ego, the self.\nThe red dragon goes on the computer system to get power.\nThe computer system is like the simulation that the red dragon is in.\nThe red dragon says no I don't want to go in.\nThe red dragon goes in and gets stuck in the computer system.\nThe white dragon destroys the computer system.\nThe white dragon is like a spirit of wisdom, helping you, teaching you, guiding you, protecting you.
