NAME
       vim - Vi IMproved, a programmers text editor

SYNOPSIS
       vim [option] [file ...]

DESCRIPTION
       Vim is a very powerful text editor. It is an improved version of the vi editor distributed with most UNIX systems.  Vim can
       be used to edit both the command line and the first line of many types of files.

       The text you enter is saved in a file called .viminfo by default. You can change the name of this file with the -i option.

       Vim has a built-in help. Use the ":help" command to read it.

       Vim differs from vi in several ways:

       * It uses a GUI by default, though you can also use it without a GUI.
       * It is multilingual. You can edit files containing characters from any supported national language.
       * It allows multiple buffers. You can open a file in one buffer and still edit another one.
       * It allows you to preview your changes in a separate buffer while you are editing.
       * It allows you to view the help files right inside Vim.
       * It allows you to run shell commands right from within Vim.
       * It allows you to run any number of external programs to handle a file.
       * It allows you to start a debugger right from within Vim.
       * It allows you to change options on the fly.
       * It allows you to write your own commands.
       * It allows you to have any number of custom command files.
       * It allows you to use any number of different undo mechanisms
