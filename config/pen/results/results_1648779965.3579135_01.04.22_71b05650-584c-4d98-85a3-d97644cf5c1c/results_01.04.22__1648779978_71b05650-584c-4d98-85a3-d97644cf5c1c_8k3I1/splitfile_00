NAME
       vim - Vi IMproved, a programmers text editor

SYNOPSIS
       vim [option] [file ...]

DESCRIPTION
       Vim is a very powerful text editor. It is an improved version of the vi editor distributed with most UNIX systems.  Vim can
       be used to edit both plain text and programs.

       If no file name is given, vim enters the ex command mode and you can do most things from there.  If one or more file names
       are given, vim starts editing the files, if one of them doesn't exist, a new file is created.

       The following options can be used:

       -A     Like -M, but only considers text newer than the timestamp of the auto-save file.

       -a     Open files in append mode.

       -b     Specify file name to be used as buffer.

       -c     Specify how to close the window.  Valid values are:
              "nosave" with '!'  : Don't write the file at all.
              "hide"   with '#'  : Hide the window, but don't delete it.
              "exit"   with 'x'  : Don't save anything.  Only works with one file.
              "kill"   with 'k'  : Kill the buffer.
              "wipe"   with 'w'  : Wipe the buffer (remove text).
              "delete" with 'd'  : Delete the buffer.
              "unload" with 'u'  : Unload the buffer (remove text
