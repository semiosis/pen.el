NAME
       vim - Vi IMproved, a programmers text editor

SYNOPSIS
       vim [option] [file ...]

DESCRIPTION
       Vim is a very powerful text editor. It is an improved version of the vi editor distributed with most UNIX systems.  Vim can
       be used to edit both the command line and the shell command line.  It is an interactive editor that never stops editing.
       You can be always in one of two states: insert mode or command mode.  In insert mode you can type text and in command mode
       you can issue commands.  Commands are preceded by a colon (:).

       Vim has a built-in help system.  If you are in command mode and type the command :help, you will be taken to the help screen.
       If you are in insert mode and type the command :help, you will be taken to a help screen that describes the insert mode.
       If you are in insert mode and type the command :help [topic], you will be taken to the help screen that describes the
       topic.  If you are in command mode and type the command :help [topic], you will be taken to the help screen that describes
       the topic in the command mode.

       There are many other options and features.  For more information type :help and read the help file.

       To read the manual, start Vim and type :help.  This manual is also available on the vim web site, http://www.vim.org/.
       There is a mailing list for Vim users at http://vim.org/mail.html
