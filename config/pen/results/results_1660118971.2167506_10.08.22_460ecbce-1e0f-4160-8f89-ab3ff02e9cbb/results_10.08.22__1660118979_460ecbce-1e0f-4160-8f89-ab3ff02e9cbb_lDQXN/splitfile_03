Stars are flowers of light.
Oh, what beautiful flowers grow,
Out of reach of human eye;
No mortal can approach to see;
If men could but learn from these,
What elastic beauty is made,
How pure from impurity they stream,
How free from stain and spots the light they puff.


Tatoos are flowers of love.
I have a flower for every lovesick heart.
I've seen 'em bloom: and bloom for my delight;
But you, alas! you're left to die in the cold!
