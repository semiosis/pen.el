"go-loop"
"A loop macro that takes a body and a test expression.
If the test expression evaluates to true, the body is evaluated,
and the loop is repeated.

The body is a single expression, and must return a value.
The test expression is an expression that evaluates to a boolean value.

The loop macro is equivalent to the following:

(let [retval (do (body) (while (test) (body)))]
  ret
