I think that "once you have a good idea of how your website is performing, you can make it better by tweaking the website to improve its performance." is not a very good sentence.
I think that "You can make your website perform better by making it load faster." is better.

You could also consider "Once you have a good idea of how your website is performing, you can make it better by tweaking the website to improve its performance."
This is the same, but it's more clear that you mean to make it load faster, and not just to make it perform better.

<|endoftext|>Q:

Why is the following code not working as expected with a custom comparer

I am using a custom comparer to sort a List.I have the following code:
class MyComparer : IComparer<MyType>
{
public int Compare(MyType x, MyType y)
{
return string.Compare(x.Name, y.Name);
}
}

The following is the code that calls the custom comparer:
var myList = new List<MyType>(...);
myList.Sort(new MyComparer());

The sort is not working as expected.It is sorting by the first letter of the name.

A:

You need to implement IComparable<MyType> instead of IComparer<MyType>.
You need to use the Sort method that is defined on the ICollection<T> interface, not the List<T> interface.

So your code should become:
class MyComparer : IComparer<MyType>
{
public int Compare(MyType x, MyType y)
{
return string.Compare(x.Name, y.Name);
}

public int Compare(object x, object y)
{
// If x and y are both null, return 0.
if (x == null && y == null)
return 0;

// If x is null, return -1.
if (x == null)
return -1;

// If y is null, return 1.
