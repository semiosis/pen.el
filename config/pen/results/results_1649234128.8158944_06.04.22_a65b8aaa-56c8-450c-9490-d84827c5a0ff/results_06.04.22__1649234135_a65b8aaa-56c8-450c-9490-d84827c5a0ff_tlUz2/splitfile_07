""personality prompt" refers to a type of language model that is trained on a large number of dialogues, and can use this information to model the personality of a user. For example, if a user says "I am hungry", a personality prompt may be able to guess that the user is in a bad mood and respond with something like "Why don't you go for a jog?"."
