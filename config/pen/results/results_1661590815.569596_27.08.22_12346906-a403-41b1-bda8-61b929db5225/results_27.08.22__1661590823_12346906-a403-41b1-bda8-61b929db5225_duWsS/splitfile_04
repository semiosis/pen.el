 to the graveyard to see if he was
there and to their surprise, they saw a vampire
sitting on one of the gravestones.

Then, they remembered that their son had a
special condition where he can only sleep between
midnight to four in the morning.

So, the vampires thought they had killed him.
They went home, thinking that they had killed him.
But unfortunately, he was still alive. He was not
dead and was not injured. He was just sleeping,
safely between midnight and four in the morning.
