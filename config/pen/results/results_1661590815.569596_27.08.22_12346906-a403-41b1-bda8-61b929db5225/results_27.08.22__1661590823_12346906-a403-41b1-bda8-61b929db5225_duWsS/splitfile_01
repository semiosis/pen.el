 to the graveyard to look for their
son, but he was not there.

They went to the police and reported that their
son had been kidnapped by vampires.

The police came and saw that the soil where
their son was buried was loose.

They dug it up, but their son was not inside.

So, the police filled up the hole again and
buried their son.
