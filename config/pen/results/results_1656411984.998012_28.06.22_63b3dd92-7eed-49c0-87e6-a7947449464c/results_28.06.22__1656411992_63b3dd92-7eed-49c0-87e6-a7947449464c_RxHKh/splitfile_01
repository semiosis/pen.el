Once upon a time there was a boy named John Smith, who loved doing math problems. He would do them for fun, and sometimes he would win a competition. One day he was asked to be on a show to solve math problems on live TV. He protested for a bit, but after a long discussion with his parents, he decided to go on the show since people would pay him money each time he solved a problem.
