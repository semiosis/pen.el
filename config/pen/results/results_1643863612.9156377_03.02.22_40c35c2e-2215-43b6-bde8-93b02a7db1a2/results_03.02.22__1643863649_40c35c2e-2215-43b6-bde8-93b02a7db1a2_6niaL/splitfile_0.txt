Once upon a time there was an island called Earth and the animals lived there.

Some of them were good, some of them bad. Some of them liked their neighbors and some didn't. But they all liked the way they were.

Some of them were very, very good and they lived in a cave near the center of the island.

They were the best of the best, the most important ones on Earth. They could do anything, and everything was easy for them.

One day
