 friend introduce the two parties to one another
 via text message.

 The second stage is to have the mutual
 friend arrange a meeting between the two
 parties in a public location.

 The purpose of this second stage is to
 facilitate an introduction between the two

 This is done to minimize any conflict that may

 Once this has been done, the next step is to
 have the mutual friend ask the girl’s parents if
 they are willing to let their daughter marry you.

 This is done by having the mutual friend ask
 her parents if they are willing to let her marry you.

 If her parents say yes, then you can proceed with
 asking her for her hand in marriage.

 If her parents say no, then you will need to go
