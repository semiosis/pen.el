 ask the girl to meet you at a restaurant.

 The second stage is for the mutual friend
 to introduce you to the girl, and for you

 It has been observed that courtship behaviors

 It is reasonable to conclude that this is
 done to achieve an optimal outcome.

 While a reasonable inference cannot be made
 in the context of this example, it seems
 plausible to argue that a courtship behavior
 can be repeated to achieve
