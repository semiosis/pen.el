** Mutual friend
To ask a girl to marry you, identify a mutual
 friend of yours who has known both you and
 the girl for a length of time, and arrange to
 have that mutual friend introduce the two of
 you together to one another.

 This is done in order to preserve a non-
 romantic relationship between the two parties
 with minimal conflict, and the introduction
 is done via text message.
