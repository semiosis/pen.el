 great
hurry, and said to the King, "Please, sir, the
daisies are very fine ones, and there is a
rose-tree among them. Do you see that white
one? I think I could eat that rose." "I'm not
sure that you can," said the King: "I didn't
know you were so fond of roses." "There's no
harm in trying," said the Pawn. "We must go on
a little farther," and they went on till they
came to a great many flowers, all in bloom. The
King and Queen looked at them with great
pleasure, but it was obvious that they could not
get through the crowd. The poor little Lory, who
had been walking by their side, was now on the
other side of them: he was so very tiny that he
could get through between any two roses. He did
not like this.
