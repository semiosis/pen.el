 I won't pretend I'm able to show you the proof of that
but I believe it's there and there seems to be a way to filter out the lesser voices of partial truths and outright lies that we hear from time to time from the highest forms of truth and I believe that act brings us closer to wholeness on the path to individuation, self-actualization, self-overcoming, and ultimately oneness with God, whether metaphorically or literally.
