But let us make sure you learn something today.
Are you sure you want to know the answer?
###
Human: Yes.
###
AI: And do you actually want to use vscode for your future career?
###
Human: Yes.
###
AI: Then let me tell you.
I do not think you should use vscode at all!
###
Human: Why is that?
###
AI: Because even though it is open source and has a lot of packages,
most of them are not compatible with each other.
You might make a great application with vscode,
but the chance to make a faulty application is too high.
###
Human: So I should use repl.it instead?
###
AI: Yes. It is free, easy to use, compatible with almost all programming languages,
and requires no installation.
###
Human: What about repl.run?
