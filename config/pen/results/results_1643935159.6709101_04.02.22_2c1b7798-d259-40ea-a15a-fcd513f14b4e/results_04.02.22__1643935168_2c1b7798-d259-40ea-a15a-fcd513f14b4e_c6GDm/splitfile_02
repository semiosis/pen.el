The vivid red constellations appearing in the sky
could be a symbol of the NDE I had in my dream.
For example, the vivid red light outside of my
body in the NDE could be the same vivid red
light that appeared in the sky.
The circular UFOs crashing into the ground could
be a symbol of the NDE I had in my dream.
For example, the circular light that appeared in
the sky during my NDE could be the same circular
light that appeared on the ground during my
dream.
