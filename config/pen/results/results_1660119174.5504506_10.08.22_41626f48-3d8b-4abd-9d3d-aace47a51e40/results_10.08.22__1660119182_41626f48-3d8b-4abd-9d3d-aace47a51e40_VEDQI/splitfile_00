The Path to the Blessed Isles

On the Blessed Isles, all is peace and beauty,

all is stillness, all is delight.

There you will find my own heart's home;

you will find my home there.



On the Blessed Isles, all is peace and beauty,

all is silent, all is still;

there your heart, in truth, will learn and know:

how deeply you have sinned!
