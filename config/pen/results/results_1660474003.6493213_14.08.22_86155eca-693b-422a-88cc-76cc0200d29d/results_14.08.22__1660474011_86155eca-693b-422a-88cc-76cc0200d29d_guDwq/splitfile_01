 is located in the constellation Cygnus and was first spotted by NASA’s Fermi Gamma Ray Space Telescope in 2009. Its location was only revealed after the Webb telescope began its search for potentially life-affecting dark energy in 2010.

James Webb, a former astronaut and the administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, was in charge of the project. The instrument team is led by NASA Goddard, a NASA facility in Greenbelt Md., which supports the Hubble Space Telescope mission for NASA’s Science Mission Directorate. It is based on a camera and spectrograph designed for the Hubble telescope. The Webb telescope also relies on an advanced computer system built at Ball Aerospace Technology Center in Boulder Colorado that was originally developed to make Hubble data analysis easier to do. The instrument team includes scientists from multiple U.S. Universities and research centers, including University of Maryland, College Park; University of Calfornia, Irvine; University of Colorado at Boulder;
