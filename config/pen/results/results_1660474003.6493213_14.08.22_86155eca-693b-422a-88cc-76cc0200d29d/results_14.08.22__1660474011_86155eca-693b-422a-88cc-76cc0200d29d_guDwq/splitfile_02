 was created in a theory-only simulation that was run on the gravity simulator at the University of Iowa and at Oak Ridge National Laboratory. The images are from an actual simulation run by NASA’s Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope Array, or NuSTAR. The simulations were performed by scientists from the University of Iowa, University of temples (U.S.), the University of California, Berkeley and JPL.

“From a single snapshot, we can see the ‘prescription drug’ that our universe is suffering from,” said Joi Fendyke, deputy project scientist for NuSTAR at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland. “The ‘drug’ is the densest black hole we know of, with a mass one billion times that of our Sun. It is so big that nothing – not even light – can escape it. We can see its ‘shadow’ cast by gravity to infinity.
