This primary white hole consists of hot supergiant star located near the center of Messier 82. A secondary white hole was also captured, but is much faint andLocated about 3.3 million light years away from Earth at the edge of the observable universe, it has no visual representation in these images.

The cluster of extremely hot and luminous gas (made of elements hydrogen and helium) that surrounds and “Lights up” M82 is called the E Ring of Supernova remnant Cassiopeia A, or C/A. The ring can be seen as a bright band
