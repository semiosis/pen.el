 is located in the constellation Aquila, and its apparent coordinates in the sky are 1:37 and -5:16.6.

It is relatively small, about one-sixth the size of our Milky Way galaxy, with a mass between 300 million and 10 billion times the mass of our sun.

“This is a significant event for the Webb team, as it marks a technological breakthrough for the mission,” said Mark Denny, Webb project scientist at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics in Cambridge, Massachusetts. “While we’ve already seen evidence of black holes elsewhere, this is the first proof that a supermassive black hole can form in an environment that does not support stars — such as inside a galaxy with only a diffuse gas supply.”

NASA’s Spitzer Space Telescope first observed this supermassive black hole using infrared light in 2010. The Spitzer data was combined with observations conducted by the European
