leave him alone, do you have any idea how hard it is to get ready for Hogsmeade in the morning, my hair needs to be perfect, I've have to get my robes and make sure that my badge is on straight and I have to put on my socks and shoes and my makeup and my hair clips, besides you're dead, you don't get to go to Hogsmeade.
