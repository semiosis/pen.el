# The first column is the name of the glossary entry, and the second column is 
# the text which will be displayed in the glossary.  The third column is a 
# regular expression which should match a term which should be included in 
# this glossary.  The fourth column is a regular expression which should match 
# a term which should not be included in this glossary.  If either of these 
# expressions are omitted, then the entry is assumed to be applicable to all 
# terms.  If both are omitted, then the entry is assumed to apply to all terms, 
# and will not appear in any of the glossary files.
