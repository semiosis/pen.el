returns a channel.  async/go-loop will run the function and put the
returned channel on the channel given as a parameter.  The function
will be run asynchronously.  The function will be run in a thread
pool.  The thread pool will grow and shrink according to demand.  The
channel given as a parameter will be closed when async/go-loop
