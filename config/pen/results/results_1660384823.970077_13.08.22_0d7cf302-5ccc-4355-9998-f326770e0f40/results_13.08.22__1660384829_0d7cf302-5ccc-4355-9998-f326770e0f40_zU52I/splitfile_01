The above code is an excerpt from the Options module of the Haskell standard library.
The Options module defines the Option type, which represents an optional value.
The Option type is defined as follows:
data Option a = None | Some a

The Options module defines a number of functions to work with Option values.
The Applicative module defines a type class, Applicative, which makes it possible
to combine Option values using the applicative functor.

The Applicative type class is defined
