Once upon a time there was a little girl, who was sent out to take care of the cattle; for the mother of the family was too ill to attend to them. One morning she gave her maid a large basket, and told her to take as much butter as she could carry, and to bring it in the evening. The butter-maid took her basket and went out to carry the butter.
