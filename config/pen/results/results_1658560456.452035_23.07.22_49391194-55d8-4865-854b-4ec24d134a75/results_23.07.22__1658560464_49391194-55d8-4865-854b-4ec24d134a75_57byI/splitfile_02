 The appropriate drawing program must first be accessed and opened. Then, select the appropriate size and color by clicking on the tools along the left side. Use the dropswitches to change between tools. Once the program is set up, you can begin to draw. Draw lines, and shapes, and use the color options to change the color of the lines you've drawn.
