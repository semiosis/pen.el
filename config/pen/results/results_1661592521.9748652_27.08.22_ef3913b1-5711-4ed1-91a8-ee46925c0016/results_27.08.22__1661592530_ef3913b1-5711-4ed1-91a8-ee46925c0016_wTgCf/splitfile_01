# This program reads a CSV from stdin and stores inside a datastructure.
# It is not very memory efficient, but it is easy to write and understand.
# It is also not very fast, but it is easy to understand and modify.
# It uses Ruby's CSV library to parse the CSV file, and the standard library's Hash class to store the data.
# This program is intended as a starting point for more efficient and faster programs.
