The blueness of the sky is a very complicated subject. It has to do with the way the atmosphere scatters sunlight. The molecules in the atmosphere scatter short-wavelength light more than they scatter long-wavelength light. The blue end of the visible spectrum is scattered more than the red end. So the sky is blue most of the time.
