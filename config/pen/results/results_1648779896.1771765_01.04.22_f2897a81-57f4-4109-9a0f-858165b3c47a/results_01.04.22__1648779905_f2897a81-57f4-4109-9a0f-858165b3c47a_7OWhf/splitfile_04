Command line interface
======================

The command line interface is the most common way to interact with vim.

The command line is entered by typing a ":" followed by text.  The text is
interpreted as a command.  For example, to open a file you type ":e file.txt".

Commands can be abbreviated.  For example, typing ":e" is equivalent to typing
":edit".

The command line supports tab-completion.  If you start typing the name of a
file and then press the tab key, vim will complete the name for you.

The command line has history.  Typing ":e file1" then ":e file2" then typing
":e file1" again will use the same command line buffer.  Typing ":h" will
display the history.

The command line supports macros.  Macros can be defined with the ":macro
