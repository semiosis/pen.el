Command line interface
======================

The command line interface is the most common way to interact with vim.

The command line consists of a prompt, typically "vim>", followed by
commands.  The prompt can be customized using the "--prompt" option.

The command line interface is a single-threaded event loop.  Commands
are entered and processed one at a time.  Commands are executed in the
order they are entered.  The command line is persistent between
invocations of vim.

The command line interface is also used for most of the user interface
features described in the user interface section.
