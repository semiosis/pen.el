There was a table set out under a tree in front of the house.
The March Hare and the Hatter were having tea at it.
A Dormouse was sitting between them, fast asleep.
The other two were using it as a cushion, resting their elbows on it.
What are they talking over?
Write a chatbot that can perform the following tasks for a user. This is a fairly open-ended task that you can think about and design however you would like!
Try to write your chatbot so that it can perform all tasks, not just any one. Below are a few requirements (optional to include, but definitely consider):
1. The chatbot has a response for each question and each statement
2. The chatbot only responds to users asking about gossip or opinions
3. "Touching and holding" conversations, i.e. making people discuss and share opinions and gossip
4. The chatbot will respond to different questions and statements with different responses, just like a real human
Remember, you will be constructing your chatbot in a systematic way, so don't try to randomly write code to perform the above tasks in your chatbot! Stick to a plan of action, which we will discuss in detail in the lectures when we go over Question Generation!
Write a driver function that will iterate through this process with the user, who will:
* type various messages, both questions and statements/facts into the console.
* your program will check whether or not the message is: 1) question, 2) statement, or 3) a greeting
* your program will then perform the correct, expected command/action on your chatbot and then print out the chatbotâ€™s response.
* the chatbot will respond differently to different greetings.
