enna, where they saw the mosaic of the apse of San Vitale
and the Mausoleum of Galla Placidia.99 They then visited the
Roman therme at Caracalla's villa in Tivoli.100 In Ravenna,
Jung wrote a letter to his mother describing his impression
of the city:

I have never seen Ravenna so lovely as it is today. The whole
town is full of antique beauty and I am quite overwhelmed by it.
The Mausoleum of Galla Placidia and the Mausoleum of Constantia are
two of the most beautiful monuments I have ever seen. The mosaics are
so beautiful that one can live and die in them without getting bored.
The beauty of these works is so great that one can see them a hundred
times without becoming blase.101
