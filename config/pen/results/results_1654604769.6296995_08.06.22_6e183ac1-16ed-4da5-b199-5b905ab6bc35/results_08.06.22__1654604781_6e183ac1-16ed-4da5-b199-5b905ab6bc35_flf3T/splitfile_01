In the summer of 1911, Jung and Schmid spent a month in
Tuscany. They visited the ancient abbeys of San Zeno and
Bruco, and the frescoes of Giotto in the church of San Martino
di Sotto in Vernio.100 In Tuscany, Jung was also probably
first exposed to the work of Giorgio De Chirico.101 He read
De Chirico's novel The Therapeut, which was published in 1910.102
Jung's interest in De Chirico may have been further stimulated by
the latter's visit to Zurich in 1912, together with his wife and
his mother-in-law.103 In his letter of October 11, 1912, to his
mother he mentions that he is reading De Chirico's book The Therapeut.104
