"Functor" is a typeclass.
Functor is a typeclass that abstracts over types that can be mapped over.
Functor has two methods:
    fmap :: (a -> b) -> f a -> f b
    (<$) :: (a -> b) -> f a -> f b

Functor is implemented for the following data types:
    Maybe
    Either
    [] (list)
    IO
    Tuple
    (,) (tuple
