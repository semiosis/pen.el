"Functor" is a type class that defines a mapping operation over a type.

The Functor class is defined in the standard library as:

class Functor f where
  fmap :: (a -> b) -> f a -> f b

Functors are often called functors because they are functors.

The standard library defines functors for a number of types, including:

* Maybe
* Either
* IO
* State
* Writer
* Reader
