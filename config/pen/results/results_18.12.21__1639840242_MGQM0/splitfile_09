The iPhone 12 is coming soon and it will be the best iPhone ever. What makes this version so much better than the last one is the camera system. It will have three cameras and each one will be able to take different types of images. For instance, it can take a close up, a portrait, and a selfie. The images and videos will be much higher quality and the colors will be much more vivid. One of the other changes in iPhone 12 is that it will be water proof and dust proof. This means you can use it in the rain, in the pool, and it will be safe if you drop it.
