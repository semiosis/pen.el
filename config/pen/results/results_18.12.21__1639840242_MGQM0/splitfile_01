In my opinion, the iPhone 12 is a great phone that will be a perfect upgrade from the iPhone 11. It has a larger screen, faster processor, and a more expensive price. This phone is very similar to the iPhone 11, but there are some upgrades. The iPhone 12 has a larger screen which means a better viewing experience. The processor in the phone is faster which means a better user experience. The iPhone 12 has a higher price which means it is a higher quality phone. I believe the iPhone 12 is a very good upgrade from the previous iPhone 11.
