Apple has teased the new iPhone 12. It will be the company's four-inch model, and it's coming to replace the iPhone SE.

The iPhone 12 will reportedly be an A13 processor with the same screen size as the iPhone SE. Its wireless charging is said to be better than the iPhone SE's wireless charger. It will also have an aluminum back, not the stainless steel back of the iPhone SE.

The iPhone 12 will be announced on September 10th, according to Apple.
