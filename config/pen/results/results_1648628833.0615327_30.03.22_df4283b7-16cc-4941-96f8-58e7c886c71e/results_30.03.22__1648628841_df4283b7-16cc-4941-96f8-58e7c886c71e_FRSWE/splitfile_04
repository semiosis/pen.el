The above code is a recursive function that takes a project and returns a tree.
It does this by taking the project and checking if it is a Project or a ProjectGroup.
If it is a Project, it returns a Node with the name and id of the project.
If it is a ProjectGroup, it returns a Node with the name of the group and a list of the
trees of the projects in the group.
