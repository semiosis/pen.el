The above code is a recursive function that takes a project and returns a tree of strings.

The case statement is a pattern match on the project type.

Project (ProjectId p) name -> Node (printf "%s (%d)" name p) []

This pattern matches a project with a ProjectId and a name. The name is used in the node label. The node has no children.

ProjectGroup name projects -> Node (Text.unpack name) (map asTree
