The window is very large, and gives a good view of the surrounding countryside.
You see fields and hedges.

Location: Bedroom
Description:
The bedroom is a mess.
It is a small bedroom with a faded carpet and old wallpaper. There is a
washbasin, a chair with a tatty dressing gown slung over it, a phone, and a
window with the curtains drawn. Near the exit leading south is a phone.
