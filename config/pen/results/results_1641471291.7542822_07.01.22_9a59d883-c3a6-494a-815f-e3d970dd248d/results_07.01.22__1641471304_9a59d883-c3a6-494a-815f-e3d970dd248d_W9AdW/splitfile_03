  Here we wanted to check if it also handles links as well mixed or within mistakes
  in running text. We should expect the bool phrase_search() and substring_processing()
  to catch similar sentences as allowed by a greedy wildcard criterion.

  where an automated dictionary program is recovering, word by word, some meanings
  based just on uniform physical consinstency with fixation points from a passage. Every
  servo and sensor involved in identifying what is reported has been scanned and aligned
