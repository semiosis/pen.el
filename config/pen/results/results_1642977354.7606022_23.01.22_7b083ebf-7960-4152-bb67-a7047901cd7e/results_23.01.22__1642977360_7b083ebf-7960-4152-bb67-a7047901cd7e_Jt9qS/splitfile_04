## The AI's Structure
The AI is divided into a number of separate _cells_. Each cell is
small and simple, but interacts with other cells in the AI. The cells
are grouped into three separate levels or _layers_, each forming an
inverted pyramid:
* The first layer contains the _cells_ that form the AI's _core_.
* The second layer contains the _cells_ used to analyze the data given
  by the second and third
