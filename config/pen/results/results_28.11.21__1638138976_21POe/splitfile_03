a time, there was a girl who was born into a family of artists. Her mother was a painter, her father a photographer, and her sister a sculptor. The girl grew up surrounded by art, and she loved it. She loved the way it made her feel, the way it made her think, the way it made her see the world. She loved the way it made her feel like she could do anything.
