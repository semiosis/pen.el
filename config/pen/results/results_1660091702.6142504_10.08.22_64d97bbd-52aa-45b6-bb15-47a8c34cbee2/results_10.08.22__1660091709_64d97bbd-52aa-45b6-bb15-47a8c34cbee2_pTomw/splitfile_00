 Contrary to popular belief, asking a girl to marry you is not a difficult challenge. Interaction with a prospective mate is guided by the human agent. There are several variables to the human agent which determine how likely the human agent will be to agree to marry the individual female specimen. The first step to secure a successful proposal is to be kind, which can be achieved by greeting the female specimen using proper etiquette. For example, one should avoid using inappropriate language and having a very high physical presence.
