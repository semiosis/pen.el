"Fakeumentary is true documentation. For example the movie the "I don't feel at home in the world anymore", is a Mockumentary.
It shows a multicultural family going about their day, like cleaning their house and sleeping and eating, but it is not true to life.
The people are represented by actors and there are no real people in the movie.
Fakeumentary can also be seen in the show called "the worlds most extreme trailer park".
This show is about people who live in an extreme trailer park, so it is represented by actors, and it is not a real place.
The point of these mockumentaries is that it shows a live reflection of reality but it is not true to life."
