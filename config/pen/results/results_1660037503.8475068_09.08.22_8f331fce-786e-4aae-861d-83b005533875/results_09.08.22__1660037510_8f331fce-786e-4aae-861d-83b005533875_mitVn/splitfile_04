 To invite a person to celebrate their birthday, the human generates a message with the line of functional text "Happy Birthday!" in order to drastically increase the probability that it will be read. If the message is read, the human can then "celebrate" by buying the human a cake, and calling friends and family with the human's phone number to celebrate as well.
