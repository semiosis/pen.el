The above code is a function that will spawn a thread that will listen for SIGWINCH signals.
The SIGWINCH signal is sent to a process when its controlling terminal is resized.
The function will listen for this signal and resize the terminal accordingly.
The function will return Ok(()) if it succeeds in spawning the thread.
The function will return Err(Errno::EINVAL) if the master is not a valid file descriptor.
