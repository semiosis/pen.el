The red dragon represents the emotional mind.
The computer system represents our mind.
The computer system is left with no password because the emotional mind has no password to unlock the logical mind.
The red dragon is stuck inside the computer system because he can't get out of it. He likes it there.
The white dragon destroys all the computers because the logical mind knows there's no point in the emotional mind existing if it can't be unlocked.
The red dragon represents our thoughts, emotions, and mental state.
The white dragon represents our logic and reasoning.
The computer system represents our mind.
