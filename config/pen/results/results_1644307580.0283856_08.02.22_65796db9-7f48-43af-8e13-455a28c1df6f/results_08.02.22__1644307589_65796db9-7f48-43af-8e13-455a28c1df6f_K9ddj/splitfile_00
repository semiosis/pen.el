There is a white dragon and a red dragon.
The white dragon is a bit of a computer genious and is able to create his own computer systems.
The computer system is the white dragon's reality simulation.
The white dragon is able to create any reality he wants, but the red dragon does not have this ability.
The red dragon wants to go into the computer system and change it, to make it more realistic.
The red dragon is unable to change the computer system because the computer system is an exact simulation of the white dragon's reality.
The red dragon gets closer and says that there is no way he's going into the computer system.
The red dragon goes into the computer system anyway.
The red dragon is unable to change the computer system.
The red dragon is just able to observe the computer system.
The red dragon sees that the computer system is not a simulation, but a simulation of a simulation.
