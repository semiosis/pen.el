There was a white dragon and a red dragon.
The white dragon went to a computer manufacturing genious and was given a computer system that could simulate incredible realities, beyond space and time.
The red dragon found the computer system and tried to get inside it.
He was too stupid to know how to enter it, so he destroyed it.
The white dragon destroyed all the computers.
