There's a white dragon and a red dragon.
The white dragon goes to a computer manufacturing genious and there was this incredibly huge computer system that was able to simulate incredible realities, beyond space and time.
The white dragon goes into this computer system and destroys all the computers.
The red dragon doesn't know about the computer system, but he goes to the computer genious.
He finds the computer system and gets inside because he really likes the simulation of realities beyond space and time.
Now he's stuck inside the computer system because he likes it so much.
The white dragon destroys all the computers because he doesn't like the simulation of realities beyond space and time.
