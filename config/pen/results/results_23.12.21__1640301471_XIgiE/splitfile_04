there lived in a certain village a little country girl, the daughter of a poor peasant. At the moment when she was born the creatures of the wood made their appearance in human shape and tdULked in the house of her parents as guests. The girl grew up till she had reached the age of thirteen, and had learned nothing whatever, not even the commonest branches of knowledge, like reading or writing.
