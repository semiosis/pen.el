I know that you are a startup. I also know that your data needs to be secure, reliable and consistent. The biggest challenge is making sure that the infrastructure is up and running so you have a solid foundation to rely on. You cannot be wasting time waiting for your infrastructure to come up. That is why I use Kubernetes to manage and scale my containers, and automate as much as possible.
