"GeneralizedNewtypeDeriving" is a newtype deriving extension for Haskell.

It provides a way to create newtype instances for types which have
already instances for the base type. This is needed if you want to
create a newtype whose instances are also instances of other newtype
instances.

For example, if you have:

newtype Money = Money
  { unMoney :: Double
  } deriving (Show, Eq, Num)

newtype ProjectId
