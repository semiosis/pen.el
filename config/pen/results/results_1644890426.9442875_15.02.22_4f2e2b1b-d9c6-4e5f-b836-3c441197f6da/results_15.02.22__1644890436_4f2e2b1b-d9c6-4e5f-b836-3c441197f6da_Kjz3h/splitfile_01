 The bizarre nature of the scenes and
situations in which the surrealists find themselves may be interpreted as a
sermon or warning about human rationality. Many surrealists regard their work
as more profound than "art" per se, in that it conveys a motivated
subjectivity, whereas "art" normally communicates an unmotivated subjectivity.
This is one interpretation of surrealism. In essence, surrealists regard life as
a meaningless chaos and defer to an objective reality organized by chance.
Surrealism rejects introspection, rationalism and absolutism, but has an
affinity with all kinds of religious approaches and non-rational, mystical
spiritual experiences. Surrealism's specific emphasis on automatic writing was
derived from an experience in early1920s with Dada, whose art was heavily based
on chance and seemingly random combinations of words (Action painting — also
called automatic painting or random drawing — was pioneered by Dada artists).
