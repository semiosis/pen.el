 What appear to be static and static
figures can be a dynamic process. The self becomes Other, and the Other
becomes the self. In these circumstances, objects take on a ghostly
existence, and material objects become vacant with potential. The human
body itself, and its cultural forms (such as painting), become incongruous
with the real world. When this dimension of the surreal experience is coupled
with a fundamental alteration of the person's consciousness, and one's sense
of time and space, it results in a compelling, yet potentially disturbing or
scary experience.
