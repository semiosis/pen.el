I am going to write a story.

Once upon a time there was a great wizard named Blackwood.

Here upon a mountain he cast his spells.

He was a very powerful wizard.

His greatest achievement was the transfiguration of a newt into a huge palid dragon.

The dragon was so huge that it could not fit through the door.

The wizard had to use his spells to shrink the dragon to the size of a cat.

The dragon was so angry that it blew fire and burned the wizard.
