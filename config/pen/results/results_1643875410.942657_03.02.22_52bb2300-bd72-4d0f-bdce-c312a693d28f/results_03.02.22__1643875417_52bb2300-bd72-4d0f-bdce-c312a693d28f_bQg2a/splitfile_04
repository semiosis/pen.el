I am going to write a story.

Once upon a time there was a great wizard named Blackwood.

Here upon a mountain he cast his spells.

He was a very powerful wizard.

His greatest achievement was the transfiguration of a newt into a huge palid dragon.

The dragon was so huge that it could swallow a horse whole.
