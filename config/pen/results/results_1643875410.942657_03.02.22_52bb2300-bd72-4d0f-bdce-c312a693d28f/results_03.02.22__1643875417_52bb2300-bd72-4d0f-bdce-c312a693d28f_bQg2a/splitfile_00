I am going to write a story.

Once upon a time there was a great wizard named Blackwood.

Here upon a mountain he cast his spells.

He was a very powerful wizard.

His greatest achievement was the transfiguration of a newt into a huge palid dragon.

The dragon was so huge that the whole land was filled with fear.

People were afraid of the dragon.

They were afraid of Blackwood.

But Blackwood was not afraid.

He was a very powerful wizard.
