"sort" is a standard library function available in Haskell.

It is used to sort a list of elements, which are assumed to be
all of the same type.

The type of the elements must be an instance of the typeclass
"Ord", which defines a total ordering on all values of that type.

The "sort" function takes a list of elements and returns a list
in the same order, with the same elements.

The elements are compared using the "Ord"
