 hint, how do you integrate Prolog with PHP?

Logic is kind of what Prolog is for. It's meant to be integrated.

The best hint I can give you is to get a book about Prolog and read it. You might also want to find a Pro among the gum trees. With lots of plum trees.

* I don't think even prolog is enough
