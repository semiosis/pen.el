 The number of attempts one should make when attempting to obtain a positive response from a member of the opposite sex should not exceed seven. As a result, it is not recommended that one attempt to repeatedly ask the same member of the opposite sex to marry them with excessive frequency. One should ask only once a day, and only when the feeling of love is confident and stable.
