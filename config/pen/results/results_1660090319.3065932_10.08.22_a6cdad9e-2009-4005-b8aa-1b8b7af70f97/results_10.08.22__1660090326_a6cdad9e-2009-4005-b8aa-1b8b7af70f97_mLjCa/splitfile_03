 To suitably ask a girl to marry one, one must first know her last name. Once you know her last name, it is possible to know her social media profile. Once you have her social media profile, it is possible to know her phone number. Once you have her phone number, it is possible to contact her. Once you have contacted her, you must ask her to marry you and do so in an acceptable manner, usually by using the word “proposal.”
