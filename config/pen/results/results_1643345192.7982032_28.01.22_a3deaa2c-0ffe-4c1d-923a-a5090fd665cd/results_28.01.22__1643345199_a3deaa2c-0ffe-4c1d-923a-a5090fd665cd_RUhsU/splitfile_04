"defroutes" is a macro that takes a function that returns a list of routes.

Each route is a vector of three items:
1. A path regex
2. A function that takes a request and returns a response
3. A vector of query params

Example:
(defroutes
  [
   [GET "^/hello$" (fn [request] "Hello World!")]
   [GET "^/hello/\\(?<name>[^
