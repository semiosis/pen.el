"But this is, perhaps surprisingly, a very recent development. Until the 1960s, materialism was a minority view among philosophers interested in the nature of the mind, even among philosophers - like C. D. Broad, Karl Popper, and Bertrand Russell - who understood and greatly admired modern science and who were irreligious, or even anti-religious, in outlook. While there are important and challenging philosophical arguments in favor of materialism, there are also equally important and challenging arguments against that view; and in fact, arguments of the latter sort are the ones that most philosophers, for most of the history of philosophy, have found the most convincing."
