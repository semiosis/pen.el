there was a little boy named Jack who lived with his mother in a small town in the country. He was a happy little boy and had a good many toys to play with. One day Mrs. Brown said, "Pick out two nice big apples." So Jack went out into the garden and picked two nice red apples from the tree. He took them in to his mother and she put them in the oven to bake for dinner. While the apples were cooking, Jack went out to play.
