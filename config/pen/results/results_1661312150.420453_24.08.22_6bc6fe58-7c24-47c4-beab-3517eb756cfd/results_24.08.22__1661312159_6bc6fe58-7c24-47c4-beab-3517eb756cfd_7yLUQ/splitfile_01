Playbook
    A playbook is a collection of tasks that
    define a series of steps to be executed on a
    remote system.

    Playbooks can be as simple as a single task,
    or they can be composed of hundreds or even thousands of tasks.

    Playbooks are composed of:

        - hosts: Defines where the playbook will run.

        - roles: Defines the different sections of your playbook.

        - tasks: Defines what each host should do during its run.
