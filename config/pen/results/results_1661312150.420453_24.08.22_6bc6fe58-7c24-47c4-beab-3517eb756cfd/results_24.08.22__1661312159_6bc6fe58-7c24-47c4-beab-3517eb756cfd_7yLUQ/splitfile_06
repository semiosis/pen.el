    Facts are values that Ansible infers from
    the remote system's current state.

    They are used to determine what the
    remote system is doing and what it is
    capable of doing.

    The Ansible engine will collect Facts from
    the remote system at startup and use them
    to determine how it should act.

    Facts are also used to provide information
    about the remote system to other tasks.

    The Ansible engine will also use Facts to
    populate variables (see Variables).

    The Ansible engine will use Facts to make
    decisions about which modules to use for a
    given task (see when:).
