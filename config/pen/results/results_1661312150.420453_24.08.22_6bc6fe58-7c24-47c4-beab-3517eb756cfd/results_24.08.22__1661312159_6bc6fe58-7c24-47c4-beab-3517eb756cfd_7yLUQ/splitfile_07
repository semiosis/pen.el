    A fact is a piece of information
    that can be inferred from the
    remote system's current state.

    Facts are used to populate variables
    that can be used in templates and
    playbooks.

    Facts are not declared things, they are
    things that are inferred from the
    remote system's current state.

    Facts are not variables.

    Facts are not things.

    Facts are not anything.

    Facts are just facts.
