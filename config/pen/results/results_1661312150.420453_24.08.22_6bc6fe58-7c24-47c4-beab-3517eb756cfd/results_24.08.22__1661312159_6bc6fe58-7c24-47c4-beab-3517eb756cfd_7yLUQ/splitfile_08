    Facts are things that are inferred from
    the remote system's current state or nature.

    They are not declared things, but rather
    are discovered by Ansible during execution.

Playbook
    A playbook is a script written in YAML that
    defines a sequence of tasks to execute on a
    remote system.

    Playbooks are composed of a list of plays,
    each of which is composed of a list of tasks.

    The playbook can be run by executing it with
    the ansible-playbook command.

    The playbook can also be run by using the
    ansible command and specifying the -i option,
    which specifies inventory and -m option, which
    specifies module and module_arguments.

        ansible <host-pattern> -i inventory_file -m <module> \
        -a '<module_arguments>'
