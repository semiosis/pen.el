    Facts are things that are inferred from
    the remote system's current state or
    nature.

    They are not declared things, but rather
    are inferred from the system's current
    state.

    For example, if you want to check if a
    file exists on a remote system, you would
    use the file module with the path to the
    file you want to check.  The module will
    return a "stat" structure that contains
    information about the file.  This is a fact.

    If you want to check if a user exists on a
    remote system, you would use the user module.

    If you want to check if a database exists on
    a remote system, you would use the postgresql_db module.

    Facts are inferred from remote systems' states, not declared.
