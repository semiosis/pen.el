 Let's talk about that. If you're a
creative, you already know how precious that
inner voice of inspiration, creativity, and
beauty is. This is a key advantage those
creative right-brain types have over the more
pragmatic left-brain types. They've tasted the fruit
brought by the muse and already know they can
never go back to anything less. For you
creatives, this video will give you, I hope, a
better understanding of what the muse is and
can be for you and how it works.
