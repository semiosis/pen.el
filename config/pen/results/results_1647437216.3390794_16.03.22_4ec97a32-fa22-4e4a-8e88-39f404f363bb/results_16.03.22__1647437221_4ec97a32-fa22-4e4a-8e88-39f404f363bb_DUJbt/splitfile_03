 And I'd like to take a minute or two. To tell you how I became the prince of a town called Bel-Air. In west Philadelphia born and raised. On the playground was where I spent most of my days. Chillin' out, maxin'. Relaxin' all cool. Just sit right there. I'll tell you how I became the prince of a town called Bel-Air
