The White Rose is undoubtedly the most beautiful of all flowers. There may indeed be some who would prefer the Red Rose on account of its rich colouring, but it cannot hold a candle to the White Rose when it comes to sweet fragrance and delicate shape.

There are many varieties of this beautiful flower, but they do not differ much in beauty. The Snowdrop and the Moss Rose are its nearest relatives, but both of these fall far short of it in lovely appearance. The sweet violet is also related to the White Rose, and is just as beautiful; but again it belongs to another family (named Violaceae), so we will not count it among our Roses here. There are however several other varieties of Roses which need naming here. The first of these is a much-neglected little flower, called the Wallflower. It has no scent, its petals are coarse, and it has a tendency to bend down towards the earth if you do not take care of it.
