 automatic drawings, non-linear story-telling,
dreamlike renderings, and a simulation of the unconscious. The subject of
surrealism is often diverse, including animals and plants, fingerprints, human
anatomy and the human body, unreferenced textures, human psychologically
representative actions or parts of the body, as well as incidental
concrete objects. Thematic elements can include psychological processes and
abstract concepts such as entropy, free will, inner life or unconscious
processes. Dreams in surrealism often produce no real events or other
properties of real objects and phenomena. In several cases the imagery of the
dream or trance might simply be used to create a mental projection that is only
inferred to the viewer or observer. For instance, one might see a humanoid
robot in a surreal environment but deny that it is present on an actual robot.
Surreal forms may also be non-fiction and combine elements of surveys of ideas
