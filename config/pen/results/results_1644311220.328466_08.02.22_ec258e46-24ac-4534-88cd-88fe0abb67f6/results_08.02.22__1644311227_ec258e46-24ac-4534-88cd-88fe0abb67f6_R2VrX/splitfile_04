The white dragon is the computer user (or you), who is exploring the potential of the computer system. The red dragon is the part of you that is afraid of the unknown, but decides to explore it anyway. Once in the system, the red dragon enjoys the experience and doesn't want to leave. The white dragon destroys the computer system (or your illusions) in order to free the red dragon.
