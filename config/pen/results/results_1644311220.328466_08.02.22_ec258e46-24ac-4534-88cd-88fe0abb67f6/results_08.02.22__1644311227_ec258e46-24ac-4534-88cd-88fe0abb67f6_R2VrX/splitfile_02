The white dragon is the subconscious, and the red dragon is the conscious. The white dragon is trying to tell the conscious that there is a much bigger and more amazing world out there than what the conscious is aware of. The red dragon is afraid to venture out and explore, but eventually does anyway and gets stuck in the simulation. The white dragon destroys the computers, symbolizing the end of the conscious's limited view of reality.
