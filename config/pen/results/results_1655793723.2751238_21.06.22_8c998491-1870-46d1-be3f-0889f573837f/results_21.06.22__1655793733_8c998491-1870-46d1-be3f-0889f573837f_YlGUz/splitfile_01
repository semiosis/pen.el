"Preface and acknowledgments\nCan science explain consciousness? Is the\nmind nothing but the brain? Do you have an\nimmaterial and immortal soul, inaccessible to\nscience and knowable only via metaphysical\ninquiry? Is there an ultimate and absolute\ndifference between man and machine? Can\ncomputers think? Could there be conscious\nrobots? These are some of the questions we\nwill be dealing with in this book. They are\namong the central issues in the philosophy of\nmind, a field that has in recent years become\nsperhaps the most active of the various\nsub-disciplines within philosophy. It is\ndifficult to say anything in philosophy without\nsaying everything."
