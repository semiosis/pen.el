"Preface and acknowledgments\nCan science explain consciousness? Is the mind\nnothing but the brain? Do you have an immaterial\nand immortal soul, inaccessible to science and\nknown only via metaphysical inquiry? Is there an\nultimate and absolute difference between man and\nmachine? Can computers think? Could there be\nconscious robots? These are some of the questions\nwe will be dealing with in this book. They are\namong the central issues in the philosophy of mind,\na field that has in recent years become perhaps the\nmost active of the various sub-disciplines within\nphilosophy. It is difficult to say anything in\nphilosophy without saying everything."
