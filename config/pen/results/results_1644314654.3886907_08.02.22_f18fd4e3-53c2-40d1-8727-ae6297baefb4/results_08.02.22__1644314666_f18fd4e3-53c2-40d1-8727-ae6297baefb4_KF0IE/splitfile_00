The white dragon represents me.\nThe red dragon represents the person that is my enemy.\nThe white dragon is the good one.\nThe red dragon is the evil one.\nThe computer represents the world.\nThe computer can simulate realities.\nThere is no password, so I can go in.\nThe red dragon says "there's no way I'm going in there", because he is afraid of what's inside.\nHe decides to go in.\nI think he got stuck because he was having so much fun.\nThe white dragon destroyed the computers because he realized he couldn't get the red dragon out.\nThis is a metaphor for how I feel.
