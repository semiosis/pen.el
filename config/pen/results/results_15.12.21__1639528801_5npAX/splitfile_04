""water-chimney" refers to the phenomenon that water vaporizes at the bottom of chimneys, resulting in the formation of a layer of water vapor that rises up the chimney. This phenomenon is the opposite of the one that is commonly known as "steam" in which water vapor condenses into liquid at the top of a chimney. "
