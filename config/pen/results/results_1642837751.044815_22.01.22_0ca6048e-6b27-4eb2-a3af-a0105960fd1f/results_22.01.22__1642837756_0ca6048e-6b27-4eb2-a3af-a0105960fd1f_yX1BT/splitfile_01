Theatre is the art of lying. You are lying when you perform 'canned' dialogue. You are also lying when you present a character in a film who's personality doesn't match the actual person, such as Arnold Schwarzenegger playing terminator or Hugh Laurie playing House. Fakeumentary shows are designed to make us think we are seeing real recordings of real events even when we know that we are all being lied to."
