A "Fakeumentary" is an audio-visual story in the form of a film. It is a piece of theatre, with narration and performances, from the perspective of an unseen narrator. A "Fakeumentary" is often presented like a documentary, but throughout the context and commentary, there can clearly be enhancements to the narrative that would not be in a documentary. In this video, we can explore the idea of Fakeumentaries being theatre. I hope that you enjoy."
