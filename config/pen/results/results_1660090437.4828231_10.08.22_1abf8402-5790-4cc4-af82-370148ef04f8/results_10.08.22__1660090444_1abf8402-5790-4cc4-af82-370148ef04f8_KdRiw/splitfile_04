 The words “will you marry me” are spoken to the girl. If she answers “yes”, then proceed to ask if the proposal is the right one. After a long and awkward silence, answer “yes” to “is this you?” and wait for a long “yes” silence to reach a level of awkwardness as extended as the girl’s answer. Ask “what’s your name?”
