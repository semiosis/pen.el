"shift" is a bash builtin that shifts positional parameters.

It is useful for removing options from the command line.

"shift" is often used in scripts to remove options from the command line and pass the remaining arguments to another command.

#!/bin/bash

# shift all the parameters to the left
while [ "$1" != "" ]; do
    echo -n "$1 "
    shift
done
echo

# output:
# file1 file
