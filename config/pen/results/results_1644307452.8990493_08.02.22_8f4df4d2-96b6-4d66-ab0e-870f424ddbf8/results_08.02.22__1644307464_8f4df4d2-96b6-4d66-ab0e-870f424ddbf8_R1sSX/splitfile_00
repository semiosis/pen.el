In the dream, the white dragon represents the logical mind, the intellect.
The dream says that the logical mind can simulate "incredible realities, beyond space and time."
This is a metaphor for the ability to create new realities by using ones logic.
The red dragon represents the intuitive mind, the heart.
The dream then says that the intuitive mind is the source of our ability to create.
