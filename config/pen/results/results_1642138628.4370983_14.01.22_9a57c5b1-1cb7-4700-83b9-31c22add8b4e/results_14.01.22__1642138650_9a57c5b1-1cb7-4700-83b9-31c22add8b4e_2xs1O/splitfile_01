                u"Today, I was at Starbucks and ordered a coffee. The barista, accidentally, "
                u"gave me a venti caramel frappe with way too many pumps of syrup. I mean, I "
                u"don't mind a syrup waterfall, but it was just nasty. I couldn't even taste "
                u"the caramel. When the frappe was first introduced to America, there was only "
                u"one size: 12 ounces. If you want more coffee, then you want to order a venti "
                u"frappe. If you wanted to drink a little bit less coffee, you would order a "
                u"grande frappe. If you wanted to drink a little bit more coffee, then you "
                u"would order a venti frappe. But there was only one size. Now, there are three "
                u"different sizes: 8, 12 and 16 ounces. The sizes are in relation to how many "
                u"coffee shots should be added to the drink. If you are a person that enjoys "
                u"coffee, you probably drink between two and three coffee shots in a standard "
                u"grande frappe. If you need more coffee, order a venti frappe. If you want "
                u"less coffee, order a grande frappe. If you want even less coffee, then order "
                u"a tall frappe.",
