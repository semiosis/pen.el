"This book aims, accordingly, to provide a solid introduction both to the traditional arguments against materialism and to the contemporary arguments in favor of it. This is all the more important given that eventoday, critics of materialism constitute a large and influential minority position within the field. It is time an introduction to the subject reflected this fact, and avoided the excessive materialist bias that has become all too common in introductory volumes."
