"JSONParserCommon" is a module that provides a common interface to the JSON
parser.

The interface is as follows:

run_parser_print :: ParseState -> IO ( Either ErrInfo ( JValue ) )
run_parser_print ps = run_parser ( print_parse_result ps )

The ParseState is a record that contains the current position in the input
stream, the current line number, the current column number, and the current
character.
