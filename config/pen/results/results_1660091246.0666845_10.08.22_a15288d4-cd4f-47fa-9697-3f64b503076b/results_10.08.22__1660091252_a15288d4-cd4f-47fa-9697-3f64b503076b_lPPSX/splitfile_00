 As a girl is a human being, the typical method of proposing is to simply ask the woman to marry them. To successfully do this, one must have met the woman at a public place. If one has not met the woman in public, a sorry message must be sent to the woman, stating that it is a shame that they cannot fulfill their intentions.
