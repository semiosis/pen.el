I just joined the OSM Â community a little while ago. Although I've been using it for several years. I've never edited it, although I'm probably going to start. Over the last year, I've probably been in three or four #osm meetings. I think it's great to have a way to bring people together who are interested in open source mapping and in particular OpenStreetMap.
