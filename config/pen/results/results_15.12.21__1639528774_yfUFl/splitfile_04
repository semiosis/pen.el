 they lived by a well;â€”that is to say, their grandmother,
who lived in a cottage at the bottom of the hill, kept a cow and gave milk
to all the children in the neighbourhood, and each child carried home her
share daily.  The cow gave them milk enough, but lacily enough; and they
were always very happy and quite contented with it; for it was as sweet as
rose-water; and they had their faces always so rosy-red, and their
hands so soft and white, that no one could pass that way but they would
stop and look at them a minute or two; for there is nothing prettier or
more harmless than these little sisters.  'Ah,' said the cow to herself,
'if my daughters were but two fairer than they are, I'd give them to my
neighbours for a dowry when they're married.'  And she said nothing more.
