 Preface and acknowledgments Can science explain consciousness? Is the mind nothing but the brain? Do you have an immaterial and immortal soul, inaccessible to science and knowable only via metaphysical inquiry? Is there an ultimate and absolute difference between man and machine? Can computers think? Could there be conscious robots? These are some of the questions we will be dealing with in this book. They are among the central issues in the philosophy of mind, a field that has in recent years become perhaps the most active of the various sub-disciplines within philosophy. It is difficult to say anything in philosophy without saying everything.
