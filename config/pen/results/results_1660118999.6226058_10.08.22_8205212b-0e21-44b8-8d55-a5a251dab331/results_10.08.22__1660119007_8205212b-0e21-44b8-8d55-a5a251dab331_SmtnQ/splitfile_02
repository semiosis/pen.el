	Stars are far away things, tatoos on our soul
	Geometry is the key to the unknown, unknown

	Geometry is the key to the unknown, unknown

	Geometry is the key, it's a secret to everybody, everybody
	Unknown, unknown

	Unknown, unknown

	Stars are far away things, tatoos on our soul
	Geometry is the key to the unknown, unknown
	Geometry is the key to the unknown, unknown

	Geometry is the key, it's a secret to everybody, everybody
	Unknown, uknown
