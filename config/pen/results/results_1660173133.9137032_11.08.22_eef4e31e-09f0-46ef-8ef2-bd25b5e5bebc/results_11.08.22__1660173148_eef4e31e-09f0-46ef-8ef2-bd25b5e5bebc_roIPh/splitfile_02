 For the more analytical left hemisphere types there's an absolute gold mine waiting here for you as well. It may seem a little bit out of there at first but if you take to heart these words from Aristotle, Plato, Carl Jung, Socrates, and Schopenhauer, I believe it will change your life; and drastically for the better as it has for me. One disclaimer I'd like to throw out there is that you can hear some truth, some falsehood, and some in between the two, but if you learn to hear the voice of truth, it will lead you to the sweetest fruit life has to offer.
