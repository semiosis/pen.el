# The source is specified with the 'source' variable, and the content
# is specified with the 'content' variable.  The content can be a list
# of files, or a directory (in which case all files in the directory
# are synced).  If a directory is specified, only files that end in
# .yaml are synced.  The destination is specified with the 'dest'
# variable, which defaults to /apps/content/new_collection.
