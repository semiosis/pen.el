# This playbook is intended to be run on a Library server. It will
# synchronize the Library with a source of content.
#
# The source of content is configured by the "sync_source" variable.
# The list of collections to sync is configured by the "collections"
# variable. Both of these variables can be overridden by including them
# in the "run" variable.
