"ScopedTypeVariables" is a GHC extension that allows you to use type variables in types, even if the type variable isn't in scope.

The following code will not compile:

{-# LANGUAGE ScopedTypeVariables #-}
data T a = T1 (a, a)

main = print (T1 (1, 2))

The error message is:

• Couldn't match type ‘a’ with ‘Int’
