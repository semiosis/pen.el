"ScopedTypeVariables" is a GHC extension that allows you to declare a type variable in a forall statement.

This is useful when you want to declare a type variable that is only in scope for a specific part of a type signature.

For example, consider the following code:

data T a = MkT (a, a)

This is a data type with two fields, both of which are of the same type, a.

However, we want to use the type variable a
