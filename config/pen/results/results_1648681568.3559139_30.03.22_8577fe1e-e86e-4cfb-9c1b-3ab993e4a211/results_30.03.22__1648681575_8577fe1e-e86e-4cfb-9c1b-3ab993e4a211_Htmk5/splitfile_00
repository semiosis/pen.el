"Data.Text" is a library for working with text as a sequence of Unicode characters.

The following example shows how to parse a JSON string into a Data.Text value:

import Data.Text (Text)

parseJSON :: Text -> Maybe a
parseJSON (Text str) = parseJSON' str []
  where
    parseJSON' :: Text -> [Text] -> Maybe a
    parseJSON' (Text str) stack = case str of
      "" -> case reverse
