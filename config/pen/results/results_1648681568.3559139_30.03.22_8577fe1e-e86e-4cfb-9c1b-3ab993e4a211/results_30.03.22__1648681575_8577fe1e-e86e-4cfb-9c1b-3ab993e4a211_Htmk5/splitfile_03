"Data.Text" is a module for working with text as a sequence of Unicode
code points.

The module is intended to be a safe and friendly alternative to
representing strings as lists of integers.

The module is intended to be used with Haskell 98, and should work
with a large subset of the functions defined in the Haskell report.

The module provides a type, Text, with a variety of
constructors, and a variety of functions for converting to and
from Strings.
