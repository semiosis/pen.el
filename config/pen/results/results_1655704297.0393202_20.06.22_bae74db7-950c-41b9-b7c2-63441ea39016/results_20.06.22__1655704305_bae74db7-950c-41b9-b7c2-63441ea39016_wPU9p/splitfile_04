 the ego in this sense acts like a filter and it is this property which allows it to concentrate on a limited number of things at any given time. Another characteristic of consciousness is that it is self-referential by this I mean that the ego judges and discriminates based on what it already knows and what is familiar with and has a tendency to exclude things which are incompatible with its preconceptions. As Jung puts it, this judgment is partial and prejudiced since it chooses one particular possibility at the cost of all the others.
