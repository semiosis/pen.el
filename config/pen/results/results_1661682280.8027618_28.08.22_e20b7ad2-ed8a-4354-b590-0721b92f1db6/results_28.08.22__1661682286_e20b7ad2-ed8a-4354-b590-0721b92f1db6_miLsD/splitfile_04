"define-expression" is a custom command that allows you to define a new 
expression. The expression can be used in a .sawsrc file.

For example, the following command defines a new expression named "my-expression" 
that returns the value of the environment variable named "MY_ENV_VAR":

saws define-expression --name my-expression --value $MY_ENV_VAR

You can then use the "my-expression" expression
