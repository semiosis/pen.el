The dream is a metaphor for the programming.\nThe white dragon represents the computer, that is the logic that goes into the computer.\nThe red dragon represents the user, that is the person who uses the program.\nThe computer genious represents the code, that is the program.\nThe computer system represents the code, that is the program.\nThe computer system ran for a really long time because the user is programming the computer, and the computer is running the program.\nThe red dragon gets stuck inside the computer because the user is stuck in the program.\nThe white dragon destroys all the computers because the user wants to destroy the program.\nAnd the red dragon says there's no way I'm going in there because the user doesn't want to go into the program.\nThey both agree that the program is really good and they both like it.
