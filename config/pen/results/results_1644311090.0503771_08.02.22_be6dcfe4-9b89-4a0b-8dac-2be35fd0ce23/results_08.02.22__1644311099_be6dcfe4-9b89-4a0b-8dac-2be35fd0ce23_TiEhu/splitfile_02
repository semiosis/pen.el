The red dragon is me, the human, and the white dragon is the computer.\nThe computer is the reality that gives me comfort, but it has no password.\nThe white dragon is the mind that's destroying itself.\nThe red dragon is the body that's destroying itself.\nI am stuck in the computer's reality.\nThe computer is destroying all of the realities that I try to escape from.
