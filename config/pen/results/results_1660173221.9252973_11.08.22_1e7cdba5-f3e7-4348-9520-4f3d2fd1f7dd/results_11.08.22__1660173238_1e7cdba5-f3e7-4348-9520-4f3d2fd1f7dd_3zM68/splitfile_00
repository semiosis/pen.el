 Lastly,
there are literal truths and there are
metaphorical truths. Most of the ideas
presented in this video are metaphorical that
is valuable truths that will provide you with
great reward rewards if you treat them as
perfectly literal truth but are in reality not
perfectly literal truth that said somewhere
hidden in the metaphysical world of the muse
there is i believe literal truth. I won't
pretend i'm able to show you the proof of that
but i believe it's there and there seems to be
a way to filter out the lesser voices of
partial truths and outright lies that we hear
from time to time from the highest forms of
truth and i believe that act brings us closer
to wholeness on the path to individuation
self-actualization self-overcoming and
ultimately oneness with god whether
metaphorically or literally.
