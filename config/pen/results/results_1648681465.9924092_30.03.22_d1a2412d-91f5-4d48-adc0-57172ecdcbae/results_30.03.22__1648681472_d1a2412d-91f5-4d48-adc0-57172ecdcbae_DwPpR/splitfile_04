"GeneralizedNewtypeDeriving" is a newtype deriving extension for Haskell.

It provides a way to create newtypes that can be used in deriving instances.

The main use case is to create newtypes that are instances of Eq, Ord,
Enum, Bounded, Show, Read, and Num.

The newtype must be defined in a separate module.

The newtype must have a single field.

The newtype must not be a member of a larger data
