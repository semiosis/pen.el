"Lyra is rushing to the cold, far North, where witch clans and armored bears rule. North, where the Gobblers take the children they steal--including her friend Roger. North, where her fearsome uncle Asriel is trying to build a bridge to the other side of the wall that separates the parallel worlds of Earth and the universe of the daemon Lyra has been following. North and into a deadly cold and a even more dangerous cold than the one she fears. A cold that will change her forever."
