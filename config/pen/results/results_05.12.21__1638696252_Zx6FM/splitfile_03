"Lyra is rushing to the cold, far North, where witch clans and armored bears rule. North, where the Gobblers take the children they steal--including her friend Roger. North, where her fearsome uncle Asriel is trying to build a bridge to the other side of the wall that separates the two worlds. Can one small girl make a difference in such great and terrible endeavors? This is a fantasy book for older children--and a deeply moving story of love, loyalty, and courage that will appeal to grown-ups, too."
