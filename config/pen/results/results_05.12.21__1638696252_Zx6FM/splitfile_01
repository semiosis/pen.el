"Lyra is rushing to the cold, far North, where witch clans and armored bears rule. North, where the Gobblers take the children they steal--including her friend Roger. North, where her fearsome uncle Asriel is trying to build a bridge to the other side of the wall that separates the parallel worlds of Lyra's world from the world of the daemon Lyra is following. To break Asriel's bridge, and save Roger, and save her world, Lyra has a desperate plan, which she and her daemon help her carry out."
