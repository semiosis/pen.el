"It is possible, of course, that the majority view in the history of the subject was erroneous, and that the currently orthodox approach is the right one; but it is also possible that the historically dominant view was correct, and that contemporary philosophers have made a mistake in departing from it. Philosophy, in any case, is not about believing what is fashionable, but about discovering what is true. It is crucial, then, if one is properly to understand the philosophy of mind, that one be as familiar with the chief arguments of the anti-materialists side as one is with the arguments for materialism."
