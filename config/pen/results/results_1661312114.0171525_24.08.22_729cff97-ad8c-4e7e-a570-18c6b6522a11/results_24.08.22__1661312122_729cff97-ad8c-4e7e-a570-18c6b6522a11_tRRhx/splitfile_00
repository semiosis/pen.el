    - define a set of hosts in a given role,
    - group some hosts based on Facts,
    - apply some variable values from Facts to templates,
    - use the fact values in playbooks to decide what those
      specific hosts should do.
- you: Ok. And what about variables? What do they do?
- ansible guru: Variables are intended to be set in
               playbooks or vars files, and are then used to
               influence how the playbooks (or other tasks)
               run. This means that the Values they are set to
               can be dynamic, based on the value of another variable,
               a result of task execution, or any other imaginable form.

    And because Ansible variables can be anything from a simple string to a complex hash or list of values, Ansible uses Jinja2â„¢ templating
