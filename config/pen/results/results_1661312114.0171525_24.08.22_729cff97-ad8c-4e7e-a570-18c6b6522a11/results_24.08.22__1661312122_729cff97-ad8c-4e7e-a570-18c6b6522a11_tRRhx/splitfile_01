 system.
- you: In what way are facts and variables different?
- ansible guru: Vars are declared things.
                Facts are things that are inferred from
                the remote system's current state.
- you: What is the default for a variable?
- ansible guru: It's a string (which is different from a fact)
- you: Explain the {{}} syntax. What does it do?
- ansible guru: The {{}} syntax is used to output a variable.
                If you say {{somevar}} in a template, then Ansible will output whatever value somevar has in that moment in time.

    The real power of ansible comes when we get to loops and conditionals and Jinja2 templating language. We're going to talk in detail about this syntax tomorrow.
