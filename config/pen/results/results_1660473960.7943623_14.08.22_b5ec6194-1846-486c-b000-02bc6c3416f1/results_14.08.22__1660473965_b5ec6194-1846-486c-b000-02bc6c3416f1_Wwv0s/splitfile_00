NASA’s James Webb Space Telescope has captured the first images of a “white hole” — a black hole that ejects matter instead of sucking it in.

This is the first time a black hole has been imaged by the Webb telescope and the first time such an image has been seen with an optical telescope.

The image is a patch of space showing the remains of a dead star that fell into a black hole. The region is about 3,000 light-years across.

The images were taken with the Webb telescope’s Wide Field Camera. The images are shown in the video above.

The first image was captured on April
