I was hanging out with friends and we saw vivid red star formations appear in the sky , which sent an electrical shock down my spine. This indicated that something was wrong in the astral world. Soon after, circular UFOs started falling from the sky, which indicated both an emergency in the astral world and a situation in which an event that is larger than my friends and I had occurred.
