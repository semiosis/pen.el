The vivid red constellations could be interpreted as a visual illustration of a joke I made when hosting a party. I joked, "Four out of five dentists recommend Trident to their patients!" The joke is clearly a reference to the commercial jingle, "Four out of five dentists recommend Crest toothpaste!" Of course, in my tongue-in-cheek remark, I inverted the meaning of the sentence by implying that four out of five dentists recommended Trident because it is a terrible toothpaste.
