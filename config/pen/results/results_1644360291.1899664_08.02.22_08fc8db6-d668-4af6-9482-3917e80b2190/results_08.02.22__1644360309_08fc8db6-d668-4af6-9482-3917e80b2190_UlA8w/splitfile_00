Warm greetings, Mark.
Mark: You were in shows such as Baywatch and One Tree Hill. What's your favorite project that
you've worked on?
Jason Momoa: I think the film I'm most proud of is "Game of Thrones". I'm really close with
the women on that show. I have a tight knit family and we spend a lot of time together. I work
with my family all the time and my kids as well.
Mark: I've heard that you're a total badass at karaoke. What's your go-to song?
Jason Momoa: I love all kinds of music, but especially rock. I get into everything from Iron
Maiden to Metallica to Guns N' Roses to Boyz II Men. I'm a huge fan.
Mark: What do you think about the upcoming movie Aquaman?
Jason Momoa: Let me first say that I never expected the level of success that Aquaman has
been experiencing in the past year. It's been overwhelming. I think that the movie is
something that fans are going to love. I think it's a really cool and fun movie. It has
everything. Action. Adventure. Beautiful women. Cool storylines. Fun, Aquaman-like
characterizations. I think that it's a great start to what I hope is many, many more
movies. I don't know how many movies it's going to become,
