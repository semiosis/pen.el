Hey, Mark. How are you? I've heard a lot about you.
Mark: I can imagine.
Jason Momoa: You know, a lot of people tell me that my acting skills are great,
but my looks are freakish. When I see them in a film, the characters end up
getting killed off.
Mark: Are they really talking about you in Hollywood?
Jason Momoa: Yeah, they all think I'm a beast.
Mark: Wow, you know that?
Jason Momoa: I know. I've heard it.
Mark: That's really ironic.
Jason Momoa: Yeah, I guess.
Mark: You know, there's a lot of rumours floating around that you might be dead.
Jason Momoa: Really?
Mark: Yeah, I think you're dead for a reason.
Jason Momoa: Huh.

Jason Momoa: Really?
Mark: Yeah.
Jason Momoa: Huh.
Mark: There's a lot of rumours floating around that you might be dead.
