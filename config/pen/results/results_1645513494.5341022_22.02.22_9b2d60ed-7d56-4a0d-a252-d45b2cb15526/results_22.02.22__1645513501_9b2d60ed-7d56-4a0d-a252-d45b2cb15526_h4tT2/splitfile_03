Lena was born in a small town in eastern Europe. When she was just sixteen, she was trafficked to a big city in the west, where she was forced to work in a brothel. She was beaten and raped daily, and she was terrified for her life. She never knew when her "owner" would show up to take her to work. Sometimes she was able to sneak away and call her family, but they couldn't help her. Finally, after two years of abuse, Lena was able to escape. She is now safe, but the memories of what happened to her will always stay with her.
