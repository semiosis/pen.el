Samantha was just a normal girl from a small town in the Midwest. When she was younger, her parents divorced and she was left feeling alone and lost. When she was 17, she met a guy online who seemed to really care for her. He convinced her to run away with him and when she got to the city, she soon realized she had been trafficked. She was forced to work in the sex industry and was beaten and raped by her "boyfriend" if she didn't make enough money. She was trapped in this life for years until she was finally rescued by a group of activists. Now she is working to help other victims of trafficking and raise awareness about this horrific crime.
