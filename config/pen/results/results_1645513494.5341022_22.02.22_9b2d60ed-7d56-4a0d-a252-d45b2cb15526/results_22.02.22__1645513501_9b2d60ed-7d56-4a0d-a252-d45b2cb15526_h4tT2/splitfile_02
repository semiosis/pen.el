She was just a young girl when she was trafficked. She didn't know anything about the world and the dangers that awaited her. She was taken from her home and forced into a life of prostitution. She was beaten and abused, and she didn't know if she would ever escape. But she did. She found the courage to run away and start over. She's rebuilding her life now, and she's determined to never let anyone hurt her again. She's a survivor.
