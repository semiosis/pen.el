"my dear spiritual children now that I am still in charge of my faculties I want to give you some advice. Ever since I was a child I was always in sin when my mother sent me to watch the animals on the mountain. My father had gone to America to work on the panama canal for us. His children because we were poor. There where I shepherded the animals. I slowly read word by word the life of saint john the hutt dweller and I loved saint john very much. I said a lot of prayers like the young child that I was 12 or 15 years old. I don't remember too well."
