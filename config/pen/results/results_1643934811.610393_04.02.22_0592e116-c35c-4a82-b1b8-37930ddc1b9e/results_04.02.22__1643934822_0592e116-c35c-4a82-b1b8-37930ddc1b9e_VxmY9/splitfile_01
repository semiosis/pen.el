He is the one who always has the right plan. He is the one who always has the right solution. He is the one who always has the right way. He is the one who always has the right way forward. He is the one who always has the right way to go. He is the one who always has the right way to live. He is the one who always has the right way to think. He is the one who always has the right way to work. He is the one who always has the right way.
