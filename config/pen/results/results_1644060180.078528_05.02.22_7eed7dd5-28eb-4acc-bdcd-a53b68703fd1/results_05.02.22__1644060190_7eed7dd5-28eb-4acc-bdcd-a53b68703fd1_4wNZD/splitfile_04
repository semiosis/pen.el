 you know, kid, I'm at a point in my life where I just want to be  taken care of,  I hate taking care of myself,  I hate cooking,  I hate shopping,  I'm an  evil wizard and I have no time to do  anything I want like play quidditch or anything, you know, it's really  hard having to do chores, I'm an  evil wizard,  this is so embarrassing,  I'm like a house wife,  get the  kettle ready and make tea,  I like to mix it with honey and milk,  this is really  embarrassing, I'm like that guy from Twilight,  you know the one, with the long hair and the  long night gown,
