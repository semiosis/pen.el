  Systemd.service(5) - System and service manager
  Systemd.service(5)

  1. Description

  Systemd is a system and service manager for Linux, compatible with
  SysV and LSB init scripts. systemd provides aggressive parallelism
  and uses a micro-service approach, with systemd units as the basic
  building blocks of an application.

  Systemd is a replacement for sysvinit. It can be used to control the
  systemd daemon itself (start/stop/restart), to manage user
  sessions, and to run in parallel multiple instances of commands.
  Systemd is compatible with the standard SysV init daemon.
