  Systemd.service(5) - System and service manager
  Systemd.service(5)

  1. Description

  Systemd is a system and service manager for Linux, compatible with
  SysV and LSB init scripts. systemd provides aggressive parallelism
  and uses a micro-service approach, with systemd units as the basic
  building blocks of an application.

  Systemd is a replacement for sysvinit. It can be used to control the
  systemd daemon itself (see systemd.service(5) for details) as well
  as other system daemons and services.

  The systemd daemon prepares the system for the root user and starts
  the login
