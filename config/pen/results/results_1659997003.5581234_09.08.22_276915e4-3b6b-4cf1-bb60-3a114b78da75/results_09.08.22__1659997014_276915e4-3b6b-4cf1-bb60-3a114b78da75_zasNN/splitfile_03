I've always been a fan of Melee and it's the only game I've ever played competitively.  I've been playing for about 10 years now, starting with the first Smash Bros. release on Gamecube.  I've played in several tournaments, including the [Smash Summit](https://liquipedia.net/smash/Smash_Summit/Melee).  I've also played in several local tournaments in the Pacific Northwest and have won a few local tournaments as well.

I'm hoping to get better at Melee and eventually compete at a higher level, but for now, I'm just enjoying the game and playing locally.  I'm hoping to play with you at some point in the future and see how we compare!
