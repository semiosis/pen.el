I've been thinking about this for a while and I'd like to get it out in the open.
I've been in love with you for a long time and I'd like to spend the rest of my life with you.
I know we haven't been together for very long but I know that this is what I want.
I know that we have a lot of things to work out but I want to do it with you.
I know that we will have our ups and downs but I want to do it with you.
I know that we will have our arguments but I want to do it with you.
I know that we will have our disagreements but I want to do it with you.
I know that we will have our disagreements but I want to do it with you.
I know that we will have our disagreements but I want to do it with you.
I know that we will have our disagreements but I want to do it
