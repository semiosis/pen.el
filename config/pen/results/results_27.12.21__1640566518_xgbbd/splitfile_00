"post-truth" is a term coined by the British political scientist Matthew Goodwin in an analysis of the British vote to leave the European Union in 2016.
The term refers to the idea that voters are increasingly using political discourse for the purpose of advancing their own political interests rather than the search for truth.
In other words, voters are expressing their identity through language rather than reasoning.
