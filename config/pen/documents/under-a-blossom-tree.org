As I was walking home today, I walked past the
place where I last saw 🍓, and I saw
it was under a blossom tree.

I didn't know at the time because the tree had
not yet blossomed, but today it had.

I took one back home with me.

And now I have to write something.
I will try in the style of William Wordsworth.

I'll use Pen to do it.

I Wandered Lonely as a Cloud
BY WILLIAM WORDSWORTH
I wandered lonely as a cloud
That floats on high o'er vales and hills,
When all at once I saw a crowd,
A host, of golden daffodils;
Beside the lake, beneath the trees,
Fluttering and dancing in the breeze.

Under a blossom tree
By WILLIAM WORDSWORTH

I wandered dreamfully up a hillside path,
Under the blossom trees.

And as I was tired and wistful,
Joy and wonder,
At a door where I had once heard light
Come singing through the trees.

** I'll pick out some of these

** Plan
*** Start by ranking them in order?
- Understanding
  - When first met
- Love
  - When I had to go, a day after I last talked to her
- My rest
  - Truth
  - Peace
  - When I wrote LWoT

*** Or just write something first, then prompt to make it sound pretty?
*** Just write ideas

** I think I got this with 🍓
All these first.

- Pleroma
- Faith
- Hope
- Understanding
  - Yeah
- Love
- Happiness
- Wisdom
- Idea
- Life
  - Well yeah.
- Church

Under a blossom tree I found my (in order)
- Wisdom
- Courage
  - Mulan
- Knowledge
  - Study (computer science)
- My happiness
- My rest
- Part of my truth
- Sige
  - This is true, too
- Ennoea
  - Idea
  - I like this
- Charis
  - Part of my grace
- Part of my pleroma
- My summer
- My hope
  - All the times I've been in the dark
- My aeon
- My syzygy
- My world
- My heaven on Earth, modelled after the eternal realm

I learned to write
I found a strawbery
And I brought it home to you.

The pentamerous petals of a blossom
Shone through my room at night
And filled me with a love
For the small things in life.

A blossom on the lawn
How beautiful it was
I took it home to you
But left a heart for déjà vu.

Under a blossom tree
I learned to love you
And under a blossom tree
I imagined you were mine.

I put the strawbery back
Under the blossom tree
The wind said "put it back"

Under a blossom tree
I learn

** Summer and winter
- More acknowledgement of [[https://mullikine.github.io/posts/gospel-of-philip/][Philip]]
  - Summer is the eternal Aeon
  - Summer follows winter
  - When the Holy Spirit blows, summer arrives
- [[https://mullikine.github.io/posts/pink-cherry-blossoms-splash/][Pink Cherry Blossoms Splash // Bodacious Blog]]

However, I will also say, that this world
generally is still winter, and the eternal
realm (summer) is yet to arrive.

Yet because this world is modelled after the
pattern above, this little piece of heaven
exists in form and substance here and now.

** Learning about the aeons
