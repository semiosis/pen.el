# description: "Liberty Prime was found and brought to working order by the Brotherhood of Steel. Its total restoration was due to the assistance of Dr. Madison Li, who solved Prime's power issues in the year 2277. After its destruction at the satellite relay station in the same year it remained in disrepair until 2287, when it was brought to Boston for restoration and activation."
