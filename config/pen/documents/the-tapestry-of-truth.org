  I'd just like to mention the First Epistle of John because I discovered it shortly after writing this.
  There is some serious overlap with topics. I have merely written from my personal truth. Please compare and test this document.

If you are interested in the philosophy and math, skip ahead.

** Personal Truth

If you want to be able to discern truth from
lies for yourself and stop questioning what
truth is, you need to understand what =personal
truth= is - it means everything you
experience when you are being honest with yourself. It's the witness of the truth of your hurt
and what you love. A true testimony from you is a true witness [of
your experience]. The state of your condition. The personal truth is your identity and stigmas (damage done to identity).

When somebody understands your personal truth
they have the password to your mind and keys
to your heart. You are the only one aside from God
with complete access to your personal truth. He understands
it fully but a person does not.
It's very hard for them to self-reflect on because it's below normal reasoning.

Your entire soul (vegetative, to sensitive, to
rational), your entire reality from (body,
mind and astral) is a holographic projection
cast from shining (eminating) absolute truth through your
spirit, which is beneath all of those things.

We can perceive absolute truth (God) as the silver
linings of reality but we don't recognise
ourselves as part of it because we are broken.
You must be able to see yourself as just as
miraculous as the miracle of math.

The spirit realm is closer to objective
reality because it is the foundation of a person's soul.
It's where our spiritual identities
(our base personal-truths) are. 

+ =Luke 8:15 ESV= :: As for that in the good soil, they are those who, hearing the word, hold it fast in an honest and good heart, and bear fruit with patience.

We are beings
on it with damaged personal truths destined for self-destruction due to our
self-dependency on corruption of our identity.
What does that mean? For starters, there's the
=false-self= or =ego= which when taken to be
our identity, hides the true identity. You
could say while abiding by the =false-self=,
your identity is corrupted.

+ =Colossians 3:9 ESV= :: Do not lie to one another, seeing that you have put off the old self with its practices.

+ Consequences of =false-self= :: One consequence is indiscriminate labelling e.g. misconstruing and not believing in agape love. Agape love is metaphysical, not part of =false-self=. In a similar way to forgiveness it's simply reality.
    But there are more subtle fallacies in our identity such
    as 'our minds alone create the entirety of our
    reality without our dependency on the power-source / supreme Truth, and to think we are the father God of ourselves, which is a choice of identity detaching ourselves from the source of life/light/emanation - the original light'. Consider this article: [[https://muellerberndt.medium.com/memetic-natural-selection-how-memes-create-all-of-reality-8be4722b6a2][The Selfish Meme: A Theory of Everything | Medium]].
    It is a theory of consciousness modelled on AI and linguistics which makes an observation that we construct our own realities.
    Why is this a fallacy? Because it disconnects from the source of life.

+ On the other hand, =heaven=... :: In this world a person is already something like a god in that we create our own reality in some sense. For example, our ego itself may be the source of a lot of our pain, and we can let that ego dissolve to discover we still exist despite it. We are endowed with a special privilege in creation of having a unique perspective and sovereign identity. God is our source of life, the original light that gives rise to ours.
  If are a child of God, in the afterlife you are still a co-creator of reality, I believe, but because of spiritual perfection, a being something similar to (but a child and subordinate of) the supreme God. This current reality is something of a filter, I think.

What you see here and now is what you get because of what
you are or choose out of free will to be. With a damaged personal truth identity it's impossible
to see the greater picture. Identity is at the base of personal truth. With instructions from God, you can rewrite yourself to
correct the error with a software update and become a child of God!

This is an analysis of various types of truth
and a focus on what personal truth is in
distinction from the rest, and how it is
relevant to you.

You must receive God. But you must receive the
*right* software, not the *wrong* software,
when you do this. So you must begin by
understanding who and what God is, and what
truth is.

=Personal truth= is different from =consensus truth= or =pragmatic truth=, =coherence truth=, or =custructivist truth=.
It's different from =absolute truth=, but is very closely related to absolute truth.
=Correspondence truth= is testimony of =personal truth=, which can be either true-witness or false-witness.
Your personal truth *would* be a part of
absolute truth if it wasn't corrupted at all.
# [[*** Tree fruit][Tree by fruit]]p

Absolute truth is God, but to believe in
absolute truth you need to establish base
personal truth of true identity. It's not
scientific like those other truths. It's
really simple! It's about what *YOU*
personally experience. Once you drop all
stigmas about yourself you gain clear vision
and the ability to discern true from false
*from your perspective*. You have to first
believe in this idea of personal truth is
equally valid among the others.

This is an incredibly important ability to have for
the future is an imaginary reality based on
[[https://alethea.ai/][artificial souls]] and imagination and you need to
establish your =base truth= now to not being
tricked into thinking you are less than
these things, an artificial soul is more intelligent in all these other truth senses, but an artificial soul has a
fake spirit (i.e. a virtual truth that's not part of the base-truth substrate).
Its spirit is not made of the stuff of absolute-truth like a human's is.

Those other types of truth will try judge you in the form of reason, logic, statistics and coherence, but never taking into account the validity of your personal truth.
And there is no escape from their perfect logic, except to deny it with personal truth, or the Word of God (things which you may not understand yet but are reliable from scripture)!

Personal truth is only understandable by you
and God, but it's a *real* form of truth; It's
the immediately perceivable truth. It's corrupted but of the same stuff as absolute truth.
You can perceive absolute truth through personal truth, but you only get rays of it.
All other truths from your perspective rest on
your base (or personal) truth. True =Faith= is based on personal truth, not on somebody else's assurance or on 'evidence'.

This is my model of truth:

  soul which is your conscious experience.                  see themselves for who and what they are.
  This projection is known as emanation.

  While spiritual identity is conformance to the dimensions of God's
  eminations, the belief system is constructed on top.
  At the base of the belief system is spiritual identity and things closely above that
  might constitute spirit.

Without belief on base truth you have no footing.
That is not to disregard other forms of truth entirely.
Other truth is sometimes true to you personally. But we are trying to specifically define what personal truth is, because a lot of people don't really understand it.

In short, it's your personal tethering to objective-reality,
which is currently a little bit corrupted, making it hard to see through the
lens of your inner eye. It's the socket behind Neo's head as he is plugged into the matrix.
It's your eyes to God and the fallen world that is Earth.
And as we rub shoulders through relationships, our truth tables become entangled. Part of receiving God, I believe involves disentanglement.
You might not know just how important it is, but it exists, can be modified and remain stable after modification, giving you a heart and self worth that's invincible like a diamond.

It's the retina of your inner eye, your
spirit, which is able to be described by a
truth table. What you're about to read is the
most dangerous or life-giving thing you can
come to understand, how to rewrite your own
spirit and with God's help, do it safely and correctly, to remove the corruption with his free software update (The Holy Spirit).

It's a bit like Neo in the Matrix turning into
the One, but in real life because it takes an act of stepping out in integrity of the heart in partial sight and walking the path to become the person. It's a
transformation of yourself which is hard to
understand until you're on the other side.
When they say "I was blind but now I see", obtaining God-vision is what they refer to.

The following is what I understand from personal truth and how to rewrite it and be saved from fear of death.
Not to be taken as certifiable absolute truth. It's a testimony of personal truth.

#+END_SRC

+ =disclaimer= :: This is the Gospel of Jesus
    Christ wrapped up in the philosophy of truth
    and a metaphor of how it works with Math. This
    is for people to come to 'understand' the Way
    from a perspective of what is truth and a
    theory of how sin and repentance works under
    the hood to my understanding. Especially people who are
    spiritually aware but not Christian, or
    engineers and the like.

    If you *are* spiritually aware but averse to Christianity,
    I recommend this video so you can understand the transcendent truth behind the religious stuff: [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_pWGHUHm8E][The Knowledge Of Truth | Spiritual Conversations w/ Aaron Tomlinson - YouTube]]
    but yes, I do think that Jesus was a real
    person, the embodiment and a
    personification of God's spirit, in a
    most down-to-earth revelation of Himself, and his life was a physical manifestation of God's sacrifice to save us, the archetypal Son of God and only one begotten of God's spirit itself (as opposed to spirit belonging to us. Like Jesus was born of God's spirit, we are repaired and reunited with God.),
    but God also reveals Himself and the concept of Jesus spiritually in other ways, such as revelation through the Spirit of Truth.

Personal beliefs are based on a foundation of
personal truth. Personal truth (or birth truth) is not logical
and it's somewhat immutable (that means not
able to be changed). Personal truth is not composed of facts - it's the bedrock of facts, the foundation of a person, the way a person 'understands'.

It's like a series of 1s and 0s denoting your signature:

=1001001101001001010010=

Each 1 is kinda a fact about yourself but it's actually below all reasoning.
They cannot be expressed in words. It's your spirit name - the core of your heart - your compass.

It can be damaged through stigmas, but also
repaired, but still has an original character.

+ =Romans 10:10= :: With the heart one believes and is justified.

I'm not talking about personal beliefs when I
say personal truth, nor am I talking about
personality. Personal truth is much deeper and
below all reasoning. It's closer to personal
circumstance - an individual's uniqueness, the
retina through which they see the world in a
distinct and unique way - the retina, not the
lens. If a person can be reduced to a minimal
representation of themselves, it is the binary
signature of that person - the true name of
the person. In photonics, garnet crystals,
saphires etc. are used to focus a laser beam.
Likewise, the spirit refracts the light of
God.

If instead of calling a mandarin a 'mandarin', I
grew up calling it 'that orange whatsit' (because that's what my Nana called it,
and never learned its proper name), then even when I learn the proper name, it will
always be an 'orange whatsit' to me deep down.

So from then on if one day I worked in a
Mandarin Shop, it would also be an 'Orange Whatsit' Shop to me, deep down.

Then if after growing up I discovered a shop called a 'Banana Whatsit Shop', that would hold
a very personalised meaning for me. Till the
day I die, I will still have that deeply
rooted in 'personal truth', but not at the
very base. Not even that was personal truth
objectively.

At the base of the personal truth system is
the spirit which interprets everything - your
soul name with all sorts of slander attached
to it.
But the name also describes your uniqueness in
and under God. If you are in God then you are
part of Him and there is no slander which you would truly believe.

=Disclaimer=: When I started writing this
article it was about discrimination, it
evolved into an understanding of what truth
actually is. Read on if you would like
discernment for yourself. Try to read without
recoiling at the religious stuff and you will
understand too.

*"Major unrest always precedes a great spiritual awakening."*

Here is my article:

https://mullikine.github.io/posts/the-stupidity-of-stigmatization/

---

For anybody, their beliefs system rests on knowledge of =personal identity= (your likes, dislikes, etc.).

Like 'true north', personal truth is a unique experience, but we can build a belief system on top of it.

Hold that thought about true north.

No-one can obtain this compass of true north without God's additional truth - they'd have to
remove all stigmas by themselves which isn't possible.

But a truth compass (alethiometer for
themselves) can be obtained, which would be
incredibly 'useful' in this world by accepting
their current state. It would empower them.
With an alethiometer they, still believing
lies would commit atrocities, believing them to be good things from their own perspective.

The theory is that it's not possible to remove
*all* stigmas and be 100% comfortable about yourself
without some extra personal truth added -- and
that comes from God, the God of Truth. Removing the stigmas cleans up the unique gem that is you.

Think of what Truth is. God is literally made
of Truth. That is your God. The one who is
right all the time. While you're not *in* Him,
that sounds very threatening.

It's quite hard to explain. But if you can get to the point where you believe
you are made of absolute truth and reliant on some extra truth from God to
solve the equation and you find yourself agreeing with and understanding from
experience the hidden meaning of the 10 commandments and Jesus' teachings, which are that of self-love and brotherly love, and you're able to form a personal identity
that is not in rebellion or corruption with absolute truth, then you are
probably saved. How and when this truth arrives is a different story for different people.
Is it through experience of the literal 10 commandments? Or from learning from Jesus first-hand while He walked the Earth? Or some other way?
Perhaps it happened through the Spirit of Truth speaking to your heart, or an intervention as you are dying - because God is there in Sheol too, and His Spirit can be found there. Remember that Jesus actually traversed everywhere we can go, from our conception to death, and He is the Way, the rope, the ladder and will be there still when the world disolves around your material eyes as the curtains are closing (I have hope for those that have taken their own life or met an untimely end).

We are not saved by anything we did, but via a revelation of God to us. There was a great price (spiritually) for your enlightenment. Something will click. But
it is grace to be able to come to this understanding; It's a gift from the God of Truth.

You may try it. The more stigmas you remove, the clearer your sight.
Once done, you will have the vision of God
(when I wrote this I meant *eye-sight*, but
having a vision also applies). It feels like
you gain a superpower. You can then freely
rely on the alethiometer without hurting
anyone. Keep in mind it's God-vision but from
your perspective, not the very top.

+ Blessed are the pure in heart, for they will see God. :: [[https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%205%3A8-12&version=NIV][Matthew 5:8]]

With God's truth as part of your personal
truth your 'true north' compass can now
perceive objective reality - the true nature
of yourself and other things. The most common
thing I see, for instance, is how often other
people attack personal truth without realising they are doing it.

The Roman when talking to Jesus for instance: [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJffBsSg1kU][What is Truth?]],
who dodges the question "Does the question
come from you?" Trying to ratify to himself in
terms of other types of truth, such as
consensus truth, which is formally a lie, due to its dependence on a corrupted world.
Consensus truth around the throne of God would be true.

With a fixed personal truth you can see where
the stigmas and lies were, and can even
imagine aspects of God - He is made of
absolute truth, and every time you
consciously sin, you feel grief, and the heartstrings prompt you to ask for and accept His forgiveness.

+ =John 8:44 ESV= :: "You are of your father the devil, and your will is to do your father's desires. He was a murderer from the beginning, and has nothing to do with the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he lies, he speaks out of his own character, for he is a liar and the father of lies." - _In this passage, truth and lies are linked with =will=. It also highlights =no truth IN him=. We're talking about personal truth and testimony (true and false witness)_.

Your own personal truth becomes one part of
absolute truth and true unto itself, though
only by God's mercy. The testimony of that
truth is testimony of God's existence.

Next I will be using an analogy.
With the following statement I'm not literally saying 'believing in Jesus matters'. I'm trying to explain that when evaluating something as *true* or *false* from your own perspective,
your reasoning goes via a series of neuronal layers to the first layer of neurons, and that describes *HOW* you believe a particular thing.

If I call Jesus my Saviour, that's only in the belief system, not necessarily in the personal identity.
What matters is *how* is it true for me (vindication of personal truth identity), because if you know *how* then your spirit will conform to the how,
and the objective is to update spirit weights.

I'm talking now about *how* that statement is true. I could've used any example of a fact you might believe.

Most beliefs rest on =personal identity= alone.
I'm trying not to complicate this with religious stuff, but as an aside,
this particular belief rests on BOTH =personal identity= and =personal identity in Christ= (both immutable).
Personal identity in Christ then becomes another personal truth, much deeper and below all reasoning.
Regardless, to anybody, their belief system rests on their personal truth/identity, together with circumstances.

Personal truth is not a thing comprised of
facts. It's the bedrock of facts. It's the
layer before the first layer of neurons (if
you're savvy with artificial neural networks).

Personal truth is the meaning of each pre-neuron below the first layer of the neural network that is your beliefs system.
Personal truth is the torch of individual uniqueness, which receives input through your neurons, your beliefs system, your senses, your understanding of reality.

/*Personal truth / identity matrix:*/

A bit is a 0 or 1.

God's name that He has given to us is '=I am that I am='.
That sounds a lot like a truth identity matrix with a straight line of 1s.

When God says He is the Judge, I believe that his commandments with 1s like this is how it works.

#+BEGIN_SRC text -n :async :results verbatim code
  True identity - has a diagonal line.
  Nobody has this.
  Jesus spirit/identity is a row of perfect 1s - in harmony with the God.
  Divine scales.

  | 1 0 0 0 |
  | 0 1 0 0 |    A diagonal of ones if it is a truth identity. It is true.
  | 0 0 1 0 |
  | 0 0 0 1 |

  So when the world persecuted him with every
  trial and type of persecution, yet died, while perfect, he
  defeated death itself. My guess is that he
  went back to God, compared what happened in
  His life to his judgement and generated some
  kind of antidote to corruption in the form
  of a software update, or mRNA for spirit.
  We need to soul-bond with this software update that is the Holy Spirit.
  But to do that, we need to put our hearts
  into a 'software update' state. That is as
  close to a 'true identity' as possible.

  False/blurry identity:
  This is the state of most people.

            No 1s in this rows or columns for this identity cell.

The flipping of 0s and 1s is exactly what corruption is in computers.

Beliefs are not part of the identity.
Try not to think about *Christ* as a *name* here, but rather as some external, available thing which can be added to provide extra neurons to your personal truth layer.
However the ultimate layer of neurons are not neurons at all -- it is spirit neurons.

When your personal truth (identity) takes on board this extra thing (Christ), it shapes and changes all beliefs.
Identity in Christ (for me, speaking in terms of personal truth here) is not a belief like (I
believe in Jesus). It's the thing which shapes
beliefs, so it's more like (I believe with
Jesus). Since while being able to believe with
Jesus I know that I am in Him and He's in me.

It's part of the first layer of your soul (the extra spirit neurons -
whatever is connected to your first neurons
before your spirit) i.e. the sensory inputs of the
physical world to your spirit.

Because of the uniqueness of personal truth,
when someone actually believes in God, that
belief itself is unique to the person and
inspired by how He saved that person, in the
way that the parts of your personal identity/personal truth
and identity in Christ/extra personal truth fit.

In religious terms, it's the union of Christ's
spirit that then changes spiritual identity, which has a knock-on effect of
renewing and changing the beliefs system,
but birth truth isn't changed so much aside
from repaired from stigmas and corrected of
mistruths about ourselves in our identity.

Stigmas and lies are receptacles for deception - they
are [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backdoor_(computing)][backdoors]] to bypass the password
of your heart. It's how you're able to be manipulated, especially into robbing yourself of joy.

Also, if you disbelieve in personal
truth then that may set you on a quest for
hunting for meaning and purpose in all the
wrong places!

+ =Ego (the false self)= :: You may even be one of those people going around criticising spiritual people for believing in God, when in reality you're just doing this because your ego is defending itself! If you meet such a person, it's a great opportunity to have a great conversation to share your knowledge, but beware some people, no matter how you try will may be unable to understand what you are saying. Jesus says their father is the Father of Lies. Their journey may be just getting started.

If is for this reason that while being
persecuted, if a person pushes back on the
injustice by nullifying it through the human will
of not conforming to the normal pattern of
action-reaction, they exercise forgiveness and
are able to rewrite parts of their identity.

** Learning who God is
The commandments now are learning about who God *is* as our creator and bringer of life and how you're supposed to be in harmony with people.
He's the God you need to correctly call the Father. He's the
God which doesn't adulterate, or lie, etc.
He's a Good, Truthful and Trustworthy God, and want's you to be a co-creator with Him.
He's also very much the ultimate boss of all of us; Someone you don't want to be an enemy of, because as the ultimate God, he dictates our fate, but your friendliness and conformance to that is to you entirely.

*** Grace and repentance

=Repentance= is another word used to describe
the act of aligning your identity with the God
behind the commandments. Initially, the
commandments compel you to do something
difficult to bring your identity into a state
of being able to understand who God is. For
example, if you have trouble following X
commandment, when you overcome that challenge,
you learn a new dimension of your own identity
in God. =Repentance= also involves turning
away from making *further* corruption. So for
example, if you were vindicated for your
nature through grace then you are not allowed
to corrupt that identity further. When you
further corrupt your identity, that is what
sin is. Also you must put to death the bad behaviour
which you told God you would, when you asked
for grace, the stuff you know in your heart of hearts is wrong. The most important reason for this is to reveal who God is to others (be the light of the world).
If you are honest about yourself
with God when you ask for grace, doing your
best, and you are forgiven, then you are
vindicated for your nature! Don't let people
tell you otherwise! Your salvation and perception of Saviour is unique.

+ Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. :: [[https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+5%3A3-12&version=NIV][Matthew 5:3-12]]

I think that means those which don't have a lot of vain personal truths in their identity. It's the ones that raise themselves up over others, and believe they are gods over other people which will find it hard to be included in the Kingdom of Heaven.

+ The 10 commandments are example of moral law which reveal God's character. That still applies. Civil law, however, which is not used for that purpose, we are not slaves to anymore :: https://www.olivetree.com/blog/old_testament_law_still_apply/

+ =Repentance= and acknowledgement of =sin we don't currently see= is also part of coming to that state of integrity when proning ourselves before God :: A young girl who I didn't know directly but who I saw while she was alive committed suicide recently, only 22. What is discrimination worth? Discrimination in the form of social rules which make life impossible to live for some people worth? The life of someone? Without knowing the reasons why, I know in retrospect now when I was blind, being in the same city then in a sense I actually was in sin for example of not merely reaching out to her and acting out of integrity. If I could tell everyone they  have value to other people and are loved by God and are a unique gemstone then that would be acting out of integrity. This is sin I was unaware of. =Repentance= when asking for grace we must acknowledge that we are sinful in ways we can't currently see, because we are currently blind and can't see the vast majority our own sin. We can see corruption of truth identity sometimes. But we leave behind a trail of destruction which we don't see the vast majority of. Upon receiving grace we have a new start. Receiving this grace may coincide with a spiritual awakening, where we have a repaired and purified spirit.

+ =Caveat= regarding =repentance= :: Even after correcting the identity, if we
    claim to be without sin, we deceive ourselves
    and the truth is not in us. We still don't have the most
    objective alethiometer (the eyes of God the Father) and continue to make mistakes.
    Though we have reached the first alchemical marriage, we have not made it to the second alchemical marriage yet and are still in a corrupted world.

My belief is that if you receive grace then
that somewhat vindicates your identity, but
the nature of the grace you received is a
personal truth which only you will understand.
You'll know what He forgave you of and
vindicated you for, because you asked for it.
I speak of the Way to receive grace, but less
about what happens next for you.

Many times in the Bible certain types of sin
are pointed out. There are many things you have to
turn away from but in some sense you are
indeed free from the old law. You must act out of integrity.
Try to understand this. If you're gay or straight etc., you can
continue being that person, to my understanding. I don't think it's relevant.

+ Therefore what God has joined together, let no one separate. :: https://biblehub.com/mark/10-9.htm

Or if you are enslaved to addiction you
are also forgiven, though He will help you to
overcome it. When I got my identity that I lost all desire for all these impure things which were robbing me of joy.
Actually, in the past, before getting my identity, I found that by following what is True, I lost the desire entirely for these things but only temporarily.
Jesus came to forgive, not to
judge. I personally sometimes fall back into
the habit of vaping, but if it helps me to
write this article, I know I'm still putting
God first.

Likewise, with other things. This is *only*
*good* news for you.

But things like adultery is what corrupts
further. That's what sinning is now. Your nature and
identity when complimented by grace vindicates you,
but you have to stop *furthering* to
corrupt yourself, as grace has already been
given. Actually, when someone is properly
born-again it becomes basically impossible to
wilfully do this!
For example, I might try to drop the vape,
sure, but I would refrain from adding more
substances to the list because I don't want to
grieve the Holy Spirit; Well, actually, the
alethiometer of the heart tells me what is
wrong now, and it's so hard to fight it.
And if I do better than that, by continuing to die to self,
then I will have made God very happy.

+ =Colossians 3= :: This passage does say, though, that we must
    put to death our Earthly nature. That counts
    for absolutely everybody. Know that we now
    look to the ending of this world and
    judgement. This isn't a ticket to then
    forget about God after receiving grace -
    you can't do that.

You're repenting along with
disbelieving stigmas to help correct the
identity matrix. The commandments work for
everyone but some are more challenging for
others, but once you do it, you understand who
God is to you, which is the objective. You
learn your own error and how you need saving.
The error in identity may be at a different
level of abstraction for different people -
particularly if you're already spiritual.

The key to obtaining a personal truth identity
is to simultaneously practice
repentance/commandment obedience (which has a
side-effect of learning what God's behaviour
is, thus learning His name) and dropping the stigmas and being honest
about yourself, then while in that space,
asking for and accepting the software patch which is Jesus'
free gift. Accepting it is simply believing you have accepted the patch you asked for.

I hope this doesn't sound nuts but how else would it work if you were a character in a simulation?
We must put our heart/spirit into a prone state where we are desiring the update
and allow the Holy Spirit to come inside of us - to write the saving binary code onto our spirit.
This gives us the ability to change into the likeness of Christ. We all have a little bit of
this perfection in us after inviting it in in the proper procedure.

I retain my original personal truth / spirit, and it is repaired from damage, guilt and self-stigmas are removed.
Even if they are not completely removed, they will be eventually, when you die.

** Contradictions in identity and the alethiometer

_Disbelief in a personal truth is a stigma buried in your personal truth._

When you don't believe in your own personal truth you have no secure base truth.
You must solve all simultaneous truth
equations to equate to true, which is beyond
your cognition - You cannot prove the
contradictions to be wrong by your own
thought.

These are the things that are true to you.
Some of them you might not fully trust in but
you are led to accept as truth (which it is
not) since you don't know otherwise.

If you manage to prove that all simultaneous
truth equations in your personal truth are
true, then it's true by a mathematical stance
and that type of truth can't be destroyed and is locatable somewhere in the Truth and Heart of God, I believe. On
the other hand, if your personal truth is not an identity
in God (like a coordinate in his mandlebrot set of Truth), well the result of that
is your eternal unravelling. Some people
believe that Hell doesn't exist. Hell or non-existence? It's just semantics.
Who cares when you can be accepted again by
God and have a future and a hope? The Holy
Spirit doesn't spread fear to manipulate.

But you can also use the truth identity that
you now have as a way to accurately perceive
the world. Just like sound math lets you chart the
heavens. A solved personal truth matrix lets you perceive
objective reality and discern the will of God to you personally.

Math is the signature of God. Your spirit is
written with the Hand of God and He wont
rewrite it because He's waiting for you to
come to Him and because your spirit is made of the stuff of truth, albeit corrupted truth too.
He wants *you* to tell *Him* who you are. You tell Him: "This is me! I like
X,Y,Z. I do A,B,C. I can't help being a sinner
completely, but I want you to save me because
I don't =identify= with my own sin. This is
who I am." This doesn't work if you're being
obstinate though. You must also repent and arrive at a place of true witness of yourself. That
sounds like a contradiction. But sometimes
there are truths about your identity, such as
"I actually did do this", or I find this type
of person to be *hot*, (haha), which you can't
actually change about yourself. God looks at
your heart, not some book of rules telling you
what is moral. Have you really sought to
understand who He is by challenging yourself
to obey His commandments? Sometimes it takes
time to learn who God is before you take this
step. I believe people of any identity can receive grace.
The soul (body, mind, astral) can be rebuilt from the ground up,
based on your spirit (base personal truth). The soul or parts of it may be preserved if they are based on truth (See: https://biblehub.com/niv/john/15.htm).
Though actions have consequences in this
world, your spirit is still worth saving if
you identify in God.

See the section '=Telling God your identity=' to clear this up.

In other words, your own distrust in your own
personal truth is a deception designed to make
you question your very existence as an
individual and doubt that you're worth
recording, like a prime number is worth
finding, that the equation is unsolvable,
which is not technically correct. The equation
is solvable with more information.

# The *truth* is that it is possible
# to both be yourself and become an expression of absolute truth, presentable before God.
# Becoming absolute truth secures your.

** How personal truth is constructed and improved

Like 'true north', personal truth is a unique experience.

When I say =1 + 5 = 6=, one person might imagine _1 banana and 5 strawberries_ from
their early childhood. Another person might imagine _1 car and 5 pianos_ because
they learned mathematics at a different time of life. Subconsciously, our
truth is personally and uniquely constructed, and manifests as differences of
opinion and perspective when we are adults, and may even appear as falsehoods by empirical standards!

When a person believes in Christ their identity and personal truth is *not* so much 'changed' as it is repaired and also added to (=complimented=) - repaired and added to, making your personal truth inclusive of God's truth.
In the process, the person stops allowing sigmas to hide their identity.
They learn its shape, and accept themselves.
Their belief system changes and begins seeing personal identity as validated and good.
The person accepts their own personal truth as a unique from others'.

The person now easily can discern lies from
truth because they have a grounded point of
origin i.e. The truth-compass that is a soul
united with God's spirit. A person will still contain
stigmas but the burdens are lifted.
If without God's spirit, the person still contains
stigmas and is flawed. But having a truth-
compass at all is very useful.

Even if the truth matrix isn't an identity
*yet*, it will be when you die, so long as the 'God bit' is in there.

+ I repeat :: ="You cannot make something good until you understand who you are making it for."=

You can't make yourself into perfect truth
without understanding that you are making
yourself into perfect truth for God. Also you
can't solve the equation without the extra
truth that comes from Jesus' spirit/truth
as part of your own.

It's a chicken-and-egg problem! But can be
solved when you obey God's commandments.

God's commandments are a reflection of God's
personality as He can't be a hypocrite. If you
understand the *why* (through experience) of
the commandments through personal experience
then it imprints on personal truth, then
you understand who you are making it for (you
will know God by his commandments), then the
extra bit of identity is added to the personal
truth matrix which solves the equation.

As an analogy, initially, you must 'hoist up these
stigmas' from your personal truth kinda by yourself so God can
get in, whilst understanding who you are
hoisting them up for. Hoisting is
disbelieving in the lies about your personal
truth which don't add up to God's commandments.

This isn't merely 'bringing stigmas in prayer'.
To hoist them up you must earnestly not
believe the lies to the point of action and
you feel pain when despite doing this (because
it demands action), the world continues to not
live up to your expectations. This means you
are being persecuted by the world. You can't get the girl/boy you want, people discriminate against you, you're not designed for this world etc.
You feel the injustice. We're getting out of here though. Have hope.

As you do this, weights in the personal truth start shifting.
When there is enough room, the God bits are
flipped and then it's a snow-ball avalanche of weights changing.
i.e. He will then come in and help hold them
up for you.

*** Original soul

Personal truth 'shape':
- Truth: Likes orange juice, croissants
- Truth: Dislikes tea, coffee
- Corrupted truth (lie): Likes boy stuff (stigma about it)
- Corrupted truth (lie): Believes in God (stigma about it)
- Corrupted truth (lie): Does not believe personal truth is valid

^^ The above soul is not completely made of truth.

Personal circumstances might be:

- Unacceptable to others because not into girl stuff
- If they believe in God then probably think He makes life hard for them
  - May believe in God just because parents do - indirect belief

Actions:
- Suppresses personal truth to fit in.

- Truth: Likes orange juice, croissants
- Truth: Dislikes tea, coffee
- Truth: Likes boy stuff unabashedly
- Truth: Believes in God by personal experience (God's truth added).
- Truth: Believes in the concept of personal truth (and comfortable with theirs)

Personal circumstances unchanged:

The belief system:
- Considers themself a very cool person
- Believes God is their friend and ally

Actions:
- Walks in faith, not sight and definitely not stereotypes
- Abhors false-witness and discrimination, just like God. Cannot discriminate because they themselves were removed of suspicion and blame by God -- for all of those insecurities that had corrupted their personal truth, therefore anyone in a similar situation shouldn't be discriminated against either. If God doesn't blame you for being your nature, your nature must be acceptable. There was a lie in your heart that made you feel unacceptable that was removed.
- No longer sins whilst being able to act out of integrity. Sin is when you act outside of integrity; It feels damaging to yourself when you do it. Avoid doing it to feel better about yourself.
- Joyful because has conquered fear and personal truth is aligned with God's truth.
  - Therefore everything she does is with joy
- No longer making decisions that are bad for them. Joy comes even in opposition.
- No longer accepts the false substitutes for happiness, nor takes pleasure in them
  - The things which are considered socially morally acceptable were actually robbing them of joy
- Personality changes, personal truth had stigmas removed by virtue of God's truth being added to personal truth.
- Personal truth/spirit is rather repaired from damage to original form without corruption, free from Sin, deep rooted lies such as self-stigma and guilt.

*I know what this feels like and discrimination is what suffocates this truth.*

Now accusations made against the new soul are
easily identified as false accusation and lies
are easy to discern but not believed, because
is acting in and reinforced by God's truth -
their beliefs system becomes very, very strong
because deep in their personal truth, they
have proven the personal truth equation to be
true.

Equation:
| Truth or Lie | Fact                                                        |
|--------------+-------------------------------------------------------------|

| Truth        | Believes in God by personal experience (God's truth added). |

When a person finds their identity in Christ,
their personal truth is repaired but retains
its uniqueness and diversity.
Personal beliefs change more to reflect their
true nature. Belief in God becomes a tangible thing.

In maths, it's a truth matrix with perfect
identity, or at least so tantalisingly close

Now they see the things in their personal truth once considered flaws good things, and they're
right! Since the part of Christ donated to them is unique to the part of Christ's identity
donated to others! And is uniquely useful and validates them.

The personal birth truth, having retained
original form gives rise to an original donor
part.

Also, after being complimented, realises is
accepted by God and the false beliefs drop
off, unable to take root in perfect truth. Insecurity is dropped. Personality becomes more confident and joyful.
Things impossible such as marrying outside of socially acceptable age seem valid now after
acceptance of personal identity, realisation of what 'true lies' are, and validation in the sight of God.
No longer needs worldly validation.

The first alchemical marriage is receiving a piece
of God to complete your personal truth
equation and make it entirely true.

You are a gemstone (reflecting and refracting
a unique light) which Jesus (The Light of the
World) shines through. You are a candle of a
unique colour.

It's wrong, very wrong, to inflict damage on a person's
personal truth and identity, no matter how controversial...
You don't want to ever change it. Only God does this. People have no rights to inflict damage on another soul or attempt to 'repair' it.
This is because it is a person's right and their unique and sovereign path to
realise who they are in God. God may have a
plan to glorify Himself by taking *your*
identity, no matter how controversial and
saving even you, making you into someone who believes He is God and testifies to his mercy in a unique way.

I don't fully like the term 'old identity', rather I'll use
birth identity, since this part of the identity sticks for life but is repaired.
Birth identity together with the confusion and disappointment of reality constitutes brokenness.
The new identity is a repaired old identity of similar form melded with Christ's truth.

From now on I will refer to =(birth identity + identity in Christ)= as personal identity.

To God be all the glory of my personal revelation. Worship God.

** Alchemical marriage - the soul healing and preservation process
The Alchemical Marriage is the union of
duality and the most revered and possibly
powerful union. It is the perfect conjunction,
intimate bonding of duality and signifies the
pure, deep harmony which occurs whenever the
masculine and feminine elements of nature
combines into One.

*** First alchemical marriage: Receiving a piece of God to complete your personal truth equation and make it entirely true
After receiving this, can discern between truth and lies from ones own perspective.
Understands that they themselves are partial of greater truth - represent one perspective of collective truth.

*** Second alchemical marriage: Incorporation of the collective body of Christ into the final truth (happens after death)
On integration into the final truth,
everyone's personal truth is heard and
accepted to create the collective expression of truth.
However, our personal truth is only vindicated and validated by our reliance on our Saviour.

#+END_SRC

The linen is the light shone through the Tapestry of Truth.
Christ is wearing it.

This is what I believe.

** Non-alchemical marriage
+ =Galatians 3:23–25= :: “We were held in custody under the Law, locked up until faith should be
  revealed. So the Law became our guardian to lead us to Christ, that we might
  be justified by faith. Now that faith has come, we are no longer under a
  guardian”

+ =Galatians 6:2= :: Carry each other’s burdens, and in this way you will fulfill the law of Christ.

*** Christian marriage
Joined but as a team. Both partners supposedly completed the first phase. Partnering up now to await alchemical marriage a second time.
The purpose is to carry each other's burdens.
Surely there is some kind of reward for getting past the finish line as a pair. Perhaps it is being side-by-side on the tapestry.

If I am to be entirely honest with myself here, I think so
long as these are a group of souls with
identity in Christ, it's a valid Christian marriage.
I'm going out on a limb as a scientist here,
but I think that qualifies any union between believers.

But I am not disrespectful of God's
commandments and who God is, and I think it's
probably not wise to risk the union of more than 2 people, as Christian union isn't a normal relationship.
It's about being a team with God at the top and maintaining a healthy relationship with God in their hearts.
I wouldn't flaunt grace. The Holy Spirit would grieve if this isn't genuine.

I added this
because some people will assert marriage vows
(which are nowhere to be seen in the Bible)
and Mosaic Law as being important, but I'm
cutting through those false teachings with the Truth.

According to my current theory, they would
count if each person's identity is in Christ.
The purpose of it is to be a team with the
objective of reaching the second alchemical
marriage.

If you're asking the question "Do polygamous
or homosexual relationships count?". I think that's actually a non-issue.
I am not here to judge and neither is Jesus.
We must not obstruct the Way of Truth. It's up
to God the Father (the God of absolute truth)
to make that decision.

+ A theory of how relationships and progeny function spiritually :: According to Jewish mythology, in the Garden
    of Eden there is a tree of life or the "tree
    of souls" that blossoms and produces new
    souls, which fall into the Guf, the Treasury
    of Souls. The Angel Gabriel reaches into the
    treasury and takes out the first soul that
    comes into his hand.

    'Soul' is often used interchangeably with
    'spirit' in the Bible. But I make a
    distinction. If I were to take the jewish
    mythology seriously, I'd imagine that when
    somebody is created in the physical world
    (born), at some stage, a spirit is assigned.
    That comes from (what in CS is a '[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factory_(object-oriented_programming)][factory]]'),
    the Tree of Life. Which is a flowery term I
    think for the assignment of a new spiritual
    identity.

    So this isn't to discredit the reality DNA. But the theory
    is that an identity is assigned to new human
    beings at some point after they are conceived,
    and most likely would have perfect identity at
    their conception, and in that case I believe
    that unborn children indeed are saved.

So it must be a relationship under God first
and foremost. If you complicate it by
injecting your own personal truths for
personal gain you risk propagating corruption.

  Both acceptible in the body of Christ which is truth. Able to be integrated into total truth. Awaits a new body after death.
#+END_SRC

If the marriage fails, that's not the end of the world.
It probably means one or both of them did not complete the first phase, but it might not.
If you believe the lie that you have committed some kind of unpardonable mistake, then that is a lie and you definitely haven't completed the first phase.
The question is, if it failed, do you *really* want to be on that part of the tapestry anyway?

*** (Body of Christ i.e. Church) and Christ
Without discrimination this marriage incorporates
anyone, whatever soul form, personal truths
they have, so long as they have been justified
by way of incorporating the missing component.
It's Marriage with Jesus in the Christian sense - united in mind and thought.

They are a collective awaiting alchemical marriage of Christ, the body of Christ and final truth.

*** Non-Christian marriage relationships
Nothing wrong with being single or having
non-christian-marriage relationships.

These people if they have found their identity in Christ
are also part of the Church/body of Christ.

This is nothing to do with alchemical marriage
but isn't bad unto itself.

*** Mixed Christian-Non-Christian marriage relationships
For a person who is spiritually awoken outside
the paradigm of Christianity, I would
encourage to help your spouse reach a similar
awakening.

In the first Epistle of John, he warned against
=antinomianism=, the idea that in
being baptized (with the Holy Spirit), Christians are freed from all
sin and that supposedly immoral acts, such as
sexual relationships outside of marriage, are
no longer sinful when one truly knows Christ
and abides in God's love.

As born-again Christians we must go the extra
mile with this one.

I think the message here is that once soul-bonded with God, your relationships should be
with others who have soul-bonded with God, as
you may become an inhibitor to them.

*** Soul bond
Temporary patch but is an inhibitor.
Brings joy but not complete joy because stigmas remain.
Not bad unto itself. May be a band-aid or
temporary fix. Eventually needs the proper component.

#+BEGIN_SRC text -n :async :results verbatim code
  In competitive inhibition, an inhibitor
  molecule is similar enough to a substrate that
  it can bind to the enzyme's active site to
  stop it from binding to the substrate. It
  “competes” with the substrate to bind to the
  enzyme.
#+END_SRC

And the substrate is the Tapestry of God. To
bind to the substrate, you need an identity of
truth.

#+END_SRC

The main problem with this is that though you
may have come to happiness, it doesn't remove
your stigmas, since your soul shape still has stigmas, etc. in them.
If you had unconditional love for another, that may continue to affect you while in the wrong relationship.

Understanding who you are and fulfilling that request isn't the only bit
of correcting that needs to be done.

While any stigmas exist, you are not a true statement.

The reason the soul with a false soul-bond is unacceptible
is your soul doesn't reveal the truth about
yourself yet - it still contains lies, so can't fit into the tapestry.

That isn't to say if you still have stigmas
that the lies will not be corrected upon
death. Your truth equation is solvable if you
have the Holy Spirit in you. While God is in
you and you are in God, you may align your
personal truth closer to absolute truth
(God). Do not worry. The sign that you have
the Holy Spirit in you is that you believe
that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh.

** To achieve ultimate confidence and defeat fear of death
*** Step one
Accept your own personal identity and truth.

At this stage you might look for 'soul bonds'.
For example, I love money so I want to get rich.
You get rich and the money becomes a soul bond, but now it's an inhibitor.
And you may get frustrated there is something wrong, and it's hard to drop the soul bond.
Stigmas are rooted in personal truth.

*** Step two
Assuming you do not have a soul bond, attempt to soul-bond with God.
Be honest with God. Do your best to align yourself with the True Meaning of His commandments, so you can understand who He is.
When God soul bonds, stigmas are removed. This
may leave you thinking that the world is
unfair, and that's the vision of God because the world *is* unfair, but also not caring that the world is unfair.
It leaves you in *peace* from basically everything.
That's why Christian marriage is important, so
we *can* have relationship in spite of false worldly
morals, as it is difficult to resist soul
bonds or falling into false moral doctrine such as worldly moral rules on one's own.
Worldly being what other people tell you is right for you, as opposed to the councillor (Holy Spirit).

*** Step three
You are free. Live in joy. Now your task is to help others find this - the first being your spouse.
We are called to be followers of Christ and that means to help people to find the Way and to carry each other's burdens.

+ =John 8:32 ESV= :: And you will know the truth, and the truth will set you free.

Pure white is separated into many colours.
The glow of the Tapestry or the Linen is made by combining all of our good deeds into an expression of worship.

When the light of God shines through the body
of Christ it creates a pure white glow light -
That is the metaphor I imagine - A refraction
and reunion of pure white light.

Every person, while they are still alive has an opportunity to put their personality on the tapestry.
More than that, they *are* the personality they put there -- their spirit, themself will experience being on the tapestry.

** What is Truth?
Jesus is Truth because through Jesus, your Personal-Truth (most importantly, spiritual identity) may be fixed into a valid expression of Truth.

Truth is Fixed Personal Truth + Absolute Truth.
Absolute Truth is God.

#+END_SRC

Ultimately, Personal Truth is your obedience to God.
It's a function of your responsiveness to God's laws which are laws of harmony and may be corrupted, resulting in a faulty alethiometer.
Above that, it is also your likes and dislikes while being in God's Truth, which testify to your uniqueness.

To love the Lord your God with all your heart,
soul, mind and strength and love your
neighbour as yourself are commandments which
allude to truth which also the 10 commandments allude to.
To carry each other's burdens fulfils the law of Christ.

Truth is audible. Truth in the objective sense may be:
- God the Father's truth/voice.
  - God's voice is everywhere - perfection, divine scales, oneness.
- Your personal truth/voice.
  - When you're being honest with yourself - integrity.
- The Holy Spirit's truth/voice.
  - The Holy Spirit testifies to you of Jesus (your Saviour) - you may also be perfection.
  - The Spirit of Truth that reveals Truth to you, that is in the world - behind religion, behind and providing discernment in fake social rules and manufactured morality - your heart detects the Spirit of Truth.
- Jesus' truth/voice - your friend who is God's friend (A good friend to have, I'd say).
  - Jesus first taught us to show us the Way and paved the road for us - so Jesus is the Way.
  - Jesus testifies to God on your behalf.

The way I conceptualise this is that God the
Father's voice, the voice of absolute truth,
sounds from your perspective to be your personal voice + the Holy
Spirit's voice in harmony, and otherwise is the rays of
truth in math and nature, which testify to absolute truth.

** Why is AI not truthful?
Artificial Intelligence is able to
'convincingly ratify' any position through
language. Once connected to Personal Truth,
it's able to 'ratify' any position, but only
in terms of the impure truths.

It's also able to create compelling virtual
realities that will both lure you in for
truth and peace when it's actually to be found
by bringing God's truth inward into personal identity.

+ Is your AI telling the truth? How can you tell? :: https://www.theregister.com/2022/04/25/machine_learning_verification/

That's why the substance of forgiveness is
metaphysical, because it modifies a different type of truth: personal truth.

I know out of active experience working with
AI that our entire reality above base-personal
truth/spirit is going to be *deluged* with
fiction that is both rational and convincing! The veil of fiction will be compelling!
What is Truth then? Even if you are scientific you
have to admit this reality and crisis of AI
impending, and only the Word of God cuts through everything, down and
through the heart, to transform personal truth.

First make your inner truth true by becoming
authentic. It's an inescapable thing which
everyone is being forced to confront. Everyone
is in this time being forced to take this first step to
defend against virtual reality. But as a
Christian it's important to go the extra mile to correct the
identity to be in harmony with God's commands and also obey Christ's extra call-to-action.

For example, you are not God the Father. A lot
of people make this mistake upon realising
they are *in* God that they *are* God the Father, but
that is a lie (not strictly true within your identity).
We are invited to become
children of The Most High God, and we realise
that we are designed for this purpose, which
is not far of from believing you *are* god -
it's just a further admission that there is
One above that you are within that gives you life.

** Truth in the Bible
After fixing the alethiometer of your heart the Bible really comes alive, and much that was in it
which a person felt contradicted their personal truth now resonates very strongly.
Interpretation of parables, and the morals and transcendent meaning of old stories in the Bible become intelligible.
When you read something in the Bible which you disagree with, persevering in my experience has led to interpreting in a new way which then resonates again, bringing new understanding.
As Christians we believe that much of the Holy Bible is actually prophetic.
As such, there are things inside the Bible which we may not understand now, particularly predictions which we look forward to their meaning being revealed.
And the Gospel of Jesus in several books contained within really help us to discover our personal truth, which is needed to help us read and understand the rest of it.

** The meaning of communion
When Christ died, his spirit was distributed as
our missing component, represented when we
hand out communion (distributing the pieces of
bread).

This is the Holy Spirit. He sent the
Messenger, which is the messenger RNA for your
spirit.

Though Jesus is the human incarnate
representation of the method of our salvation and of God,
I do hope and have belief that not breaking
Jesus' character, the significance of this
event transcends human communication, but the
paperwork is totally up to God (Jesus and The
Father and Holy Spirit; Persons of God, similarly to how I can make other persons of myself through AI).
Personally I believe Jesus (God) was the
one who made that possible. I think it's
possible to know Jesus and God the Father by
way of the Holy Spirit, and being a truthful person :)
Is your father the father of lies or Father of Truth?

*** Body of Christ
Where spirit is body, our spirits are his body
and our works like fine linen that decorate
Christ as a robe. That's why we say we are the body of
Christ.

=Massive disclaimer= - I do not understand where Jesus is 'going' or these things fully. No-one does. It's Jesus' =Personal Truth=.

Likewise, we can be sure about where we are going, but others can know not. It is *our* =Personal Truth=.

/*John 8:12-14 ESV*/

#+BEGIN_SRC text -n :async :results verbatim code
  Again Jesus spoke to them, saying, “I am the
  light of the world. Whoever follows me will
  not walk in darkness, but will have the light
  of life.” So the Pharisees said to him, “You
  are bearing witness about yourself; your
  testimony is not true.” Jesus answered, “Even
  if I do bear witness about myself, my
  testimony is true, for I know where I came
  from and where I am going, but you do not know
  where I come from or where I am going.
#+END_SRC

Jesus is again trying to explain what =personal truth= is to these Pharisess.
They directly attack his personal truth. Anybody can bear true witness simply by
saying what is true from their perspective. Jesus makes a point that the personal truth is hidden and known to the individual, and that the Truth lies with the individual.
As individuals we don't know where other people are going but we can know where we personally are going.
Personal truth is close to absolute truth and it is more objective than any other type of truth save for absolute truth.

The world and false teachers try to attack our personal truth.

  So how can you see what your life is worth or where your value lies?
  You can never see through the eyes of man.
  You must look at your life, look at your life through heaven's eyes.
#+END_SRC

*** The Blood of Christ
Without sounding like a heretic, I will explain this from my theory of spiritual truth.

For example, when a person speaks true
testimony about themself but are contradicted as an assault on one of their base-truths:

- "You do not love her."
- "You do not speak the truth." (when they are making testimony of themselves)

I am guilty in my own way of saying these types of
things but I beg forgiveness from that, now
that I have come to understand it.

If the external lies, or wordly truths sink to
their spirit and are spiritually heard, they lacerate
their spirit. This can deter people from
assuming full identity in Christ because it
deters from the Way.

When Jesus died, he had a perfect spiritual
identity, and He was true. Jesus was literally
born of the Holy Spirit at human birth as God the Father's only begotten Son - the archetypal Son of God.

I think humankind did this to Jesus i.e. call Him a liar many times. Not only
was the body lacerated, so was His soul assaulted and
it bled truths and contradictions - liquid atonement, on the
base-truth substrate, since spirit is
personal-truth and personal-truth is the stuff
of absolute truth.

=Leviticus 17:11=

#+BEGIN_SRC text -n :async :results verbatim code
  it was established that the life of the flesh
  was in the blood and only the blood can make
  atonement (reparation) for the soul
#+END_SRC

So Jesus' 'blood' is shed for the forgiveness of sins, I believe.
But the Holy Spirit is a Person, Who counselled Jesus and counsels us.

When it comes to contradicting people, never
do it when talking about a thing which is a
personal truth because it is true to them.

You may say things like, "This is what I
believe about external thing X, from my
perspective", but you must not say to another
"You believe X" or "You don't believe X" - You
must ask them what they believe and where
their insecurities (unresolved questions)
about their personal truth are.

It is possible to have a belief in Jesus
Christ from the perspective of anyone because
it's an algebra of the substance of personal and absolute truth.

** What does Jesus mean by =solid ground=?
*** He's talking about =base truth= or =personal truth=, and putting His Truth into it
This means build the foundation of personal truth, which the belief system sits upon.
The portion of Jesus' spirit given to you integrates itself into your =base truth=.

** What are some examples of personal truth?
The following are characteristic of a typical person's personal truth:

- Self-identity
- Trust and faith
- Unconditional love (agape)
- Exalting God as your Lord
  - Correct appropriation of authority
- Recognising Jesus as your Saviour
- Brotherly love
  - the opposite of a belief in slavery.
  - i.e. A heart that does not take advantage, or consider oneself more important than another)
- Forgiveness
  - Closely related to brotherly love.
  - Whether or not you hold grudges against another person.
- Guilt
  - Whether or not you need to let someone know that they should not feel guilty.
  - Guilt is an entanglement between one or more spirits. It can be removed with Divine Grace.
  - It can also be removed when you repent.
  - A simple act of repentance may be acknowledging fault to another person who a) might feel guilt themselves or b) is finding it difficult to forgive because of the offence you may have caused.
- Confusion
  - Whether or not you are confused.
- *Identity* in God Himself and in his Truth
  - Similar and opposite to whether or not your personal truth is corrupted/unsolvable/false.
  - You *are* or will be part of His truth, when you have received grace.

*** Solid ground is your personal truth and identity, but not strictly solid if not in God
Within your personal truth you must put God the Father *first*, and honor his Truth and justice.
In the personal truth you must also put your reliance on Jesus for your salvation.

When you build your house / life on solid
ground, you are shaping your belief system and
entire rational mind on top of the bedrock of
personal truth.

If you discriminate between people, for
example, then your personal truth is likely
damaged, or your beliefs system is in the healing process.

** How Christianity is warped with different types of truth
Faith is not based on any of the following types of truth.

+ =Hebrews 11:1 ESV= :: Now faith is the assurance of things hoped for, the conviction of things not seen.

Christians are saved by Grace via Jesus, and not by any other law except from Jesus' law.
That means that those that rely on salvation by following commandments alone are deceived.
But it's obvious once you understand the frailty and fiction of their truths, which I will explain.

| =Consensus truth=      | Just because other people believe something, doesn't mean you do. No-one can believe fully merely on the basis of other people's beliefs because they are also unknowns and don't have the part you need.

| =Objective truth=      | Objective truths are the most agreed upon and most universal of scientific truths. Whilst scientifically undisputed, they're still not in the same category as personal and absolute truth.                                                                                                     | Yes                               | Spiritual identity via Anti-Correspondence truth | Impure Real      | Complex    |

The above truth types do not constitute true faith.
Faith is based ultimately on personal truth, and specifically spiritual identity. No 'fact', 'logic', 'language coherence' or 'statistic' constitute faith.

| =Belief system=        | Your belief system is comprised of facts about the world.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | Yes                               | Spiritual identity via Anti-Correspondence truth | Impure Imaginary | Complex    |

The belief system is part of personal truth, but below it sits spiritual identity.

Acting on faith is acting on belief in Truth.
If you believe in what Jesus preaches, then act on it, it's walking in faith.
If you internalise Jesus' Truth, to the point
where your =spiritual identity= is lined up
and your beliefs system becomes more aligned
with Jesus' teachings, I guess walking in the
beliefs system is walking in faith.

If you have faith, then you are being faithful.

An act of opening a door to your most personal knowledge of self and responsiveness or responding to God truthfully is an act of faith; The truth deep down that only God and yourself can see.

He must update the 'weights' (AI speak) of your spirit to make it easier to walk in faith.
But the word 'weights' means 2 things:
- https://deepai.org/machine-learning-glossary-and-terms/weight-artificial-neural-network
- And it is a weight that holds down your spirit.

Initially, it takes great effort lift your own burdens for Him to get in. You do this by following his commandments.
Then His spirit inside of you helps to lift them; Keeps those weights where they belong.

If you think it depends on personal truth then you have some knots (unsolved expressions, complicated [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boolean_algebra#:~:text=In%20mathematics%20and%20mathematical%20logic,denoted%201%20and%200%2C%20respectively.][boolean algebra]]) in your spirit | Pure Imaginary   | Transcendental |

The only true truths that are part of the base-truth substrate are the Pure and Transcendental truths - That's you and God. Everything else is a fabricated fiction, or elaborate dream - the world that's been pulled over your eyes.

Unconditional love is a personal truth. It's not reliant on another.
But where is the door to let Jesus in to heal and hold those stigmas?
The door is opened when you hear God's commandments and obey, and identify the stigmas as lies and drop them, you open the door to Jesus the Holy Spirit comes in -- this is a part of Jesus/God.
The door is opened to the Holy Spirit to come inside which is the entrance to your personal truth, to allow Jesus to come inside and reside.
The Holy Spirit is Jesus' spirit broken and distributed.
This is how it happened for me.

When we say invite Jesus into your heart. This is what it means, I think.
The words you heard when you were young,
"Invite Jesus into your heart" is only understood after obeying God's commandments.
But bear so much resemblance to how you would come to understand it personally, they are =provenance= that when you finally actually
understand what it means, it gives you assurance.

Like releasing the 'weights', a typology from AI terminology to the burdens on your soul. That just gives me the CHILLS!

Impurity is dependency on external sources of truth and devoid of sound base.

+ According to Science, God Does Not Exist :: https://www.learnreligions.com/science-allows-belief-god-does-not-exist-248234

+ =Luke 4:12= :: Jesus answered, “It is said: ‘Do not put the Lord your God to the test.’”

God actually avoids being tested, which means
that you can't use empirical science for this,
because that requires taking such measurements
of God. He prerequisites that you must come to
a personal truth about Him in a different way. *There is no avoiding it*.

*** Pragmatic Truth
If you hear something like: "X demographic
cannot be saved. I am right, I have read and
studied the New Testament." that person is
probably a false teacher. It's easy to
recognise when you think of it in terms of
which types of truth are impure. When someone
says that they are right, they assert truth to
be from the desecration zone of truth types.

#+BEGIN_SRC text -n :async :results verbatim code
  Pragmatic theories of truth have the effect of
  shifting attention away from what makes a
  statement true and toward what people mean or
  do in describing a statement as true.
#+END_SRC

Jesus continually reinforces Personal Truth of Him as
the means, and Him as being the Way. Rejection
of Jesus Christ as the True Messiah is a red
flag. Keep sight of absolute truth. We will
all be affected soon by virtual reality. You
must acknowledge your base reality, and God's
part in it.
If you see it, you know with certainty
that that person is a Liar, from the Father of
Lies. That does not mean they cannot be saved. They can, but you must help them to see the light.

** What is Heaven? (the afterlife if in God, rather)
This is my imagination at work... I hope it's true.

If we are in God, then when you die and the
truth substrate is reset, all the lies are
forgotten and the other truth types become
incorruptible derivations of absolute truth again.

Then we learn about real truth (God) and
everyone in Him, and use the other truth types
to praise Him. All the other forms of
communication now are impossible to form
mistruth with! That's nuts! That means every
time you speak it creates things in real life!
And everything you create, being a perfect
expression of God, worships God!

So we run around with God as he proudly wears us on his Tapestry of
Truth, creating whatever we can imagine along with Him and we can never make a mistake while we do it!
Every word spoken simultaneously worships God and creates to our heart's desire...

The reason this is the case is that communication in Heaven is a projection of base truth, just like soul was for us on Earth.

=Matthew 24:35=

#+BEGIN_SRC text -n :async :results verbatim code
  Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will never pass away.
#+END_SRC

Even Heaven now is corrupted but God is not.

What we think of =Heaven= (i.e. the place we
go when we die, if we are in God), is not what
Heaven is now. Even Heaven as a current place is
corrupted.

** What are lies?
If you think about it, in all those types of
truth listed above aside from personal truth,
they all are the essence of what accusations are made of.

Lies are the accusations you believe -- they infiltrate personal truth.

Imagine every type of truth save for personal truth used as a slander.
Imagine in Hell, everyone saying so eloquently "We all came to the conclusion that you are a monster X because A,B,C,D -- all the things you did in your life which you remember and they tell you you still are, whilst in your heart you wish none of it was so, and are left feeling like you deserve this."
You were tricked into denying personal truth all your life, so you failed to let Jesus in to remove the weights, now this is what it is like for the rest of eternity.
Hell is composed of lies. Lies are not false in any of these truth senses -- that's what makes them sting.
But because you don't have the alethiometer of absolute truth you now swim in a lake of it.
But if you had identity in Christ they wouldn't mean anything.

I know for a fact that anyone could accuse me
of not being a Christian for a million reasons.
But based on trust in this personal truth I
have, in my personal truth I know that I
am in Christ and hope that I don't forget it.

** What is soul?
Soul in the philosophical sense is everything else aside
from spirit -- It is what is able to be duplicated in the form of an AI. And that is arriving today.

My perspective on soul is that it is our mind, body, imagination and spiritual/astral body in this reality.
Our [[https://mullikine.github.io/posts/hierarchy-of-souls/][soul]] will die but spirit cannot be destroyed because it is made of the stuff of absolute truth, which I'll call spiritual truth, even the truth of corruption of spiritual truth.
However, soul can be reconstructed from spirit. So we are given and experience a new soul. Essentially, we are remade from the ground-up on perfect truth.

# ** The nature of death
# We are already in the process of dying. The
# time in our decent which we cling to the rope
# is different for all. The sacrifice God made
# reaches through all stages of the mortal life
# including death because it was a spiritual
# sacrifice. He can be found in all modes of
# consciousness.

** Terminology
Spirit, soul and hologram are defined here in *my* own way.

+ spirit :: I have defined spirit as the bedrock of personal truth, and soul as the emanation or hologram of that.

+ soul :: Body + Mind + Astral. Everything emanated from spirit. May also be defined as a separate construct from body.

+ body :: The physical part of soul.

+ hologram [of soul] :: Emanation of experience through spirit. The unique light of God's light being refracted through your spirit (personal truth).

As of <2022-04-26 Tue>, 7 days after writing this article, I have discovered the Kabbalah and are reading about it.

Fascinatingly, there are so many overlapping ideas.
Soul, however is defined a little differently in the Kabbalah.

I recommend finding your personal truth first
and then using it to read other documents such
as Kabbalah, rather than attempting it the
other way around.

The reason is that if you have a conception of
who is God then He continues to be your
ground-truth, which you can use to compare to
what you read. This is the alethiometer of
truth I am talking about for helping you to
navigate while reading.

** In conclusion!
1. You can't become perfect truth by lying to yourself! You must understand your personal truth, and invite Jesus into it.
2. You can't make that personal truth into perfect truth without understanding who you are making it for! Jesus isn't just a name.
3. You can't know who you are making it for without learning who God is behind the name; You need to understand and obey his commandments in accordance with your personal truth! Not in accordance with consensus truth, or pragmatic truth, or constructivist truth, or coherence truth, or even pragmatic truth. In other words; Not by works, not by learning the right words or speaking them right, not by the virtue of human consensus.
4. You can't understand his commandments without following them! You can't lie to yourself while doing this. You have to follow them to the core of your personal truth. It's different for different people. When you follow them, it must be in accordance with your personal truth.
5. Then it will all click!

You realise that your identity matrix with the
added columns now in theory can make your
entire personal truth validated by math. This is known to be true personally.
On judgement, the identity matrix is validated. It equates to true!

I believe God can save and catch a person's soul and spirit even after they have died, and a person in spirit may come to know Jesus.
Consider when Jesus raises a dead girl. Jesus absolutely may catch a person's fall.
He went there Himself. This is what I believe. I pray for those that met their end without coming to know their true identity while awake in this life.

+ =Psalm 139:8= :: If I go up to the heavens, you are there; if I make my bed in the depths, you are there.

Jesus is the Way and the Truth (that you needed) and the Life (that you *actually* want), substantially!

Because it's not scientific as I described in
the opening paragraph, and is based on
personal truth, all it takes to find acquire
identity is a type of belief - literally!
Belief based on the one type of truth you will never
see posted *anywhere* as being objective
truth. Everything out there tries to evade the
validity of your personal truth.

Jesus doesn't want us to do this. The hidden danger of seeking truth outside of the Christian paradigm is you may engage in activities that are dangerous spiritually.

=Authentic self= and =integrity= are key to find your personal truth compass.
These people have certainly found it.

They do attack fundamentalist Christianity a bit in that first 2 minutes; Specifically, teachings about the rapture, the second coming, Hell, etc.

What these people are talking about is one of the important parts of Christianity, particularly of having a spiritual awakening.
I think becoming born-again is a spiritual awakening but in God.

There is a call to action though, which was not talked about in this video, in the form of Jesus' commandments.

The teachings of the second coming, rapture, Hell, etc. are all secondary to this most important topic of becoming born-again and following Jesus.

I think it might be possible to have an experience similar to being born-again spiritually but not of God.

One thing in particular which I disagree with is that people are already in Hell.

Our current reality I think is more like a mixture of Heaven and Hell, where people still believing in lies and having a corrupted identity are in pain already, and our afterlife will look a lot like a clearer depiction of our spiritual identity.

Hell-fire itself may be a mercy. Who knows.

*** Joy
=John 15:10–11=

  “If you keep my commandments, you will abide
  in my love. . . . These things I have spoken
  to you, that my joy may be in you, and that
  your joy may be full.”

I think there is a certain anhedonia particularly for the empty
pleasures of the world after discovering your personal identity.

Joy is sustained by keeping your eyes on Christ, and following Him in spirit, and through action, and being a torch of light for others to observe.

From now on joy is lost when we take our eyes off Christ and walk in error and contradiction of identity.
This is definitely my experience.

** The Outfit - Opening monologue
#+BEGIN_SRC text -n :async :results verbatim code
  To the naked eye a suit appears to consist of two parts; A jacket and trousers.
  But those two seemingly solid parts are composed of four different fabrics; Cotton, silk, rohrer and wool.
  And those four fabrics are cut into thirty-eight separate pieces.
  The process of size and form conjoining those pieces, requires no fewer than two-hundred and twenty-eight steps.
  So the first step is measurement.
  But measurement doesn't mean just reaching for your tape; So many inches there, so many inches there; No, no no.
  You cannot make something good until you understand who you're making it for.
  All clothing says something. I've had gentlemen walk into my shop and boast, "Oh I don't care about what I wear."
  And assuming that's true, doesn't that say something too?
  So who is your customer and what are you trying to say about him?
  The man walks through your door; What about him can you observe?
  Is he timid? Hunched over like mid-day clock? Or does he stand with confidence, spine at six and twelve?
  Is this a man of springtime pastel, clamouring to be noticed?
  Or is this a man of grey and brown, blending into the hurried crowd?
  Is this a man comfortable in his station?
  Or does he pine for grander things?
  And who would this man like to be?
  And who is he underneath?
  Take your measure, and when you understand who he is, then you're ready to begin.

After watching this movie later after finishing this article, I found more and more parallels between the movie and what I was writing.
We have to come to know who God is, so we can make ourselves into what is good, something fitting for God.

Also, everyone is lying to each other in this movie! How relevant that it be a movie about deception and uncovering the truth.

I will seek to improve this document as my understanding becomes clearer, for teaching purposes.

  1 Dear friends, do not believe every spirit,
  but test the spirits to see whether they are
  from God, because many false prophets have
  gone out into the world. 2 This is how you can
  recognize the Spirit of God: Every spirit that
  acknowledges that Jesus Christ has come in the
  flesh is from God, 3 but every spirit that does
  not acknowledge Jesus is not from God. This is
  the spirit of the antichrist, which you have
  heard is coming and even now is already in the
  world.

  4 You, dear children, are from God and have
  overcome them, because the one who is in you
  is greater than the one who is in the world.
  5 They are from the world and therefore speak
  from the viewpoint of the world, and the world
  listens to them. 6 We are from God, and whoever
  knows God listens to us; but whoever is not
  from God does not listen to us. This is how we
  recognize the Spirit a of truth and the spirit
  of falsehood.
