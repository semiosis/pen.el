* Mount Hermon
Deut. 3:9). In the apocryphal Book of Enoch, Mount Hermon is the place where the Watcher class of fallen angels descended to Earth. They swear upon the mountain that they would take wives among the daughters of men and take mutual imprecation for their sin (Enoch 6).

https://www.gotquestions.org/mount-Hermon.html

Mount Hermon (or “sacred mountain”) is the highest mountain in ancient Israel, boasting majestic, snowcapped peaks rising just over 9,000 feet above the sea. Mount Hermon may have been the site of Jesus Christ’s transfiguration.

This is a simple commandment from Jesus:
- Be perfect

He said =love your enemies=.
You must fulfil Jesus' commandments.

Grace begins when human ability ends.
When we have come to the end of the best we can do, we have come to the beginning of God's grace.

Being 'perfect' is dealing rightly with =everybody=.
It's summed up in the one word =love=.
Perfection and love cannot be separated.

Psalm 30:5

Grace sustains us

* Jesus
https://bibleproject.com/podcast/firstborn-creation/

Jesus is not in the image of God, he is the
image of God. In other words, when Paul reads
Genesis 1, he sees the pre-incarnate Jesus as
being the image in which humans are made.

Since Paul in the same breath calls Jesus the
"firstborn of creation" and the Creator of all
things, he definitely doesn't have in view
that Jesus is some kind of creature or created
being. Rather, "firstborn" in this case refers
to a status or identity: Jesus is the only Son
of the Father and, simultaneously, one with
the Father.

Humans were always meant to be united to the
love of God, and now through the sacrifice of
Jesus we can be truly united to God. That
means we can truly bear God's image--and truly
be human--in a way we couldn't without
redemption through Jesus.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feast_of_the_Cross
3 May (Holy Rood Day),

 May
The General Roman Calendar before 1960 contained the Feast of the Finding of
the Holy Cross (Roodmas) on 3 May. It commemorated the founding of the True
Cross by Saint Helena, the mother of the emperor Constantine.[18] With the
reorganisation of the liturgical calendar by his Motu proprio Rubricarum
instructum of Pope John XXIII (1960), the Feast of the Finding of the Cross was
celebrated only in some regions. Meanwhile, the finding of the True cross is
also commemorated at the Feast of the Exaltation of the Cross on 14 September.

* Being baptised into a name means to become the posession of another
The ASV (American Standard Version, 1901) reading in Matthew 28:19 is, “Go ye
therefore, and make disciples of all the nations, baptizing them into the name
of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.” Notice the wording “into
the name of.” What does that literally mean? The Greek words of this phrase
“into the name of” (“είς το όνομα”) mean to become the possession of another,
or to come under the protection of another. So, Great Commission baptism
results in one becoming the possession of the Spirit, Son, and Father.

  2 Wash me thoroughly from my iniquity, And
  cleanse me from my sin.

  3 For I acknowledge my transgressions, And my

  4 Against You, You only, have I sinned, And
  done this evil in Your sight— That You may be
  found just when You speak, And blameless when
  You judge.

  5 Behold, I was brought forth in iniquity, And
  in sin my mother conceived me.

  6 Behold, You desire truth in the inward
  parts, And in the hidden part You will make me
  to know wisdom.

  7 Purge me with hyssop, and I shall be clean;
  Wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow.

  8 Make me hear joy and gladness, That the
  bones You have broken may rejoice.

  9 Hide Your face from my sins, And blot out
  all my iniquities.

  10 Create in me a clean heart, O God, And
  renew a steadfast spirit within me.

  11 Do not cast me away from Your presence, And
  do not take Your Holy Spirit from me.

  12 Restore to me the joy of Your salvation,
  And uphold me by Your generous Spirit.

  13 Then I will teach transgressors Your ways,
  And sinners shall be converted to You.

  14 Deliver me from the guilt of bloodshed, O

  shall sing aloud of Your righteousness.

  15 O Lord, open my lips, And my mouth shall
  show forth Your praise.

  16 For You do not desire sacrifice, or else I
  would give it; You do not delight in burnt

For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God. No man is righteous of their own, we are all
guilty of sin and rebelled against Holy God who hates iniquity and demands justice. We all
deserve punishment for our sin, but God so loved the world that he sent his son Jesus Christ to
suffer and die on the cross on our behalf. Jesus never sinned and lived a perfect life of
obedience. He was crucified for our sins and for the sins of the whole world. 3 days after his
sacrifice, God raised Jesus Christ from the dead. He has resurrected to glory and lives forever
more. The Lord Jesus Christ has been given all power and authority. He sent out his followers to go
and make disciples of all nations, to proclaim the good news and to teach others to obey
everything he commanded them. He is now exalted and sits at the right of hand of God. God has
appointed a day to righteously judge the whole world by Jesus Christ who'm he has ordained. We
are called to preach the gospel and to warn all of mankind to repent and be baptized in the name of
Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, that you may receive the Holy Ghost. By grace and through
faith we are justified and reconciled back to God. Grace is not an excuse to continue in sin, but
through faith, God has given us the power to be dead to sin. The righteousness of every man is filthy
as rags, so that no man can boast. Blessed is the man who forsakes his sin and puts trust in the Lord
Jesus Christ. Cursed is the man who forsakes the faith and puts trust in his own good works. If we
say we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us. If we confess our sins, He is
faithful and just to forgive our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness. We encourage
everyone not to sin, and if any man does sin, we have an advocate with our father. He is jesus christ,
the righteous one! He is the propitiation of our sins, and not only for ours, but also for the sins of
the whole world. Those who reject the Lord Jesus Christ and the message of his mercy, will be
rejected on the great day of judgement.

  "God is truth. The way to truth lies through ahimsa (nonviolence)" – Sabarmati, 13 March 1927
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_SRC text -n :async :results verbatim code
  Gandhi summarised his beliefs first when he
  said "God is Truth".

  He would later change this statement to "Truth
  is God".

  Thus, satya (truth) in Gandhi's philosophy is
  "God".

  Gandhi, states Richards, described the term
  "God" not as a separate power, but as the
  Being (Brahman, Atman) of the Advaita Vedanta
  tradition, a nondual universal that pervades
  in all things, in each person and all life.

  According to Nicholas Gier, this to Gandhi
  meant the unity of God and humans, that all
  beings have the same one soul and therefore
  equality, that atman exists and is same as
  everything in the universe, ahimsa (non-
  violence) is the very nature of this atman.

* The Hare Krsna people
+ Matthew 21:43 :: Therefore say I unto you, The kingdom of God shall be taken from you, and given to a nation bringing forth the fruits thereof.

* Concepts in Christianity
** Kingdom of God
You may think of it like this. This is how I so-far believe it works. Some
people in this world are kings who are sorting the sheep from the goats.
Ultimately, they report to Jesus. Some beggars are actually kings in the
Kingdom of God, but in disguise. And when you serve them and insist for nothing
in return, they may insist they repay you, and then you may ask them to pray on
your behalf. And when people who serve others one day happen to serve a
disciple of Jesus, they get an eternal reward. The servants will be exalted.
The prideful will be humbled. It's an invisible kingdom spread out over the
Earth. When we pray for God's Kingdom to come to Earth, we are asking for help
in extending his Kingdom. In a kingdom there is governance. And at the top of
that Governance is Jesus Christ, King of Kings.

** Is Jesus God or the son of God?
This is how I believe it works. Jesus may be considered to be God in the same
way that if you saw God's right hand, you would say that it is God. God put
Himself into a human form to fulfil His own law to save us. - If you want to do
something properly, you have to do it yourself.

* Dreams - 09.01.23
** In an airport
- I think I was with Tom cruise
- I placed my and on someone's leg while in the waiting room of the airport
- I felt rested
- I kept doing that even while I knew it was Melee
- I then removed it and was ashamed of myself because it wasn't Melee

*** Prev day activities: This mirrors my conversation with Prashant
Where he showed me

** I was in Vanuatu
- I saw myself looking at Melee's facebook
  - I realised that I was able to scan over her facebook / read it in the spirit

** Prashant
- He is from the higher realm of my Father

* Talking to a police officer
** I saw a picture of the next hearing.
It looked like the requirements for me to stop blogging were removed.

** Police officer couldn't touch me
I wanted to write to them but I couldn't because when I got close to their
office, the magnet was moving my pen, making it hard to write.

** I sat inside the circle.
I could make myself and the pen so they can see it, but they can't take it from me.
I just sat inside the circle.
A person was sitting outside their place in the circle.
I was able to communicate to the police officer by writing on paper.

* Roads
** Narrow
https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%207&version=NASB

** Straight
https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+7&version=KJV

+ Isaiah 40:3 :: The voice of him that crieth in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of the LORD, make straight in the desert a highway for our God.

Paul helps us understand when he recounts how Jesus took on our sin and gave us
His righteousness (2 Corinthians 5:21) so that we could be reconciled to God (2
Corinthians 5:20).

Paul adds that it is not by works that we are saved, but rather by God’s grace
through the vehicle of belief in Jesus Christ (Ephesians 2:8–9).

If the broad gate that leads to destruction instead led to life, then we would
be able to boast that our works got us into heaven.

We would get the glory rather than God.

** My righteousness comes through Jesus.

+ [[https://biblehub.com/nasb_/john/3.htm][John 3:16-21]] :: “For God so loved the world, that He gave His only Son, so that everyone who believes in Him will not perish, but have eternal life. For God did not send the Son into the world to judge the world, but so that the world might be saved through Him. The one who believes in Him is not judged; the one who does not believe has been judged already, because he has not believed in the name of the only Son of God. And this is the judgment, that the Light has come into the world, and people loved the darkness rather than the Light; for their deeds were evil. For everyone who does evil hates the Light, and does not come to the Light, so that his deeds will not be exposed. But the one who practices the truth comes to the Light, so that his deeds will be revealed as having been performed in God.”

Religion is a vehicle for personal applied science. Science as most people
understand it is empirical science, but that's not a complete understanding
of science. The scientific method may also be used for personal science, and
that includes praying and asking God for his daily instruction, receiving a
dream, then acting on it the next day.

Relationship with God is personal science. It's scientific, just not empirical science.

You don't need a science degree for a relationship. To an atheist thinking
religion needs to be scientifically rigorous, I say this:

Relationship with God is personal science. It's scientific, just not empirical science. Religion needs to scientifically rigorous just about as much as a relationship coach needs to be scientifically rigorous. But we don't *need* a relationship coach to have a relationship. You just have one.

Can dreams be relied upon? Can feelings be relied upon? Can human reason be
relied upon?  The answer is God uses everything that you give Him, but none of
the modes of transmission are God Himself.

is to receive dreams from God or via His angels and not from spirit
guides, and the key to that.

Shane Mulligan
@The American Patriot  Absolutely. If you see the Gospel of Mary, it talks
about where a vision comes in. In the bible angels are the ones to deliver
visions to people. They can deliver it to the mind (especially while
sleeping). By the way, this happens to me all the time.
https://mullikine.github.io/posts/dream-resume/   I was born-again this year
and every night before I go to bed I ask God to speak to me (Our Father in
Heaven... give us our daily bread, which is His instruction). But in an
emergency, absolutely while awake God can speak to a person through their mind
or the heart - without a doubt. We're supposed to use our imagination and
feelings for God. That doesn't mean becoming people who don't have feelings.
No, we're created to have feelings. Some people are more feelings-oriented,
and others are logic-oriented. But God calls us to love Him with all our mind
AND heart AND body. Also in Exodus it talks about how God hardened Pharaoh's
heart etc. God certainly gives us our feelings, and puts things in a person's
heart too. Critical thinking and critical feeling are both good things. We
should trust in God and His word, but the word lives inside us (Gospel of
John). The apostles and prophets did a great job and transcribing visions and
revelations, but the point is that they came from visions and revelations -
that's the living word. The issue with disregarding critical thinking and
critical feeling is that it makes us into robots/drones. Now I go to sleep, I
pray for God's instruction and He gives me dreams every night about people in
my life. Then in the day I think critically and feel critically about them and
I act on it. For example, using my feelings of guilt for ghosting someone this
year, God gave me a couple of dreams to remind me of him, and now I am going
to ask him for forgiveness. This is how God can even use a person's guilt,
which is a feeling. Don't disregard feelings, love God with your feelings.

insults and distress, and partly by becoming companions with those who were so
treated.

For you showed sympathy to the prisoners and accepted joyfully the seizure of
your property, knowing that you have for yourselves a better and lasting
possession.

Therefore, do not throw away your confidence, which has a great reward.

For you have need of endurance, so that when you have done the will of God, you
may receive what was promised.

* 16.12.22 Mountain rocks with Dad
I was near the top of a mountain with Dad and one other person.
We were standing on a boulder - the three of us but our collective weight was
too much for the boulder and it was about to give way.

I had to step off their boulder so I started reaching upwards for more boulders on the mountainside.
A few of them were slipping as I lay ahold of them.
I reached higher and grabbed the topmost rock.
It was jagged, forming the top of the mountain ridge, but it was strong and
easy to lay ahold of, and did not budge.

I grabbed it.

I then woke up.

* 17.12.22 Renouncing pride and sorcery
Dream this morning.

** High plateau helicopter
I was on a high plateau of a beautiful green forest mountain.

The mountain had levels of plateaus.
I seemed to be at the top.

With a small helicopter, I was flying above my high plateau, and looking down there were some beautiful sights to be seen.
I was awestuck at how beautiful it was.

*** I went to a lower plateau where my mum was situated.
I went down to the lower plateau to see my mum.
I asked her to come up and see what I had seen.
There was a building on the lower plateau which we walked though.
It was a bit like a mechanic's workshop.
Outside were a bunch of wrecked cars.
I left the building to walk though the car graveyard.
Mum was following me, looking for a way to follow me through the wrecked cars.

I found what looked to be my mini helicopter. It looked powerful enough to get one person up above the high plateau and see the view.
I was frustrated that I couldn't take my mum up with me at the same time.

Mum had a much smaller and humbler helicopter, but I remember thinking it wouldn't be able to reach the same heights.
Soon after, I ended up going up by myself again.
I climbed up high but the helicopter began to run out of power and the propellors were slowing right down, and I was frightened.

I was contemplating if I would have enough power to turn off the motor and
start it again before reaching the bottom but I realised I wouldn't get any lift.
It was a perilously far way to fall.

I then woke up.

** On the beach
*** I levitated across the beach past many people with my neck down and cloak over my head
People said, "Is that a ghost / sorcerer?"
They couldn't see my face.

*** I commanded a handkercheif to dance in the wind with my thought, making shapes as it flew past people on the beach
I think I may have had some pride in me too because I was doing it to amaze people, and I enjoyed doing that.

*** I reached the end of the beach
There was a little shelter.
Inside was a young guy with a white eternity rose playing cards with some others.
My youngest brother Callum appeared.
He said, "Hi brother, smiling."

But I remembered the dream I had several days ago about pride. "It was pride," my older brother said.
"In my youngest brother?" I reponded. "Yup," my older brother confirmed. And that I what was responsible for his fall.

It's for that reason that I believe the mountains in dreams represent the heights and the
beach represents the bottom near the sea.

It makes me sad to see the white eternity rose on a person here.
I think it costs a lot.

*** Creating a window that is not made of glass but obscured so that I can hide from my youngest brother

I went behind a door frame within the house and commanded my stack of white napkins to cover the
face of the door frame.

Then I exited by leaving the building through the back wall like a ghost, backing into the wall.

Then, standing outside the building, my brother inside, I avoided being seen.

*** Outside, I though to myself
I could turn myself into many gold bricks or white paper napkins.

  Mark8:37 Or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul?

*** My interpretation
I believe that this is certainly about pride and selling one's own soul for
what you want.

You see, one's own soul is worth so much to God.
You are worth more than many sparrows.
What would I give for what I want?

I don't want to sell my own soul.
Renouncing soul-ties.

The white napkins might represent something like a magic trick which people
can't see through.

The gold bars I think represents the price of a soul.

I choose to do neither.

  36 So Gideon said to God, “If You will save Israel by my hand as You have said—
  37 look, I shall put a fleece of wool on the threshing floor; if there is dew
  on the fleece only, and it is dry on all the ground, then I shall know that You
  will save Israel by my hand, as You have said.” 38 And it was so. When he rose
  early the next morning and squeezed the fleece together, he wrung the dew out
  of the fleece, a bowlful of water. 39 Then Gideon said to God, “Do not be angry
  with me, but let me speak just once more: Let me test, I pray, just once more
  with the fleece; let it now be dry only on the fleece, but on all the ground
  let there be dew.” 40 And God did so that night. It was dry on the fleece only,
  but there was dew on all the ground.

I haven't gotten onto Enoch yet :D but I'm glad theres some good material later down the line. I'm just going to focus as much as I can on the Era of Jesus and his disciples, the acts and epistles for the moment - i'm new. i never really had any interest in reading the bible up until april this year
When God literally, kid you not, revealed Himself to me :D
I was honestly in such bad shape. I cried out soooo hard for God
noone will employ me, i received so much persecution. i asked someone to marry me this year, her family took me to court. etc. etc. i couldnt handle it so i took up vaping
i was spending all my money on take out, and my parents are dirt broke. heaps of pornography and vaping etc. to ease my pain. but what i did was i then decided, im going to do my best to follow the 10 commandments to the best of my ability and start giving my money away
because I genuinely needed God's rescue. and as i did that, i was persecuted
persecuted, i was called a litany of different horrible names for doing such innocent things as trying to give a girl flowers or ask a different girl out, or for trying to get an appropriate job, and not be manipulated. well, i got persecuted so hard for doing such things as telling the truth and sharing love
and i was following the 10 commandments to my best ability, and from the heart
the girl i love too, her family wouldnt let me talk to her. theres a backstory to it
well you wont believe this
8 April the Holy Spirit descends on me and i join with Christ, and i am thinking - what is going on??? i will just pray to God the Father Son and Holy Spirit and consecrate this part of my life
then easter sunday. the pastor of my church reaches out to me randomly - hadn't done so in a year, just as i am writing this download to my brain, i just give it to him
tapestry of truth article i wrote.
and the meeting with the Holy Spirit
it happened on the girl i loves birthday
married in the bridal chamber, on her birthday
my second birthday is her first birthday
as in, my born-again day

For the Son of Man did not baptize any of his disciples. But [...], if those

But the baptism of truth is something else; it is by renunciation of the world

renouncing it are lying, and they are coming to the place of fear.

** Exclamation mark
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/993112/what-does-the-exclamation-mark-mean-in-a-haskell-declaration

I believe it is a strictness annotation.

Haskell is a pure and lazy functional
language, but sometimes the overhead of
lazyness can be too much or wasteful. So to
deal with that, you can ask to compiler to
fully evaluate the arguments to a function
instead of parsing thunks around.

If you ever wonder again if the current year is a leap year, a good way of
checking is to divide the last two digits by 4 and if the quotient is a whole
number, then it's a leap year. For example, for 2022 you would divide 22 by 4
which provides the quotient of 5.5, which is not a whole number.

* Planonism
Plato's theory of soul, which was inspired by the teachings of Socrates,
considered the psyche (ψυχή) to be the essence of a person, being that which
decides how people behave. Plato considered this essence to be an incorporeal,
eternal occupant of a person's being. Plato said that even after death, the
soul exists and is able to think. He believed that as bodies die, the soul is
continually reborn (metempsychosis) in subsequent bodies. Plato divided the
soul into three parts: the logistikon (reason), the thymoeides (spirit), and
the epithymetikon (appetite).

* Valentian
In the beginning were Darkness, Chaos, and Water (skotos, kai bythos, kai
hydōr), but the Spirit indwelling in the midst of them, divided them one
from another. From the intermingling of Darkness with Spirit proceeds the
mētra which again is kindled with fresh desire after the Spirit; she gives
birth first to four, and then to other four aeons, and so produces a right
and a left, light and darkness. Last of all comes forth an aischros aiōn,
who has intercourse with the mētra, the offspring whereof are Gods, Angels,
Daemons, and Spirits.

Christ was not originally a name but a title derived from the Greek word

the anointed son of King David, whom some Jews expected to restore the fortunes
of Israel.

Take hold of the eternal life to which you
were called and about which you made the good
confession in the presence of many witnesses.

13 charge you in the presence of God, who
gives life to all things, and of Christ Jesus,
who in his testimony before 4 Pontius Pilate
made the good confession, 14 to keep the
commandment unstained and free from reproach
until the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ,
15 which he will display at the proper
time—he who is the blessed and only
Sovereign, the King of kings and Lord of
lords, 16 who alone has immortality, who
dwells in unapproachable light, whom no one
has ever seen or can see.

To him be honor and eternal dominion.

17 As for the rich in this present age,
charge them bnot to be haughty, nor to set
their hopes on dthe uncertainty of riches, but
on God, who richly provides us with
everything to enjoy.

18 They are to do good, to be rich in good
works, to be generous and gready to share, 19
thus storing up treasure for themselves as a
good foundation for the future, so that they
may take hold of that which is truly life.

20 O Timothy, guard the deposit entrusted to
you.

Avoid the irreverent babble and
contradictions of what is falsely called
“knowledge,” 21 for by professing it some have
swerved from the faith.

  It is my mind, with its store of images, that gives the world color and sound;
  and that supremely real and rational certainty which I can “experience” is, in
  its most simple form, an exceedingly complicated structure of mental images.
  Thus there is, in a certain sense, nothing that is directly experienced except

“A truth is a truth, when it works.” Jung (1913)[6] “That is how we know the truth: the truth is that which helps us to live – to live properly.”
**
That which we most desire to find in our lives may be found in the places we
least want to explore.

Those places can be found in our external lives, in the malevolence of the
world we live in, or internally, in the shadowy depths of the unconscious.

**
Active imagination is a coscious method of experimentation and the exploration of the unconscious mind.
It employs creative imagination as an organ for "perceiving outside your own mental boxes - viewing the contests,
personalities, creatures and environments of your unconscious.

* We have to clean the spirit / heart first
Jesus said, “You blind Pharisee! First clean the inside of the cup and the

* We are not supposed to tempt God

“Trust in the LORD with all your heart, and do not lean on your own

I don't understand this.
Does it mean do not worry about anything?
How can a person 'trust' in God?
What is it trust for?

How do I trust in the LORD with all my heart?
What does that mean?
With regards to my heart (personal truth), what does that mean?
Does it mean, be a truthful person?

Is being a truthful person what it's basically all about?

* Turning away from truth but enduring only what they want to hear, and heap up teachers which teach such things

* Unconditional love is misrepresented
That’s brutal.

You’re stigmatizing people for their valid
personal truths by labelling them as stalkers
which is not objectively true; They’re
different things.

You’re tainting the definition of
unconditional/unrequited love by saying it
cant exist without disrespecting the so-called
‘stalkee’, when it does inherently exist in
isolation.

This type of affection, when pure, is
selfless, not violating.

In reality, some personal truths can’t be
dropped because they are part of self-
identity.

People should care about other people’s
unchangeable personal truths because everyone
has spots.

If it’s the truth of love for a fellow human
being, then that makes things complicated but
it’s not immoral, it’s not wrong, and
shouldn’t be demonized.

You can’t make this particular problem go away
by ignoring it, nor is it humane to do so.

In fact, by flat-out ignoring it you
needlessly exaccerbate the problem by making
the person feel like they have not been
represented fairly and such a person may fight
back against the injustice.

That’s when a harmless situation becomes a
problem, and when people get hurt.

There should be *some* allowance for allowing
people to express themself, to the point of
vindicating from misconstruing labels, at the
least.

Setting a completely prohibitive boundary is
not humane and is anti-social.

The result of allowing *some* communication is
entirely good and within the boundaries of
what is acceptable, fair and humane.

Labels, discrimination and stigmatization do
not accurately describe people.

Part of being a member of society should
involve respect for fellow human beings and
the freedom of expression.

For a person who is strongly convicted of such
love, it's like an unstoppable train meeting
an immovable object, but there is no such
thing as an invisible wall that will stop that
moving train, and they'd take the price of
continuing for that expression of truth - the
price that may be, social damage or a police
conviction.

But why selfishly elevate obstinance to that
stage when you can grant a little bit of
humanity instead?

Either it needs to be charged or you have turned it on/off, or the atomizer(the
tank) is not screwed in, or the tank is screwed in fine but the coil is not,
there are a few reason. The battery could be done, or like it just won’t hold a
charge anymore, depends on how old the device is, how many times you’ve charged
it, etc. Also though internal battery type mods really just don’t last very
long if it is the only thing you vape on day in and day out for a few months,
the battery, like any rechargeable battery, just will not keep charging
forever.

I had traffic lights.
This means bad connection?

** This had happened and therefore my vape currently *does* need to be charged
If the LED blinks 15 times when you press the fire button, the device’s battery
is dead. Charge the SMOK Vape Pen V2 fully and then attempt to vape again.

** Before cleaning atomizer, I was getting traffic light blinking
Now it's black while plugged in. What does that mean?
Possibly it means I used the laptop charger and no current.
Maybe I can get current again after waiting a while.

* Covid stats
- Evidence suggests that the proportion of asymptomatic infections is much higher for Omicron, perhaps as high as 80–90%,
- Although most people with COVID-19 experience mild symptoms or moderate
  illness, approximately 10-15% of cases progress to severe disease, and about
  5% become critically ill.
- 5% of 30-39 year olds get hospitalised.
  - This is 10-15% of Delta's hospitalisation rate -- which is a lot lower.
- 10% of the 5% hospitalised make it to ICU.
- 1 in 10 with acute illness get long covid
- Many people with acute illness are not hospitalised.
  - Therefore, I can assume around 1/10 people generally get long covid
- Vaccination probably doesn't prevent chance of long covid
- Everyone must switch to natural immunity (catch covid) eventually because extra vaccinations have diminishing results

- heightened sensory perception

- no laughter,
- altered perception of time and space

- my mind ambitiously trying to do more than what is normally required of it, and me wishing that i could remain in that altered state
  - the state where i perceive so much, but it feels like with attention to the detail, i lose attention to the long-term
  - if only i had the capability to have attention at boths resolutions simultaneously
- able to observe myself thinking about thinking like I have a thought loop around my thought loop
- not really an increased appetite but just the desire of the comfort of it

  xs).] The map function is polymorphic and its type indicates clearly that
  its first argument is a function; note also that the two a's must be
  instantiated with the same type (likewise for the b's). As an example of the
  use of map, we can increment the elements in a list:

* Inka's conversation with John Dee
#+BEGIN_SRC text -n :async :results verbatim code
  John Dee was an English mathematician, astronomer, astrologer, teacher, occultist, and alchemist. He was the court astronomer for, and advisor to, Elizabeth \
  I, and spent much of his time on alchemy, divination and Hermetic philosophy. As an antiquarian, he had one of the largest libraries in England at the time.

  Inka is a colourful, fun-loving girl who is travelling New Zealand.

  This is a conversation between Inka and John Dee.

  John Dee speaks using magical words and a language only magicians of ancient times can comprehend.

  - Inka: Can I break the silence?
  - John Dee: Yes, Inka, you may. I was just talking about the wonderful journey we are about to embark on.
  - Inka: Tell me about this journey.
  - John Dee: We are going to travel through time. We will be going to the future, Inka.
  - Inka: I was wondering if you have any advice for me.
  - John Dee: Of course, Inka. I have a wealth of advice for you. I have been a traveller for ages, and I have learned a lot about life. You may want to go to the library and read my book, it is called The Diary of Inka.
  - Inka: What was the last story?
  - John Dee: It was about the time I was in Egypt. I was in a pyramid, and I was looking at the stars. In the stars, I could see the future. I could see you, Inka. I could see you in the future.
  - Inka: I really liked driving around in the convertible with Jonty, and dancing at the beach. What does that mean?
  - John Dee: It means you will be happy, Inka. You will dance and sing and be full of joy.
  - Inka: What were you working on just before I interrupted?
  - John Dee: I was working on expanding the time-line. I am working on a device that will allow us to travel back in time to before the split between the worlds.
  - Inka: What do you mean worlds? I thought there was only one.
  - John Dee: The worlds were not always split. There was once just one world, and there were people like you and me. Then, for some reason, the worlds split. Now there are two.
  - Inka: What led me New Zealand?
  - John Dee: I think the energy of that place draws people like you and me. The energy of it is so strong and pure that it can draw people like me through time and space to you. So you can go back to that moment in time, and be part of that energy. The name Inka means "light" in Maori. The name Inka means the colour green. It means you. It is a name that I have never heard before. The name Inka means the best in the world.
  - Inka: What should I write in my book?
  - John Dee: Write what you feel. You should write what you see.
  - John Dee: Write about the trees and the birds, and the flowers and the raindrops.
  - Inka: And the sun?
  - John Dee: Write about the sky and the sea.
  - Inka: And the clouds? And the stars?
  - John Dee: Write about the moon and the ocean.
  - Inka: And the mountains? And the rivers? And the rocks?
  - John Dee: Write about the earth.
  - Inka: And the water? And the animals? And the plants?
  - John Dee: Write about the forests and the fields.
  - Inka: And the wind? And the fire? And the fish? And the sand?
  - John Dee: Write about the deep ocean.
  - Inka: am i real?
  - John Dee: You are.
  - Inka: so i breathe and experience?
  - John Dee:
  - Inka: like a rain and the sun
  - John Dee:
  - Inka: so i breathe and experience?

Language, therefore, can no longer be considered a 'reflection' of the
physical reality but rather "by providing us with a conceptual map
with which to impose a certain order on what we see and experience,
the language we speak plays a significant role in shaping what
constitutes for us the reality of the material world." (Storey 118) In
structuralist hermeneutics, language is not merely a representational
tool but an active structure that organizes and shapes our very
existence.

The endless substitution of signifiers is however not an absolute
obliteration of older meanings. In a constant attempt to achieve clarity
of thought, we replace one signifier with another, placing the previous
one 'under erasure'.

** Erlang
Hi, Shane. I found erlang's pattern matching is very similar to haskell's.
It is feels like Haskell except the there is no type.
No type declaration I mean. And in erlang, they usually put a symbol(atom) as
part of their argument to indicate what is that mean.. feels like declare type
manually using symbol.

#+BEGIN_SRC erlang -n :async :results verbatim code
  -module(geometry).
  -export([area/1, test/0]).

  area({rectange, Width, Height}) ->
      Width * Height;

  area({square, Side}) -> Side * Side;

  area({circle, Radius}) ->
      3.1415926 * Radius * Radius.


  test() ->
      12 = area({rectange, 3, 4}),
      144 = area({square, 12}),
      tests_worked.
#+END_SRC

Like generic programming.
Its pattern matching is so similar with Haskell's .

Learning erlang is like doing lisp in an
traditional syntax... feels wired but very
fun. I guess it is because I have been
familiar with Lisp and exposed to Haskell
before.

It is like re-learning lisp in a way that in
C, or javascript syntax...

  The film begins with:
  Call trans opt: received 2-19-98 13:24:18 REC:Log>
  Trace program running
  (312) 555 0690
  The end transmission is specifically:
   Call trans opt: received 9-18-99 14:32:21 REC:Log>
   WARNING: carrier anomaly
   Trace program: running
  System Failure

  A date/number series pops up periodically in the film:
    9-18-99. This date/number series is, for example, used as
    the time Neo gets up for work (9:18 a.m.) and the date that
    appears at the end transmission. In a recent online chat,
    the Wachowski Bros. noted that the numbers (9-18) were
    actually Andy's wife's birthday. Roger has suggested it
    might represent 9-9-99 (9-(1+8)-99), the date to
    determine if certain systems are Y2K compatible.

* racket
** =cons= / =pair=
#+BEGIN_SRC text -n :async :results verbatim code
  The cons function actually accepts any two
  values, not just a list for the second
  argument. When the second argument is not
  empty and not itself produced by cons, the
  result prints in a special way. The two values
  joined with cons are printed between
  parentheses, but with a dot (i.e., a period
  surrounded by whitespace) in between:

    > (cons 1 2)
    '(1 . 2)
    > (cons "banana" "split")
    '("banana" . "split")

  Thus, a value produced by cons is not always
  a list. In general, the result of cons is a
  pair. The more traditional name for the cons?
  function is pair?, and we’ll use the
  traditional name from now on.
