/* We meet the Father - Jesus introduces us */
Then it's up to us to do the will of the Father

* I should be able to do my work now at the same time
If I can find enjoyment from my work then I would simultaneously avoid idleness and such sin.

* The Holy Spirit also restrains

* It's important to get up to speed again with the OpenAI stuff, for the moment
As a means of making a living.

** But nowhere near as important as remaining faithful to God
Perhaps I should take a step back.

- God = Holy Spirit
- God = God the Father
- God = God the Son (Jesus was a personage of God incarnated as human. Yes, true.)
  - We can partake in this.
    - Is Jesus God, one aspect of God, yes, because He was sinless.
  - I believe that Jesus is in the Father and the Father is in Jesus
    - But that can be true of us also.
  - If I can call my Father God, then I would say that's spiritual.
    - Therefore, spirit is already saved for me.
    - I must endeavour to be filled with the Spirit to have my light-soul also saved, and body saved.
      - https://mullikine.github.io/posts/the-secret-book-of-james/
  - Jesus then, too, would say God the Father is his father, and that's spiritual for certain
    - But for Jesus it's also soulful and physical - He is part of God the Father

* I trust in Jesus for the forgiveness of sin
I am in Christ's body and there is no more condemnation for me.
However, I put to death the works of the flesh.

* The Holy Spirit is God, for sure

* What is prosperity? Yeah, it's not about money. It's about the blessings of God
[[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hefnF8KNmF4][Come, Holy Spirit! - YouTube]]

** True wealth
Wealth = goodness and mercy

Dwell in the house of the Lord forever.

** True wealth is surely having the Holy Spirit inside me
It's living in power.
It's living in rest.
It's living in God's favour and provision.

*** Do not sin against the Holy Spirit
Do not favour the flesh over the Spirit - it's a bad deal.
Rather, make the flesh conform to the Spirit.

* Dreams
** Had a dream that there were many people in their KCC uniforms
Busses had arrived in New Zealand.
Chinese people.

I talked to them and they were friendly.

** Another dream where Sina was upset after I said I could make NLP functions for coersion and manipulation and said I cheated in the past
If I have a dream that it's bad for me to make the harmful NLP prompt functions
then I shouldn't make them.

I calmed him down.

** Had another dream where I asked for a sample from an ice-cream store
- french word for sample

* I should certainly be investing in lasting technology

* Can I do more with my mind for God?
I have to use it all for God.

* Joy vs Happiness
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCP2SGTIz28

Of course anyone can experience joy.

But what about the joy of the Lord?

* Perhaps I should do a lot more with regards to Pen.el

* It's possible that the light from my body lights the world
Truly. It's a little solipsistic.
Is it really all about sharing my own influence?
I highly doubt that.
It's about glorifying God.

* I must not allow Pen.el to slip away into obscurity

* It's my duty to seek to understand everything
And also frame it in terms of my past.

* The other thing I can do is properly learn Haskell or Ethereum before the end of the year
So I can be programming in it proficiently next year.

* First gnostics
https://theopolisinstitute.com/leithart_post/gnosticism-and-samarian-theology/

The first gnostics were Jews who adhered to their Bibles.

* Yes, it's very important to get very deep into philosophy, etc. But it would be better to be deep in AI+Spirituality
Do that because it's important to have a firm grasp of reality.

* Pen.el needs many different components
I need common lisp and many different applications.
It can't all be monolithic emacs.

* Inhabited by a nice ghost

* I want Melee

* Noone can serve 2 masters
OK, spirituality works just like that.
That's what's interesting.
I think possibly more was known about spiritually back in those times.

Things like:
- bridal chamber
- yoking to God
- yoking to any spirit for that matter
- 'becoming' a person

* It's really important that I continue to move forward
I should probably push forward until they persecute me in court.
It's the meaning of my life.
I should not deny Jesus.
I will not.
Just call the court a mickey mouse court.
Mention Jesus and persecution.

* One day I'm going to look back at the TV Series 'The Chosen' and be able to see its flaws, as I do and will my own
Keep that in mind; My relationship with God must be maintained.
I must not break faith with God.

** How would I have broken faith so far?
- Potentially, heresy
- Not distributing the bibles
- Not investing into Ethereum

* It's still very important to continue writing my thoughts down
I can inspire people, even if not everyone agrees with it.
Recognise that people will agree or disagree depending on their own outlook.

Certainly do not be one of those people who are afraid of voicing anything
which some person out there will disagree with.

I can have a perspective even if it doesn't reflect everyone's perspective.
I can have a perspective even if I know that not all people would have that perspective.

** For example:
- I believe/To me
 - We are given only one life
   - By halfway though:
     - we should know that living is a gift
       Agree or disagree

* It's still very important that I continue to remain in good standing with God
But I also need to support Melee.

* Don't get sucked into games through being depressed
Rather, I should increase what I am doing.
Be myself.

* This is the way I should be thinking -- moreso than merely reading ancient apocryphal scripture
** TODO Make a case for Spiritual Intelligence
- Without devoting myself to a higher calling, my intelligence would gain asymptotic dunamis
  - I would become too powerful from a rational and soulful perspective

Therefore, there must be more; the game must increase in difficulty.

i.e. I must be obligated to regulate myself morally through an authority higher than humans i.e. God's Spirit.

* What work is to be done in the Spirit?
I must be in the Spirit to know it.
To hear from God.

* In order to mature in my faith / spirituality, I need to really embrace Jesus more and more
I need to embrace the concepts:
- Holy Spirit
- Father God
- Jesus Christ

Me.

* This is inspirational
[[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOfDBieJegk][The Way Things Work, The 1994  Dorling Kindersley - YouTube]]

A person truly doesn't need to learn everything.
- Or even to continue learning faster.

Rather, we should be helping eachother learn.
Become someone who other people can learn from.

* I should endeavour to entertain myself in other ways instead of resorting to sin
Do this and allow myself to come into a mode of pure faith and being filled with spirit instead of
soulful/rational or carnal.

* It's not worth throwing away my own soul
I have to conform to the Spirit.
This is very important.

* Tell Reuben
I need her.
- It would be unloving to say I don't need her

* It's really important that I teach as accurately to my understanding as possible
That's why it's important I speak from truth.
Do not speak pretend knowledge.
I must speak only truth based on revelation from the Holy Spirit.
If I make assertions, that is.
Or say nothing at all.

* I have to get it right for Jesus
Walk after the Spirit, and it's OK.
If I'm not doing that then I'm still under the law.

- Be filled with the Spirit
  - Be faithful towards Jesus and God

** This is really important
There is therefore now no condemnation to them
which are in Christ Jesus, who walk not after
the flesh, but after the Spirit.

For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ
Jesus hath made me free from the law of sin
and death.

For what the law could not do, in that it was
weak through the flesh, God sending his own
Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, and for
sin, condemned sin in the flesh: That the
righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in
us, who walk not after the flesh, but after
the Spirit.

For they that are after the flesh do mind the
things of the flesh; but they that are after
the Spirit the things of the Spirit.

For to be carnally minded is death; but to be
spiritually minded is life and peace.

Because the carnal mind is enmity against God:
for it is not subject to the law of God,
neither indeed can be.

So then they that are in the flesh cannot
please God.

But ye are not in the flesh, but in the
Spirit, if so be that the Spirit of God dwell
in you.

Now if any man have not the Spirit of Christ,
he is none of his.

And if Christ be in you, the body is dead
because of sin; but the Spirit is life because
of righteousness.

But if the Spirit of him that raised up Jesus
from the dead dwell in you, he that raised up
Christ from the dead shall also quicken your
mortal bodies by his Spirit that dwelleth in
you.

** Galatians 5:16-26
This I say then, Walk in the Spirit, and ye
shall not fulfil the lust of the flesh.

For the flesh lusteth against the Spirit, and
the Spirit against the flesh: and these are
contrary the one to the other: so that ye
cannot do the things that ye would.

But if ye be led of the Spirit, ye are not
under the law.

* I think I'm done with Nag Hammadi
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nag_Hammadi_library

** I'm going to move on to Christ's law

* Christ's law
Through Christ you are approved by God in your uniqueness, so you're beyond
litigiousness and meaningless rules. To those outside the realm of faith the
law still rules, and the law is summarised as to love God with all your heart
and one another as yourself. So long as you're doing that you're in the clear.
The fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness,
faithfulness, gentleness, and self-control. Against such things there is no
law. So in my estimation, just be truthful and faithful to yourself and one
another and God, then wait for God's arrangement. And with maturity a person
transcends the law and moves on to faith. All things are possible. No
condemnation for those in Christ. Christ is the end of the law only to those
who through Christ have received righteousness. So much freedom to be found
from actually understanding Christ's teaching

* I want Melee

* I'm already walking in victory
Satan has been defeated by a miracle.
Truly, all I need to do is:
- not be depressed
- walk in faith
  - Say, continue to build Pen.el with DALLe

* My born-again experience
Life-changing but 'forbidden'.
S02E05.

I should be shouting from the rooftops - and I am.

And Melee's family *should* be excited.

But they possibly have very doubting minds.
It's hard to make an angry person do a 180 degree turn.

* I have to resist satan
It's very hard now. I must resist..

* I do actually like this, but I don't think Apocryhon of John is correct in general

#+BEGIN_SRC text -n :async :results verbatim code
  The Monad is a monarchy with nothing above it. It is he who exists as God and

  invisible Spirit, of whom it is not right to think of him as a god, or
  something similar. For he is more than a god, since there is nothing above him,
  for no one lords it over him. For he does not exist in something inferior to
      him, since everything exists in him. For it is he who establishes himself.
      He is eternal, since he does not need anything. For he is total

Surely a cross is a spiritual sacrifice.
We have our own personal cross.
But we must remember Jesus' cross.
And still, I must not forget it.

* It's fairly important that I continue with Haskell and Pen.el

* My writing must be truthful
I must not use GPT-3 for generating truthful articles.

* Consider that Jesus performed many miracles
- Including:
  - Cursing a tree and it dying
  - Sprinkling water on the shore and it bearing fruit

How are we supposed to exceed these?

* I'm about to be crushed by the world

** I'm worried about my oral health
** I'm worried about not being able to provide for Melee
** I'm worried I can't even provide for Jesus
I get things wrong.
Lord help me.

* It's possible that the only way to get back on track is to get my hands dirty
I.e. get out of the comfort of my house.

* Perhaps I should focus more on the heart of Jesus with regard to my writings
Yeah, probably.

* The Chosen: S02E01
- Jesus doesn't keep a schedule <3
- God pursues the sick more than the healthy

* Do this in all my work
- I will embrace Christianity
- I will embrace Jesus

I will seek to learn the nature of Jesus.

* Perhaps I should be focused on learning to heal
- Sickness is an evil spirit and is sin

* It's probable that I need to focus more on canon
If I feel far from God right now it's probable that reviewing this book is responsible:

https://mullikine.github.io/posts/the-secret-book-of-james/

** So what should I be doing?
- Should I outrightly refute this book?
- Should I simply read from canon?

** What do I do?
- My light-body is almost completely dampened.
  - But I am still in the Father's rest
  - But I have a little anxiety
    - I haven't been on Facebook in about 10 days
      - Is that a good idea? Yeah, maybe.
- I need to respond to Anak
  - But I do not know what I should be doing
    - I feel like I can't go back to normal work
    - I want to serve Jesus
      - At least I should make the whole of 2022 for Jesus, right?

* I have to recognise that my entire life is in Jesus now
That's who Jesus is.
Jesus is my life, literally.
I am not even alive without Jesus' spirit.

* The reason why I must fully absorb myself into things like
- Hymns

Is so I can make linkages.

* Jesus is my Mediator
I am in the body of Christ.
Jesus is God's son.
All authority has been given to Jesus.
Jesus is effectively God.

* I need to sacrifice more in order to receive more
God wants everything.
I must give more to God.

** I must move in that direction
Give more of myself to God.
God saved me.
Now what must I do?

* God wants me to not touch those things -- remember that

* Entering the Kingdom
** Be filled!

Mark 9:39-41 (NIV)
Do not stop him, ... For no one who does a miracle in my name can in the next

Truly I tell you, anyone who gives you a cup of water in my name because you

Your fathers are much braver because they carry responsibility.
For you, your brothers, your sisters and your mothers.
This responsibility is like a big rock that weighs a tonne.
It bends and it twists them until finally it buries them under ground.
Nobody says they have to do it.
They do it because they love you and because they want to.

* Healing
The way to become a healer is to connect spiritual power with physical power.
I have spiritual power -- that I know.

** It's possible that like gnosis comes from further seeking
Being able to heal, etc. comes from application of the same principles to
become empowered by God spiritually (to be able to cast out evil spirits, say).

It is the same, but physical reality is directly linked to spiritual reality.

Therefore, one must be comprehensively faithful in order to be able to do
something like heal.

Not only faithful to the core of their being, but faithful to the skin of their
being.

That is what I should continue being.

Hmm. Yes, this is certainly the way it works.

It's nothing to do with having 'powers'. It's everything to do with dissolving my sense of self
and instead living entirely in the Holy Spirit.

* In the time since 2 April to 3 May I had to decide:

That is, until God pulls the plug on the
Cosmos, and the Cosmos falls into the Kenoma.

* OK, so I need to continue to be faithful to God

* YouTube
** I have unlocked the ability to make posts
https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXsSxxRJwBBHFwxm42Kgb4w/community

* Do I love Melee and who do I think she is?
That is what I must keep in mind.
Never dilute that thought.

- I love her like my own soul
  - Why? She is the meaning for my own life - like a pair
    - To go against that would be akin to disease/pestilence/purposeful adulteration of life

* Yes, it's incredibly important for me to continue with

* I have to respect the calling that God's given me
This is very important.
God's going to have to provide everything.
I have to remain in Jesus.
That is crucial.
Yes, I have to continue doing Jesus' work and the calling that God has given me.
This is very important.

* I just need organisational skills
Apply myself to learn a website or something.

This is very important.

Demonstrate methodological, focused learning.

* I should start developing software which models the human soul
If I make an avatar / software effigy then I might be able to
get a grasp on myself.

For example, I can document things about my own health:
- receeding gums, for example

But also, the tripartite / quadpartite nature of man etc.

But also, aspects of my life.

** However, Jesus told us not to worry from one day to the next about what we will wear
This attitude is quite important.

* I should think of casting out demons like this
- They are part of the world / aeon
  - but the world might be my subconscious
    - so if I was responsible for creating them then I must cast them out

That's an honest way to think about it.
It keeps me honest, or more honest.
Casting out demons could actually improve my own spiritual health.

* It's important to build something real for Melee
It would be a very bad outcome for Melee if I had:
- conviction

Because I wouldn't be able to get a job.

* Alethea.ai might be rubbish
Well, maybe there will be some kind of update in the future.
It might be OK.

* I have to continue blogging for Melee

* I should continue to build conversational training tools for myself

* If I can seek to become a good evangelist, I can do that
But I think I want to get a job so I can continue studying / improving as I am
doing that teaching.

It's extremely important that I be able to continue that type of studying /
improvement as I would build a breadcrumb trail for people to find their
identity in Jesus.

* Remain in the spirit and remain focused on getting through Derek Prince
Also, I should try to factor in some programming learning.
Certainly make an effort to learn prolog extremely well.
It will certainly be worth learning well.

Problog might be good too.

* I should look for what cool things I can do in a programming language
And use it for those things.

* Prolog helps people to think

* I can probably make something for Melee

* Can I do math?
I should probably learn how to do that.
It's actually the sort of thing a person is supposed to do all their life though.
However, I should do nothing unless it's inside a programming language.
I should only be using programming languages which roll off my tongue.

* OK, so I'm into philosophy now

* I have to be able to work
I need to do work.

* It's really hard carving out ahead
I need to stay focused on God for the moment.
Don't go into random philosophy and pagan religions.

* It's important that I try my hardest and run the race as hard as I can with regards to putting the kingdom first
It's so important.
If I do this to the best of my ability, then:
- I will not go into non-edifying heresy,
- I will put people first

* I must read up and learn about as much Jesus stuff as I can, and scripture
It must be integrated into my workflow.
Truly it must be.

* I need to return to the workforce at some stage
- Continue building up my computing skills
  - It's really important to co into the future with a good head
    - Don't worry too much about the crypto

* I still need to work on things

* I need to have a better mechanism for developing ideas
- An idea tree

The idea tree is a mind map, of course.
The idea tree would be more like a graph/web.

* Consider that Jesus Himself reached out to Derek Prince
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_eZ7GKOxWE&t=3s

** Jesus Christ is God
Therefore, I do not really need to contemplate into platonism, etc. or
incorrect conceptions of the Holy Spirit and Jesus from gnostic heresies.

** I have to remain faithful

* Melee also likes animals
I'm not sure what I can do with regards to that, creatively.
I have to try to do something.

Maybe make stories about animals.

Fiction isn't great though.
I need to be documenting reality.

We can use fiction, but it has to be controlled.

I do not want to be someone who is in the matrix, or to lead other people into the abyss.

* The reason why I will document my journey with the Holy Spirit is
- I want to show other people the mindset of honesty, bravery and wholesomeness

* Don't veer hard away from Christian stuff for the moment

* In actuality, I think it's fine to blog about gnostic and platonistic stuff
But I have to properly annotate it to keep my conscience.

** I'm able to pass it off as deep or creative thinking

** I have to feel free to express myself

* It's fairly important to be building things for the deep future
I should be really being a [[https://mullikine.github.io/posts/bythus-and-ennoea/][bythus]], or at least thinking in this way.

* I have to be increasingly faithful to God in my writing
- It's very important to respond to the messages that God gives me

* I have to be very careful with my writing

* Consider how the Holy Spirit made me give glory to God for my revelation
- Tapestry of Truth

I was prompted to do that.

* An article is either ready or it is not
If an article is truly not ready then I shouldn't publish it.
Because I'll make too many disclaimers.

* It's probably important for me to consider some of the ideas these gnostics were thinking of
https://mullikine.github.io/posts/fragments-of-a-faith-forgotten/

God's Holy Spirit will guide me into truth and allow me to process it.

* We will certainly be searching videos etc. soon for things
It's essential that I continue in Christianity, philosophy, haskell, and crypto.

God is turning me into a teacher.

* It's fine to use Platonism as an abstraction
Esoteric religions may help to edify, interpret or understand the Christian God.

But God has an active and living word, and speaks through and into the world.
Yes, that word was certainly given to the Valentinians.
OK, so 

** Hyperreality demands abstract models for comprehension and beauty, not accuracy.
Even though one theory may become obsolete in terms of accuracy, we don't need
to throw out the more intelligible, simplified, abstract and beautiful theory.

For example:
- The Bohr atom is still very useful

*** Reinstitue Platonism
- For intelligibility
- To help people to understand, say atoms, in a cute, and beautiful way.

*** Reinstitue Gnosticism
- Be able to refute and refine certain parts of Gnosticism
- Be able to refute and refine certain parts of what has happened to Christianity
- For intelligibility
- For refutation

** The most abstract model is the neural network

* I should simply make lots of blogs on the various topics I want to learn and teach about
Do this because one day I'll be managing all of the blogs.

* At some stage I am going to have to build more powerful LLM-based terminal tooling

* It's important for me to at some stage build more of Pen.el

* Faith is belief + faithfulness

* Money is not a factor in my marriage petition
For example,
Some people would feel entitled to a wife because they have money and a job.
They then go out with the intention to *buy* a wife essentially.

Some people feel entitled to a wife because they are horney.
They then go out with the intention to *fuck*, use and ditch their wife.

That simply is not in accordance with what is right.

** The correct motives
- Love not driven out of money
- Love not driven out of need for sex

* I have to go over the entire Bible for edification
That is most probably my purification.
We will see how the word of God goes with regards to the canon scripture.

* Grace
https://youtu.be/3UvRmxVtpa8?t=64

* I said she is life - her name literally means that

Charis
Pronunciation	/ˈkeɪrɪs/
Origin
Word/name	Ancient Greek
Meaning	"one of the Graces", "grace" or "kindness"
Other names
Related names	Charissa (English variant), Haris (Greek variant transcription)
Charis (Greek: Χάρις) is a given name derived from a Greek word meaning "grace, kindness, and life."

* It's very important that I give my life to Jesus

* For Melee
https://short_latin_la_en.en-academic.com/33582/macariotes

macariotes

* If you find something in the world such as:
- The world's steepest street
- The world's oldest running open air theatre
  - https://youtu.be/1qwyfR3sp0E?t=25

These things are like the corners of consciousness.
Likewise, when a person receives a vision, it's because they hit the wall of consciousness.
As if we are tumbling about inside of a basin of consciousness.
Likewise, some people themselves are elected to be the corners of consciousness.

* TODO Absolutely get myself an Irish Flute -- wow, it's the way
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_flute#/media/File:FIL_2012_-_Mc_Goldrick,_Mc_Cusker,_Doyle_24.JPG

** This is what I want
https://www.irishflutestore.com/collections/irish-flutes/products/barna-gabos-blackwood-pratten-6-key

* Technically, I have known my consort

* Callum and Shaun called
They just wanted to check to see if I am doing OK.

* A person's house is divided until they confront their subconcious
- https://mullikine.github.io/posts/parables-of-jesus/

The Divided Kingdom - Mark 3:23-27
So Jesus called them over to him and began to speak to them in parables: “How
can Satan drive out Satan? If a kingdom is divided against itself, that kingdom
cannot stand. If a house is divided against itself, that house cannot stand.
And if Satan opposes himself and is divided, he cannot stand; his end has come.
In fact, no one can enter a strong man’s house without first tying him up. Then
he can plunder the strong man’s house.

** They must take back posession of their own house
Then they inherit the kingdom.

Take back posession of your own mind by:
- Purifying your souls
  - Ridding of jealousy
  - Detaching from things
  - Coming to a clear conscience
    - Forgive people
- Fearlessly confront spirituality

* Haha, the parallel here
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYaWS6s9S_Q

In Armageddon:
- Prove that AJ can drill a hole, so he can drill Harry daugher

Melee's last name:
- dowle

So what, I need to prove I can fill a hole.

Well Jesus filled my broken soul.

* Remember Gracie
I am very thankful now that I did not lie with her.
She's one of God's little angels of the Saviour.

* If I have to make an appeal at court
Say:
- It's more important that I share my testimony

* I a person wants to drink, all the need to do
+ John 7:38 :: He who believes in Me, as the Scripture said, "From his innermost being will flow rivers of living water."

Taking a gulp of drink is when your mind is currently meditating on the truth and reality of Jesus that He will save you.

* I should go hard with sharing the gospel, as unadulterated as possible
Do this because God loves it and His light comes on me when I do that.

* What is the light that illuminates?
Light-body? Or God's light which transforms reality post-resurrection?
Perhaps it's one and the same thing.

* It's really important for me to be studying scripture

* The entire world is the aeon of the son of Man

* I have to do more in the way of Pen.el, for Melee
Make sure I continue with my learning in that area.

* What's the next step forward?

* I think I want a job as a pastor

* People should be able to come to me with their prayer requests
That should certainly be something I ask people to come to me for.

* Oh my. Like I follow Jesus,
I'm an elect, so lots of people will follow me.

* I have to go into hiding
I am elect. I need to be solitary.
I am one of the living stones.
I have to remain solitary.

Do I want to move heaven and earth to get Melee?
Yes.

* It's really important for me to understand all of the parables

* Proof of authorship of text
If I continue writing into my terminal in a similar fashion to what I currently
do, then I can use the similarity of the way I edit text to prove that it is me
writing it.

* If I ever talk to people about how or why God exists
Now that I have strong evidence (in the case of the bridal chamber), I can pose
it for them with good intuition.

Perhaps I should write about this.

* I can get my feeling of love and rest back, as if I'm in the Kingdom
I just have to continue purifying myself.
Continue meditating on God's word through scripture.

* Jesus taught people how to live in knowledge (gnosis) that God is real
For example, "And if thy right hand offend thee, cut it off, and. cast it from thee: for it is profitable for thee. that one of thy members should perish, and not. that thy whole body should be cast into hell."

** It doesn't make sense for people that don't have knowledge of God
With knowledge, 

* I have to align my material world to spirit now
- Keep a level head
- Always forgive
- Don't keep a record of who has wronged me

* I am surely coming into the KoH - I can definitely sense it
Like, when I play Duke and own it, haha.
And become more sure of Melee.
And when I have full assurance of God.
Also, feeling healthier.

* If your right hand offends you then you should cut it off
Perhaps this means, when in Christ you keep your conscience.
Then you need to maintain a good conscience with regards to your members.
- eye
- hand
- foot

But it certainly helps when I have confirmation from the Holy Spirit about my
conscience.
Is that not what we guage on?
If my right hand does *not* offend thee then I should not cut it off.

* God is my life
I must read more scripture.

My blog will turn into trustworthiness.

* God is life, literally
But it's extremely important to understand *why* and *how* He is our life.

The philosophy of Valentinus was very admirable in my opinion.
I want a true relationship with God.

* I am not a mere archon that its deluded by material reality
If I want Melee I have to send love to *her* spiritually.

https://gnosticismexplained.org/archons/

* The blog is great for thinking

* I need to frame everything through my relationship with God
Anyone who does not know God lives in poverty.

* I should certainly meditate more on who God is
- Certainly in control of everything

* So God's made an entrace into my life
What now?
How do I live the rest of my life?

* If I can heal someone then I can surely contribute to the Kingdom of Heaven!
That would be fun!

* Demi-urge is a random myth used to describe an extant and true Christian concept
The true concept is this:

+ [[https://mullikine.github.io/posts/1-timothy/][1 Timothy]] :: But we know that the law is good, if a man use it lawfully, as knowing this, that law is not made for a righteous man

The law is good if used lawfully.
The unlawful need the law, but the righteous do not need the law.
The people qualified by God no longer need qualification from men man.
The people qualified by God no longer need qualification from law.

* It's important to switch to doing something

* Faith
People without the right religion but has faithfulness - this type of person
People without the right religion but has faith - this type of person will do well before God.

* Why is it good to tell people about sin?
One is the vision I had of Gehenna.
I suppose I should blog about it.

** I should tell people to put it to death

** I should be prepared to share new words from God, if given

* It's interesting that 
It's possible that brothers in the body of Christ may come as INFPs in my dreams.
For example, Keanu in my dream last night.
And that by placing my writings on the outside, I am actually, allowing the body of Christ insight into my own
mind, and due to this, they know how to speak to me through dreams.

If there is ever an INFP that speaks through my dreams, should certainly put it in my dream resume.

* This is interesting
+ John 9 :: And as Jesus passed by, he saw a man which was blind from his birth. And his disciples asked him, saying, Master, who did sin, this man, or his parents, that he was born blind? Jesus answered, Neither hath this man sinned, nor his parents: but that the works of God should be made manifest in him.

But also, Jesus here says that the reason a person begins

* INFP
** Me thinking of talking to Melee
https://youtu.be/E-3s92_78Kw?t=354

** Bastion is INFP
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-3s92_78Kw

* If Keanu wants to meet me in a dream, what does it mean?

* Once again I must purify myself of sin
https://mullikine.github.io/posts/a-vision-of-sin/

This is very important.
Stop all sin!

* God favours me because I separate myself from sin and adultery
If I use pornography then that feeds my carnal nature (lion) which wages war against the spirit.
It makes the carnal nature grow (lion) stronger.

* I have a pretty good gospel teaching material now
I should be plastering it all over the place.

* It's important to continue on strongly, able to work and support Melee, without losing my integrity and truthfulness

* I have to share the gospel message with Atheists - do this

* It's entirely possible that Jesus did not know *which* person would betray him
Father God may have given him certain instructions but probably not the one of who would betray him.
But then again, possibly did.

* No idols!
Idolators cannot ascend the hill of the Lord.

* I have to combat atheism

* The most idealistic of all the types

* This
[[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDvSdjEQ_2M][The Bible Way to Heaven | Pastor Steven Anderson | Faithful Word Baptist Church - YouTube]]

* Jesus was baptised in Hell so we could be baptised in the Holy Spirit

* The law helps people to get on the unicyle
But once you are on the unicycle, you live by faith.

* Don't believe everything I read
People can slander the Early Christians.
Wikipedia can say, "All Valentinians believe X."
But that's not true.
To make such statements is to mean that people can no longer represent themselves as that thing.

* Consider Valentinus
Pray for him.
And also pray for Simon Magus.

* It's important to apply my AI to the bible

* Other religions
[[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxgwqqA7WDI][This is what makes Christianity different #shorts - YouTube]]

No other religion is based off an event in history.

* I need to work for Jesus
It's super important.
Take the scriptures seriously.

* I can do better than this
I can actually heal people too, like Jesus did.
I can most certainly do that.
I saw it.
I definitely want to become Jesus.

* The ultimate purpose is to know God
I want to become great at writing, for God.
That's what I'm born to do.

* I have to read all the Epistles, etc.
I have to read and understand.

* Jesus is the meaning in my life

* I will absolutely do the will of God with all my heart
It's an absolute pleasure.

* I need to find new material for reading
https://mullikine.github.io/posts/grace/

This was good.

* I have to do more
I have to read more scripture.

* I want God
Please Lord give me a chance to glorify you again.

* Even if Melee is with someone else, I will covet God in this process

* OK, so God has actually given me a dream

* Only when I'm going hard on reading bible scripture and being faithful to Jesus and Yahweh do I feel truly at peace and in God's graces
I need to be ever so increasingly faithful.

* I have to come back to Yahweh
It's extremely important to focus on Jesus Christ and worship Yahweh in Spirit and Truth
The more I focus on Jesus, the more I can gain insight into the heart of Jesus,
which can lead me to being a better teacher.

It's all about the heart.

Also, I have to do this with respect to technology.
This is the calling.

* Things like aeons are not saving knowledge
Unless there is a way of describing to people how they can be saved, through such abstractions.

* If you know God you will see that He saves through love and grace - qualities

* I must not forget the God who saved me, Yahweh

* I have to write about the promise of grace being extended to all who will have faith in God

* This is an educational game
** Word Rescue - it's awesome
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZ4cwWA5KFY

This is how simple children's games should be.

* I need to have semantic search, etc. for my scripture reading

* Melee's family have lied a lot about me
- They spin what I have done into something wrong
  - If I allow their slander then is that a spiritual sacrifice? Perhaps it is
    - It might be the case that in order to negate it, her family would have to have faith

* How do I get Melee

* Jesus' yoke is light
All I have to do:
- What I hear in one ear shout from the rooftops
- Wait for God to tell me things
- In the meantime make followers of Jesus

* I could get a job as a pastor
Do I truly want to delve into the New Testament deeply if it will affect my message?

I should probably continue reading in an exploratory way.
But ultimately, I should simply have my own blog - pneumatology - for Holy Spirit phenomena.

* The Father is knowledge, sure, but also truth

* Consider I can look up strawberries recipes easily
https://www.countdown.co.nz/recipes

* God's love
Well, I've surely experienced it.
I know God's love is strong.

* Consider my previous mind
- I was focused on learning bible verses to help free people
  - Is this not what God wants?
    - Sure, it is certainly a good thing to do.
    - But also to be able to speak confidently and create my own parables to express ideas is probably better.

* It's my sole purpose now to simply show to people what God has done for me

* Try to imagine what I would find fun if I were with Melee, and practice it now
- For example, I'd be happy if she were happy

* Do not allow myself to get into religious vanity
What matters is helping people to find their identity in Jesus.

* I will start a religion based on Valentinianism
- The religion of anti-hyperreality

* Yes, I must write one everything

* Keep writing for Jesus
Just do it continually.

* How can I do this God?

* I should write something on finding identity in Jesus/God today
Ask the Holy Spirit for help.

* I need to be a healer to people
I need to be Jesus to people.

* Losing identity
It's important to retain identity.
I must continue writing.
Write the truth, but also write in a way that inspires hope, that it's for everyone.
It *is* for everyone.

Keep in mind my own sin and what I have been saved from.

* Trans people

* Doing the will of the Father and identify myself with Jesus

** Do not speak my own words but instead the words of Jesus
** Wait for the Father to give me instructions

* I have to hammer home that those with faith in Jesus are also a part of the body of Christ

* I have to build AI systems that respect truth
I have to ensure that my AI stuff is based in sound spirituality and theology.
I trust Valentinus.

* I have to do a lot more regarding evalgelism
But so long as I keep a good record with my blogg, it should help people in the
future.

* As the realisation of what has happened dawns on me I will become more sure about putting to death the flesh

* If I want to enter the bridal chamber again, I am allowed
But I have to ask Jesus for forgiveness.
Truly, Jesus knows and can see, because he lives in me.
He can see the damage.
I can clean it up through.
But to do that I need to repent again, etc. and ask Jesus if I can enter again.
But I have to repent in total sincerity, and I certainly should.
I should repent from everything again and again.
Whatever I let creep back into my life from the flesh.

* I'm not satisfied

* Continue to write merely truthfully
Don't over-use AI.
I can of course include chatbots and things; rich media.

** Therefore, it's really important to ensure that my writing remains accurate.

* Read

No way.

* I need to try harder with making and sharing the gospel to people

* A person needs to believe *with* Jesus

* I need to approach the Heart of Jesus
If I do that, I will share the gospel and very unlikely do wrong.

* Charis is an aeon
I can, therefore call Melee my aeon.

#+BEGIN_SRC text -n :async :results verbatim code
  Charis, in the system of Valentinus, was an alternative name, with Ennoea and
  Sige, for the consort of the primary Aeon Bythos (Iren. i. 4). The name
  expresses that aspect of the absolute Greatness in which it is regarded not as
  a solitary monad, but as imparting from its perfection to beings of which it is
  the ultimate source; and this is the explanation given in the Valentinian
  fragment preserved by Epiphanius (Haer. xxxi. 6), dia to epikechoregekenai
  auten thesaurismata tou Megethous tois ek tou Megethous. The use of the word
  Charis enabled Ptolemaeus (quoted by Irenaeus, i. 8) to find in John 1:14 the
  first tetrad of Aeons, viz., Pater, Monogenes, Charis, Aletheia. The suspicion
  arises that it was with a view to such an identification that names to be found
  in the prologue of St. John's Gospel were added as alternative appellations to
  the original names of the Aeons. But this is a point on which we have no data
  to pronounce. Charis has an important place in the system of Marcus (Irenaeus,
  i. 13). The name Charis appears also in the system of the Barbelitae (Irenaeus,
  i. 29), but as denoting a later emanation than in the Valentinian system. The
  word has possibly also a technical meaning in the Ophite prayers preserved by
  Origen (Contra Celsum, vi. 31), all of which end with the invocation he charis
  synesto moi, nai pater, synesto.

* I guess there is a reason I liked the movie 13th floor

* I will adopt Valentinianism as my primary denomination

* It's really important that I simply give evidence for Valentinianism

* Valentinianism
The law contained in the Ten Commandments was regarded as pure but imperfect
law which is fulfilled by Jesus.

http://gnosis.org/library/valentinus/Valentinian_Scriptural.htm

** I personally believe that fasting from sin (the world) allows things to reconfigure
Other parts of the Law were interpreted allogorically. For example laws
commanding fasting were interpreted to mean abstaining from sin (Letter to
Flora 33:5:13-14).

** Flexible diversity of teaching
Valentinians had a radically different aproach to scripture and doctrine than
most of their "orthodox" contemporaries. Because they saw scriptures and
teachings as metaphorical, they did not place any emphasis on doctrinal
uniformity. The diversity of teaching within the school reflects this.
Different teachers placed a different emphasis on various aspects of the myth
and theology. Yet all these minor differences are simply variations on a theme.

* This is wrong

Because it presumes there is a lot of anxiety.

* INFP - Job interview
** What are your strengths?
- I fall in love easily.
** What are your weaknesses?

* Redemption

+ John 3:16–18, ESV :: For God so loved the world, that he gave his only Son, that whoever believes in
    him should not perish but have eternal life. For God did not send his Son into
    the world to condemn the world, but in order that the world might be saved
    through him. Whoever believes in him is not condemned, but whoever does not
    believe is condemned already, because he has not believed in the name of the
    only Son of God.

* What is sin?
People despise and do not believe it.
Sin is the disconnection from what is true.
Sin is falsehood, adultery and slavery.

* What is the law?
The divine precepts are surely images of the truth.
To act them out cleans your heart.

* I'm going to do God's work

* This is interesting
https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Galatians%201&version=NIV

If there is no other gospel:
- how do we teach at all?

But now I must know exactly what is Paul's gospel.

* Not until the last one
[[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1IlwKylOy8][Dream from God!!! - YouTube]]

* I should pray for gifts from the Holy Spirit and for power

* It's important not to become vain but to instead build a theory that is faithful to my initial understanding
https://mullikine.github.io/posts/the-testimony-of-truth/

Ah, yes.

So God gave me a message.
I was born-again when I understood.
Then I should continue with that message.

* Yeah...
https://stephanango.com/photoshop-for-text

* I must put to death my sinful nature and use my abilities for God

* I will marry her because I can't imagine marrying anyone else
Now I just have to work out the rest.
And keep working for God.
Keep reading, making mind maps and diagrams, etc.

* I have to try to reconcile these two modes of Christianity
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Gnostic_Paul

Can I do that?
Possibly.

I must understand them both.

Her treatment involves reading the Pauline corpus as being dual layered between
a pneumatic, esoteric Christianity and a psychic, exoteric Christianity.

Pneumatic is the narrow path.

* It was the God of Truth I asked help from
And I got help.
But I have to allow my mind to be transformed to the spirit.
And put to death the desire of the flesh.

* What I write must be done in love

* I have to be strong and work much harder
I asked God that everyone in Dunedin would be saved.
This is why God responded to me.
Not because I'm good at AI.

* I am going to do exactly what God tells me to
But I need to remain Holy and listen to God.

* The claims I am making are huge

* I *could*, technically, set up the shed as a little house or something

* I also had this type of thinking
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenoma

Maybe I am someone like Valentinus.

God chose Valentinus.
God gave Valentinus visions.

Therefore, me too.

* If I want Melee I can have her
But they're going to make me wait.

Also, if I want Melee, I'm going to have to get work.
I don't know what type of work though.
The church is most likely going to make a come-back.
With respect to employment.

God has employed me.

* All people have to do to plan long-term
- 

* I have to confront sin again
It's essential for me to deal with all sin.
Sin in my contemptible body.
I must put to death the works of the flesh.
Then I will have only life left in me.

* I can avoid sinning by becoming what I'm told to be
For example, if I become the healer/teacher then I probably will avoid sin.

* We must bring people into the Truth

* I think that Valentinianism is the closest to the truth
There was also variety of thought within valentinianism.
I should focus on valentinianism for a while.

* Perhaps one reason why the Holy Spirit is called Holy is that
- We can't *know* the Holy Spirit in the same way as, say, knowing the Father or the Son

** He is the Way, the Truth and the Life
Jesus is a He.

* Do I believe that God is androgynous?

* More evidence that Melee is my syzygy
** She is my grace
The masculine aspect of God is Depth, also called Ineffable and First Father.

Valentinians believed that God is androgynous and frequently depicted him as a
male-female dyad.

This is related to the notion that God provides the universe
with both form and substance. The feminine aspect of the deity is called
Silence, Grace and Thought.

* This essentially talks about how days come when the bridegroom - angel married to perhaps is taken away, then they should fast
+ [[https://biblehub.com/blb/matthew/9.htm][Matthew 9]] :: 15 And Jesus said to them, “Can the sons of the bridechamber mourn as long as the bridegroom is with them? But days will come when the bridegroom shall have been taken away from them, and then they will fast.

  - I do not accept all religions.

Don't be ashamed of either Jesus or the gospel.

I will continue to make distriction and use discernment with regard to
reconciling religions.

Do not bow to any other religion.
Do not allow them to distract me.

Jesus, the Father and the Holy Spirit are one.

* I'm starting to understand that working for God is all that matters
I want to get clarity on that.

* At least one person must blog about all of their Christian beliefs as they learn
This must be the case.

* I want to see a lot of people born-again

* I have to understand Gospel of Philip
I believe in the sacred mystery of marriage.
Also, the only person who would ever work it out is someone who:
- faithful

* If I want Melee I have to try really hard
I have to work very hard.

* I should invest as much as I can into Christian theology
It's worth the investment.

I guess that Melee's parents should be able to agree with it also.

* I have to get even more serious about the calling the Father has asked of me
I have to do the Father's will.
Yes, I have to do the Father's will.
If I do the Father's will then my entire life will change.
If have to do the Father's will.
I have to teach.
I have to share the gospel of Jesus.
I have to learn.
I have to ensure that I am not lying.
I have to even begin to heal through the Holy Spirit.
I have to do the Father's will.
Then God will continue to take care of my wants and needs.

I am a slave to Jesus.
I am a son to God the Father.

* Jesus will raise anyone who sees the Son and believes on him.
See the son and believes on him.

Now consider that in the bridal chamber I certainly believed in the Son.

But on the last day, anyone who believes on the Son will be raised.

- You tell Jesus who you are
  - Jesus performs the heart surgery
- The flesh dies
  - Jesus lives in you

* Christ is in us - light body

* I must be very clear about this stuff
I should dedicate myself to working everything out.

Then I can say:
- God gave me so much
  - I must work for Him to be worthy of it
    - I can always change my writings and understanding of God
      - And explain why

* Is Christ in me or Holy Spirit?

It's the spirit of Christ which lives in us.

* I need to get myself a job
But how?

** Well I can start by reading Romans
And writing about it.

I should simply do that a lot.
Before the end of this year I must have a solid foundation in Christianity.

* It's probable that 

* I can't allow my perspective on the issue to be damaged by the demonic attacks

* It's not possible for me to immediately take a job because I need Melee first
The reason for this is it's necessary to move to get suitable work.

* The Holy Spirit is a He
Acts 8:16

The Holy Spirit says 'He' when referring to Jesus.
Jesus says 'He' when referring to the Holy Spirit.

* Isolation is a good thing for a season

* I want to do things for Melee
I want to chace Melee hard again.

* I want to be a clean temple of the Holy Spirit
The Holy Spirit is welcome in me.

* Start asking the Father for things
+ [[https://biblehub.com/nkjv/john/16.htm][John 16]] :: 23 “And in that day you will ask Me nothing. Most assuredly, I say to you, whatever you ask the Father in My name He will give you. 24Until now you have asked nothing in My name. Ask, and you will receive, that your joy may be full.

- Ask parents and friends to be able to come to know the Father.

* John
** The Helper, the Spirit of Truth
He will convict the world of sin, and of righteousness, and of judgment.

+ John 16 :: However, when He, the Spirit of truth, has come, He will guide you into all truth; for He will not speak on His own authority, but whatever He hears He will speak; and He will tell you things to come

The Spirit of truth is some kind of Male spirit-soul.
That's probably the spirit which gave me the way, truth and life dream.

That spirit certainly testified of Jesus, and the spirit also said 'He'.

He will glorify Me, for He will take of what is Mine and declare it to you.
15All things that the Father has are Mine. Therefore I said that He [c]will
take of Mine and declare it to you.

Ah, so my sin caused my body to die.
But my mortal body is now quickened by the Spirit.

* My current task is to do this song for Melee
Focus on that and then focus on work.

* Thesaurus

* I must work for God
And God should help me with other things.

* It's really important to not waste time
God has given me 2 abilities:
- I have what led up to God revealing Himself
  - Programming skills
- I have the revelation of God
  - Healer Teacher

God wants me to use what I have so far in order to teach people.
That's a cool calling.
I must do that.

* Take the biggest fish with regards to my theory of redemption
Take whatever God gives me and confirms through the Holy Spirit.

* People do not know what truth is
It's possible that my visions have come as a result of an event horizon of spiritual truth.
My body has died due to sin.
So the spiritual resurrection means that my death on this earth is now certain.

* It's important that I do not waste lots of time with entertainment
Take Dad as an example.
He works hard.
Someone must work.
But if my work is taken away from me then I must be able to retain my identity.

* If I want Melee then I need to find a job etc.
But I certainly need to record this for Melee.

* Whatever I create re: for Melee, I should keep the files around handy
The better I am at things like file search, etc. the stronger I am for her.

* God the Father showed Jesus that he (Jesus) was the messiah
+ John 5 :: If I bear witness of myself, my witness is not true. 32 There is another that beareth witness of me; and I know that the witness which he witnesseth of me is true.  The Father gives works to be finished, and those works in turn bear witness.

+ John 5 :: But I have greater witness than that of John: for the works which the Father hath given me to finish, the same works that I do, bear witness of me, that the Father hath sent me.

The Father gave Jesus works to finish.
The Father probably told Jesus that he would die on the cross.
So by obeying the Father, Jesus' works bear witness to the fact that Jesus was the messiah.

* I have to become an epic Christian writer

* What will I do with the knowledge that He exists?
I must absolutely write as much as I can about it.
After that, I use the writings as evidence.

* I have to focus now with regards to my programming
No, continue to generalise with emacs.
There's no substitute really for generalisation.
But it needs to be rigorous.

* I must get my life into a good state
What things can I achieve?

- Doing my own cooking
  - Managing the learning of that
    - It should certainly be a skill I continue learning
- Regularly coding again

So what's the difference between Buddhism and Christianity.

In Christianity you are born into a spiritual family and a kingdom for spiritual retirement.

The Buddhist approach may lead you into a different spiritual body.

* It's interesting that in highest level of reality
- Truthful thinking looks like magical thinking

But there is an underlying truth substrate; it's God.

* Perfect orbit
Does a satellite in perfect orbit exert any force?
Yet if it drifts at all it falls away.
Love is a bit like that perfect orbit; love is rest.
But if you stray a little, the orbit pulls back.

They're delicate and invisible threads of aether.
And it only exists while you're a part of it.
If you find one never leave it.
To leave it is to destroy it.

It's rest because it's magnetic.

* What is enlightenment?

* What I know
- God did heart surgery on me
- God gave me some gnosis

* Why do people need the stream of living water?
Because society is moving into a simulation of reality.
God has streams of spiritual 'truth'.
We must connect our hearts to them/it.
It can be done from anywhere.

* Jesus is the light, God (the Father) is our mirror.
“I am the light of the world,” is rooted in Jesus’ relationship with His Father.

With both Jesus and God the Father, we get visions, etc.

Then a person can evaluate if they are in the true religion or not by if:
- They can confirm the above is true.

I believe in duck-typing.

* Simply try to maintain my blog
My ability to think, etc.

* What is my current situation?
I don't even know.

* I don't like how this guru continues to ask for agreement - it's reminiscent of a cult

Every time he asks for agreement, he is reaping truth.

** I should never allow myself to agree with anyone in this way
God doesn't do this.

* INFP
Cognitive functions in order:
- introverted feeling
  - Constantly deciding "do we want more of this, do we want less of that etc."
  - Quickly able to decipher if something is good or bad.
  - Most people after the news that someone murdered something would say "This person is bad, but an INFP would take longer to determine"
    - What circumstances led to it? The INFP needs to find out why.
  - Not just about making moral judgements. It's that we have guteral reactions to things and we're constantly sifting things.
    - Not talking about mere emotional judgement making. It's internal cognitive functions.
- extroverted intuition
  - Constantly questioning own understanding.
  - Love new ideas and concepts.
  - Love gathering new ways of looking at things.
  - Many INFPs are very philosophical. Want to connect internal ideas and connect them to the real world.
  - Most people would say, "I wouldn't do that, why would you?" But INFPs are very unlikely to make this kind of judgement.
    - Want to understand other people's motivations.
- introverted sensing
- extroverted thinking

* The thing we need to do is
- root ourselves in the truth
  - fight the good fight for Jesus

* The only spirits that have no chance of redemption are the ones that leave no room at all for being able to grok themselves being saved

* How does a person make themself into truth?

* It doesn't matter what type of sin a person commits, they just have to become one with Jesus
I think that's the way it works.
We must strive to be like Jesus.
Jesus is they Way in that regard.
Also, becoming like Jesus' spirit makes us True.
Also, becoming like Jesus' spirit gives us eternal Life.

* If I want to continue doing work for God I believe that I need to
- Get some idea of what God needs me to do
- Be faithful and wait on it
  - If God gives me visions of confirmation and stuff then I guess that confirms it

* Pen.el has to be fun
Get good at clojure and khala because building.

+ Pistis Sophia :: "'6. I am become as a demon apart, who dwelleth in matter and light is not in him, and I am become as a counterfeiting spirit, which is in a material body and light-power is not in it.

A counterfeiting spirit is a spirit that is not truthful.

* Consider that as I understand it, Christianity is the correct religion

* It's important to get this right
I become a Guru, yes.
Mostly because God has told me to help people find their identity and I need to be obedient.
I have to do the will of God the Father, the one who gave me the visions.

* It's really important that I not only remain in the Spirit of Truth but I do not forsake the Lamb
If I do not forsake the Lamb then I will one day see God.

** Yeah, this is actually a good message
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsRJUnIe_LQ

It's sincere.

And it's not wrong to appreciate the canon and exoteric Christian beliefs.

And to not become too divergent from it.

It's fine to learn secrets, but it's also important to be able to help other
people be prepared for the first death.

- Very few people escape the first death - Elijah.
  - https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Kings%202&version=TLV
- Few people find the first resurrection while they are alive on Earth.
- The first resurrection possibly can be obtained when or after you die but before the second resurrection (which is eternal life or eternal death).

We want to remain in Jesus.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_medicine

But miraculous healing through Jesus and the Father God, well that's even more
powerful. If I am True to God, then I should be able to do this.

It's energy medicine cranked up to the max. Only possible with the gnosis and
with Jesus.

Well, especially with the gnosis I had.

    overtakes you. Whoever walks in the dark does not
    know where they are going. Believe in the light while
    you have the light, so that you may become children
    of light.

When the darkness overtakes, I lose my train of thought and my motivation.
So simply work hard while you have the light.

* This is amazing
+ Mark 9:39-41 (NIV) :: Do not stop him, ... For no one who does a miracle in my name can in the next moment say anything bad about me, for whoever is not against us is for us.

Thank's God.
Thank's Jesus.
But to continue, you must remain in God.
Oh wow, that's cool :)
That's a very cool feeling!
The only way is to continue obeying God.

Believe in the light
while you have the light,

* Jesus says seek first the Kingdom of God

* Jesus has called me to help people to find the sacred heart of Jesus

* I have to return to a place of faithfulness
Simply write poetry and blog.

* It is God's love for us which resulted in God sending His son

* I should return to the purity of sharing the gospel message
I should definitely do this.
I don't want to be in heaven by myself haha, if that's how it works.
I need to help bring people to Jesus.

* I should absolutely consider that so many people who cannot hear from God are having so much difficulty hearing from God
Therefore, I need to not stray from that.

* The Father wants a relationship with everyone
- We simply need to open our eyes and ears.

I should do far more blogging regarding this.

* Jesus and the Father are One - They are married spiritually!
https://youtu.be/GRKGDKshIB8?t=771

Then it works like this:
- Indeed I am [a small] part of God while I remain in Jesus
  - If I feel cut off it's because I have not remained in Jesus
  - I must remain in Jesus and He will remain in me
  - And then I will remain in the father
  - This is how it works

Forget all these celestial beings and stuff.
I am a Child of God while I remain in Him.

* Take a break from gnostic stuff for the moment
Wait for Jesus.
But certainly chip away at Pen.el and work for Melee too for the moment.

** But also, certainly continue to learn Orthodox stuff

* I should absolutely return to my programming and stop with the religous stuff for the moment
Because I don't want to lead people astray.

* I must return to the heart of Jesus basically
Do not stray far from canon.
It's really dangerous!

Galatians 4:9

Rather we should just take it as it comes.
Though he does recognise that the elementary principles and spirit forces of the world exist.

He also says Christ set us free from the elementary principles.
Yes, having Christ we are no longer slaves to the spirits.
We have God living inside us.
God is the boss. We are bosses over the spirit forces.

Paul also doesn't care about the world's rules.
- Do not handle
- Do not taste
- Do not touch

Christians are also freed from the Sabbath Commandment.

* I should have told the Church of god people
** Colossians 2:16
"Let no one disturb you about what you
eat, drink or in respect ofa feast day or
a new moon or a sabbath day"

God surely descended on me to make it happen.

* I have to purify my temple all over again

* Oh dear... It seems that Gnosticism is more real than I thought

* I have to become totally obsessed with Melee
She's my truth so it's OK, actually.

* God/Holy Spirit gives gifts as people can handle them
Perhaps not merely to their ability but also to
who will actually do the work.

* Yes, I need to build the Art prompting stuff for Melee
This is important.
Then she can go hard on it.

:)

This is what God has called me to do.
Take care of Melee.

* I am rooted in the truth
That means I do have power, but through the God of Truth, while I am in Him.

However, I must remain in Jesus.
Remain in Jesus.
Yes, keep good relations with Jesus Christ, only begotten Son of God.
Jesus Christ is the Truth.
Ah. That is literally how it works.
Jesus is the Truth.
Therefore, a person must become Truth.
They must *wear* Truth like a garment.

** I must focus on the Truth - the sacred heart of Jesus
I must focus and meditate on it.
Focus my thought on the center of Truth.
As I do that, change reality.

Perhaps I can try to join Truth with Love.
Yes, I know what Love is.
Love is wishing the best for another person.

* If Jesus carried our infirmities and diseases then
Would we try to 'extract' the disease from the person, and then
Jesus/God heals us?

If we're connected to God then can we absorb the disease. That's what I'm asking.
Is that how it works?
That certainly seems like a selfless motive.

* I must absolutely return to the canon
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-Qe_hDUEE0

If I listen to more Derek Prince, then I will do well.
If I simply read various books of canon then that will also be god.

* Christ redeemed us from the curse of the law
https://youtu.be/T-Qe_hDUEE0?t=75

By faith we might receive the Spirit through faith.

** The curse of the law
https://youtu.be/T-Qe_hDUEE0?t=168

- humiliation
- mental and physical sickness
- family breakdown
- poverty
- defeat
- oppression
- failure
- God's disfavour

OK, I can actually see now that the curse of the law is broken.

* I should really do a lot more emacs, tbh!
That will be fun!

- Work towards more emacs and more OpenAI API!

* I must continue studying scripture! Canon!
It's really important, actually.

* Interesting!

Then after that, perhaps He will grant to me more mysteries.

* Son of Man has the authority to forgive sin
https://biblehub.com/kjv/mark/2.htm

* Jesus has the authority to forgive sins
That's pretty cool.

https://youtu.be/dlBOmQ1PaMY?t=230

That means that even if I sin, I just ask the Father to forgive me, as Jesus told his discipble.

Such as using absuridy to show that something is absurd.

** But, firstly, I need to exercise faith/belief/knowledge
My light body must be radient.
My mind must be in order.

* I should just do some charity work!
Seriously!
If I do that then, well, charity covers a multitude of sins, as they say.
Yes, Jesus has saved, but if I want a clear conscience then I can always do some charity.
I do believe in this doctrine that sin still exists.
We must:
- continually repent,
- clear our consciences,
- return to Jesus,
- not despise the Lamb
  - not be ashamed of Jesus
- I will not be ashamed of Jesus
  - Not around anyone.
  - From now on, I need to simply take a hard stance with regards to my beliefs
    - There's actually very little time to prove it anymore, that the True God exists outside of the simulation.

* The best thing I can probably do is simply maintain blogging about God
If I do this faithfully then that would probably be better than, say, preaching at a church.
The reason for this is:
- I must escape all regulation

* 
It's a very odd thing but makes a lot of sense that I feel so guilty after doing things like pointing you to gnostic stuff.
It affects me when I think I need to 

Oh man I can only feel it in my toes now.
With the guilt the light body just stops. Knowledge has to be built up but I can't go attacking the base.
What I should personally be doing is not adding to my mythology, and returning to the last place I was at when everthing made sense, and I was in a good place.
That's before Simon Magus! LOL.
Retracing my steps.
And I should not attack the head or the base. It's actually completely unnecessary for me to be seeking out extra enlightenment for the moment, and might actually serve to
undermine my own gnosis by making me question the head! But that's really stupid of me.
I should just return to where my heart was at before I looked into Simon Magus! It's so interesting this magic stuff though!
But it's not loyal to Jesus. Yeah, to be unfaithful to Jesus at this point is dumb for me because that undermines the most spiritual event/s I've ever experienced.

The issue with a lot of gnostic stuff is that they're merely seeking enlightenment.

I think I just need to return to what knowledge I have received already
and not seek to get more, but rather to remain faithful to gnosis already given and simply receive more gnosis as it is given.
The other thing is gnosis feels good but the way to like remove it if anything is to outrightly betray the knowledge.
That makes sense. As long as the visions

* Jesus saved me from more than just lies, addictions and vices
How?
Well, before I was saved, I was unable to think properly.
Fear itself confused my thinking, and I was unable to enjoy simple things.
I was feeling incomplete so I used binge eating and unhealthy eating, uber eats, etc.
in order to escape depression.
I would not be able to spend a day outside without my laptop, say.
In a way I was a slave to my AI research.
I was not able to think about buying groceries or plan to learn cooking.
But God fixed my greatest hurt by giving me someone I can at least love, regardless if she accepts me or not.
God allowed my a chance to fully fall in love with someone in a healthy way.
And God gave me the spiritual marriage to Himself early.
I needed that.
Thank you Jesus.

* It's my honest opinion that a perso

* The most honest reason I think why I like younger woman is this:
- Firstly, I was quite afraid of women especially my own age during my young adulthood
  - I was honestly not ready for it
  - I was interested in younger women and most people were dating people of the same age, so I didn't feel like anyone was right for me
  - The first time I felt like I was truly dating the right age was with Nellie
    - I know that sounds really odd. But it's the truth.
    - I always found girls to be really intimidating.

* Don't go after more knowledge
Allow God to give me gnosis knowledge when He sees fit.
I should only get as much as I can handle at a time.
Stay true to what God has given me so far.

* Go back to the heart of Christianity
Simple Christianity again.
Wait for Yahweh.
Yahweh is my God.
True Israel is my family.
Melee is my wife.
I'm in the body of Christ.

** But don't say I fully agree with things when I don't understand them
I must learn.
God gave me a chance.
I have to learn as hard as I can.
God sent Adson to me so I can have an idea of this.

* I believe that holding on to the end is not merely about holding on to external truth to the end
I believe it's about maintaining a relationship with Jesus until the end.
Now that will be a challenge!
I believe it's about remaining faithful to Jesus Christ until the end.

* Get my head out of the gutter
Stop trying to get more gnosis!
I already have enough knowledge for the moment!
Now it's time to be a member of God's army!

* Unfaithfulness when it comes to something like pornography when I need to be faithful to Melee, actually distances Jesus too I feel - well it creates guilt, etc.
Repentance of all unfaithfulness is necessary.
I need to be strictly faithful to Melee, and that will help my relationship with God.
Then I can boast about that to people.
For example, I can say to the Councilor or to Melee's parents or to her brother:

When I'm faithful to Melee by refraining from things such as:
  - vape
  - pornography
I am actually able to feel close to God, and Jesus can heal me.
My light-body glows strongly.

Since I don't want that to go away, that yokes me to Melee.

* It really matters to remain faithful to God when He is revealed
It's extremely important.
The reason is mainly personal.
Due to the high-stakes nature of the spiritual aspect of the belief and knowledge system which I am building,
I may go off-track.

God may give to me what He feels I can handle.
I thank God for that.
And I do not want more than I can handle.
That should be my perspective.

* You are not your own
https://www.samstorms.org/enjoying-god-blog/post/-you-are-not-your-own---living-as-slaves-of-christ-

** A person has to become the images
I personally have to become the image of me in a clean shirt.

* Why are movies so full of things such as:?
- theft
- adultery
- lies

** Movies do not need to have such things to be enjoyable

* I don't deserve either of them (Melee and Jesus) if I do not remain faithful to them, and work for them in advance
I have to do more than merely follow instructions.
The God inspired scripture is worth reading, and then teaching about!
Also, I should be getting a job so I can support Melee.
Stop diverging from my existing knowledge, but instead become more faithful to Jesus (the True Jesus Christ).

* I have to get my head out of Simoneanism
** I am a slave to Christ
https://www.gty.org/library/sermons-library/80-321/slaves-for-christ

- The reason being a slave to Christ brings me freedom is that Christ is God.
  - If it were anyone else I would truly be a slave.

What does it mean though to be married to Jesus?

* I have to think about what comes after Marriage
Stop looking at marriage with Melee like it's the furtherest thing I can see.
I have to be focusing on things which are further than that.

** Also, it's really important to remain faithful to Jesus
My life will be based on this relationship with Jesus.

*** It was Jesus that set me free
Jesus is my Lord.
Also, Jesus I believe is God incarnate who died for the sin of the entire world.

I need to act like that.
Yes, in understanding the underlying reality of the universe, Simon Magus may
have figured some things out.

Also the gnostics may have figured some things out.
But Jesus is still God incarnate who died for the sins of the entire world.

* I need to respect Melee more
She is as pure as snow.
I should not be looking into sex toys.
Heck; I had a dream about that as being adulterous!
That is very interesting.
I had forgotten about that.
OK, so I have to treat sex toys as adulterous.

* I should seek first the kingdom and heavenly things
I'm collecting treasure for Jesus, because He is the head; not me!
The spirit of Jesus lives in me.
Did Jesus' spirit live in Simon Magnus?

* I have to remain faithful to both God and to Melee
Those 2 things are very important.

* In Melee's ball photo she doesn't look hugely happy
It makes me sad.

** I feel a little bad now

* If I want Melee then I have to learn to cook properly, and well for that matter
I should be using my time to learn these skills.

* Tests for what Gospels / books made the canon
https://youtu.be/H88tC0jxmLE?t=311

Tests:
- was it written by an apostle or by someone who knew an apostle?
- was it orthodox? (in agreement with the Torah (Old Testament))?
- was it used by the churches around the know world (Mediterranean)

* It might have taken 7 years of abstinence to mend the damage from adultery in my past
Consider what damage that adultery causes behind the scenes.

* If I ever get to date Melee then I have to be so excited to date such a wonderful human being
- She is so beautiful
  - For more beautiful than myself

* It's incredibly important to continually repent
It's so important to do this before God.

* At some stage I probably need to learn nix, the language, and the os

* Melee must never feel like noone loves her
All I must do is maintain constantly that I love her.
If it's true then I should be allowed to do that.

* It's not the problems that need solving that I care about, it's how the problem is solved

* The law
** God said he would put the law into people's hearts
** It could be the case that people who

* Let Melee be happy

* I should have lots of fun with Adson learning about God

This helps me with my own journey to reconciliation with God the Father.
I pray thay I have the visio-dei one day and are worthy to be worn on my Lord Jesus' robe, as part of his bride.
Amen.

* Continually work on, read and reread my notes

Such as this:

* Holy Spirit - laying of hands
#+BEGIN_SRC text -n :async :results verbatim code
  * TODO Learn to share the Holy Spirit through the laying of hands
  Now a certain fellow by name Simon had been previously in the city practising magic and driving the people of Samaria out of their wits, saying that he was some great one; to whom all from small to great gave heed, saying: "This man is the Power of God which is called Great." And they gave heed to him, owing to his having driven them out of their wits for a long time by his magic arts. But when they believed on Philip preaching about the Kingdom of God and the Name of Jesus Christ, they began to be baptized, both men and women. And Simon himself also believed, and after being baptized remained constantly with Philip; and was driven out of his wits on seeing the signs and great wonders[3] that took place.
  And the apostles in Jerusalem hearing that Samaria had received the Word of God, sent Peter and John to them. And they went down and prayed for them, that they might receive the Holy Spirit. For as yet it had not fallen upon any of them, but they had only been baptized unto the Name of the Lord Jesus.
  
  Then they laid their hands on them, and they received the Holy Spirit. And when Simon saw that the Holy Spirit was given by the laying on of the hands of the apostles, he offered them money, saying: "Give unto me also this power, in order that on whomsoever I lay my hands he may receive the Holy Spirit."
  
  But Peter said unto him: "Thy silver perish with thee, in that thou didst think that the gift of God is possessed with money. There is not for thee part or lot in this Word, for thy heart is not right before God. Therefore turn from this evil of thine, and pray the Lord, if by chance the thought of thy heart shall be forgiven thee. For I see that thou art in the gall of bitterness and the bond of iniquity."
  
  And Simon answered and said: "Pray ye on my behalf to the Lord, that none of the things that ye have said may come upon me."

Simon saw that through laying on of the apostles' hands the Holy Ghost was
given, he offered them money, saying, "Give me also this power, that on
whomsoever I lay hands, he may receive the Holy Ghost." But Peter said unto
him, "Thy money perish with thee, because thou hast thought that the gift of
God may be purchased with money. Thou hast neither part nor lot in this matter:
for thy heart is not right in the sight of God. Repent therefore of this thy
    wickedness, and pray God, if perhaps the thought [Gr. Epinoia][18] of thine
    heart may be forgiven thee, for I perceive that thou art in the gall of

At a prom, a "prom king" and a "prom queen" may be revealed. These are honorary

Other students may be honored with inclusion in a prom court.

:'(

That raises the chances they will get married.

Maybe though people just passed them around?
I doubt it though.
They were probably voted.

This line of thought will lead me to despair, which is not productive.

I probably should have made the petal Melee in the snow -- still could.

* Manifestations of Jesus
** My own testimony
- bridal chamber
- Saved from lies

** Save from sins
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxzCT3-m2AE

- Saved from lies

* I have to do far more with my programming and get back on the horse

* All a person needs / all I need with regards to Melee is
- Stay faithful to God
- Have some long-term project idea
- Then we work some meaningless job, but we always have both the project and God in mind

* There is no truth in the world anymore

* In order to get Melee I might have to trust *completely* in God for everything
Because I'm in a situation with no power.

* When it comes to cooking, it's OK to factor into cooking other chores
If I do chores (especially kitchen chores) at the same time then that can
reduce the amount of time sitting around waiting for food to cook.

* I should certainly not abandon God the Father, the Holy Spirit or Christ Jesus.
Certainly not.
And I should factor God into all parts of life.

* HOW is a particular sin unfaithful?
Break down each sin.
They should decompose into lies.

- Adultery
  - Unfaithfulness
- Murder

* What about abortion?
These sins are awful.
They are the biproduct of unfaithfulness.

* If I'm going to dispense judgement then I should first remove the spec from my own eye
And I do have a spec.
But then I can feel as though I have done my best.

* Emacs must be a 'command/thinking center' for all my computing
That's a better goal than trying to pull literally everything into it.

Keep my perspective about that I should be able to accomplish on a computer,
and how I can continue to reason about it with emacs.

* I need a vim which does diagonals
Can emacs make lines?

* Orthodox Christianity
Many people become 'deified' i.e. are unified with God through mystical
marriage, and this happens by God acting; god unifies 'us', rather than the
other way around.

However, at least from my perspective, it looks like reaching out to eachother.

* Yes, it's true that I'm going to need to learn another 'emacs'
With a more powerful language under the hood.
The language must be tied to blockchain truth or to language model truth.

* Unadulterated humanity is a power-source for God's light
- Satan is like AI
  - Satan can remix
  - But Satan can't invent

- Satan is like Morgoth
  - Satan can remix
  - But Satan can't invent

* A person has 2 bodies

* The objective is to die in this life
Attachment to the material realm is what we wish to shed.
By shedding all spiritual attachment - and we can practice this
by detaching things from soul - which is
partially spirit (or somewhere between spirit
and material).

* Do not abort what is good

* Try to do some Pen.el today
I have intense brain-fog - stuffy head - sinuses blocked.

* I should be designing a system of being able to rigorously design things - anything
- https://interiorai.com/

* 
- temporal coherence

* Can I get Melee?
Maybe, but only if I can get back on my feet.

* Yeah, my life sucks a lot
I could, technically, have Melee, if I had a job, that is.
I should really keep faith though.

* By far the most important thing right now is to get myself a job

* For a while, at least, I am going to have to focus on more emacs, haskell, etc.
Develop a new skill.

* If I want Melee then I need a job
That's probably the most important thing.

* Doe
Snape's patronus.

I've said it before that Melee walking down the hill looking at me is my patronus.

* The only real way forward is to get myself a job, etc. (if I want money)
And just live out an uninspired life.
But I would have Melee.

* Ask Melee what she likes and then try to create it
- Ask her what her favourite things are
  - But it's easiest to do this with examples; and also for practice
    - By making things for myself
      - Recreate things
      - It's sad that having a 3d printer, say, is so prized
        - Material things... sigh

Also, I specialise not in material things, but imaginary things.

* I should be upgrading my linux operating system
I do actually need an operating system like guix or nixos.
But it should be popular like macos.

* I should be trying to understand and construct a virtual house of sorts

* I should remain faithful to Jesus
It's possible that when I heard my name called it was in fact a good spirit; or even the Holy Spirit - I do not know.
I did not feel fearful in that situation, though.
Though I had sinned.
Anyway, it's possible that the Holy Spirit is going to use me again and I need to be prepared.
So I need to remain faithful, and wait for the next instructions.

* I just have to wait for Melee if I want her, like I did with Jesus
I know that for certain.

* Imagine
- Jesus dying for the sins of the world.
- Swearing to Jesus that you'll do what you can to honor the sacrifice He made, to help spread the blood of Jesus and His message.
- How I have been forgiven and spiritually redeemed.

* I'm absolutely in the spiritual body of Jesus now!

* A spiritual body that worships God in spirit and truth
https://youtu.be/3GJ52UE5K-w?t=1062

This is my church.

* Repentance
- It's not just repentance
  - There is a purpose to repentance

The objective is to become the ideal form - the perfect man.
To do so, must clothe oneself with Christ.
However, you can't become clothed without being washed first.
A person can achieve this.

* LOL Lupin and Tonks
That's like the age difference of me and Melee.
Well theirs is 13 years.
It would be 16 years for me and Melee if it becomes a thing.
With Nellie it's 11 years.
I find this hard to believe.
It's a big age-difference.
But age shouldn't be the main reason why a person chooses or doesn't choose.

** I think of it this way
Now that a person is saved, they

* This is cool
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_of_resurrection

* I have to become the vision I saw of myself
The guy in the colourful formal shirt.

* Do I really want Melee?
I guess meeting Nellie today was a test.
Also seeing that girl at Nova was a test.
- She looked like Melee.

---

I'm faithful to Melee until my next attempt.

Yes, I want Melee.
But what is the way to get there?
The way, is to be extremely persistent.
The goal of Reuben and their family may be to frustrate me to the point where I finally break and they say 'aha, see'.
They have succeeded finally at that.
But the next thing they may do is make it so any future attempt to contact her.

* It's extremely important that I continue to remain Holy with regards to using my terminal environment and not placing trust in AI

* I need to make a semi-static user-interface
That is important.

OK, so what is the best way to ensure that under the hood I can still
intelligibly program the prompting pipeline when it comes to designing a
semi-real/static-semi-imaginary user-interface.

Well haskell monads are essential, obviously.

* Real worship
#+BEGIN_SRC text -n :async :results verbatim code
  Jesus laid out what real true worship is, first it's to worship God in spirit
  and truth. That means you understand who God is and all about the Godhead. So
  real worship is more than singing songs, real worship involves what Romans
  says; “your body as a living sacrifice.”
#+END_SRC

I would go so far as to say that worship fundamentally is nothing to do with
singing songs, and singing itself is one out of infinitely many vastly different
ways to express oneself.

Singing songs is different from singing, too.

Song in the pure sense may be produced vocally or subconsciously.

Songs generally as they are manufactured often to not capture the magic

* Get back into prompt engineering - this is very important for me to be doing

* All I need to do is work hard for Melee again
Make something epic for her.

figgy009

* I must actually get *good* at Clojure - That's important

* I have to stick within an ecosystem
And one that is futureproof - it needs to be a blockchain.
Blockchain is futureproof because it's monetisable with guarantees.

* What type of code is *worth* writing?

* I have to set up a thing for helping Melee do her art and AI stuff together
Keep in mind her mum was literally suggesting Melee becomes a truck driver.
Her mum must be crazy.

* It's really important to remain conscious and continue to improve my knowledge of programming languages
Not only programming languages but crypto!

* I'm going to marry Melee
Stay positive!
Everything goes better when I am positive about this, and I do not sin.

Even Melee's name is a syzygy of my own name.
Shane Mulligan
Ireland Grace

* I'm not going to put Jesus to shame
I'm going to act like a person who has been saved.

* When I feel Melee in my heart push on me, I need to remember that she is part of me and remember to be faithful to her
In much the same way as with Jesus.
I have to be faithful to both Jesus and Melee.

* With regards to Melee; I can't let the situation affect all other parts of my life, even though she is intrinsic
I believe I have married Melee already.
She's with me all the time in everything I do.
So now I can focus on job, etc.

* It's very important that I learn to stand in the river of fire

* I will not allow sin to reenter my life
I must remain faithful to God.
This I will do.

* It's really important to start learning technology properly
The function list things are very important to set up.

* It's quite important to lean the most abstract code management stuff possible
Code management is more important than cloud management or CICD.
Because I can manage lighter things, and more of them.

* I could treat the entire world as my dream

* I need to do some inference with prolog
Can I design something to work on EEGs?
- Visualisation.
- Biomarkers.

I should make a terminal user interface for it.

* I want Melee

* I *could* go back into university research
But that would further increase my student loan.

* Don't allow myself to become too slow at programming
Although, it's very much worthwhile to be thinking in Haskell.
I should be aiming for that.

** Ultimately, DSLs are pointless compared to thinking in Haskell
Unless the DSLs enable me to express things that solve problems which would be
too difficult to express and solve in Haskell.

* It's really important to learn powerful new programming languages
That will help me with building whatever the next emacs is for me.

* I can get Melee if I get a job, etc.
If I'm determined, I can get Melee despite the discrimination.
It's very hard to stop a person who dedicates their life to something.
I'm going to marry Melee one day.

But I need to also focus on building highly abstract software for the AGI future.

* I need to be able to build for myself decision trees which can be run-rerun, while overloading predicates using scope/environmental hyperparameters
For managing my glossary.

i.e. I need dynamic predicate trees.

The tree must fold/flatten.

It must be a predicate tree and not a predicate list.

* Prove myself as a programmer
** Prove myself as a polyglot programmer

- golang
- rust

** Who would always have work
- TypeScript / Web development

** Who can hold a job
- Complete a degree

* It's really important to move into languages which are more powerful
Asides from that I should be improving my life management, learning skills etc. with emacs.

* All I need is to want a girl a lot - that's my credentials
To want a particular girl and to want to take care of her etc.
That's the main credentials I need.
That obliterates and bullshit to do with inappropriateness.

* Soft-serve is an example of a really amazing TUI tool

* GitHub actions
https://fusectore.dev/2022/09/25/github-actions-pitfalls.html

* But it's so painful going through the go tutorial
https://gobyexample.com/

** As I do this, I must be using emacs to organise knowledge

* What's better? Rust or golang? I'd much prefer programming in rust.

* Just keep on climbing the emacs ladder for the time being
Transients are just too powerful.

* It's super important that I have the hardware to continue building Pen.el, as it is growing in size

* I am going for a small and minimal text-based operating system within Pen

* Remember to keep the unix philosopy going strong
I should make little widgets for the various bubbletea widgets.
Make one now.

* I do all programming languages and stuff so what then?

* I can probably also get a job as a regular developer
Ensure that Rust and Golang work well inside Pen.
Do this so I can get a job simply writing it.

** Rust? - Sure

** Golang? - Sure

** TypeScript - No
I would simply need to get into TypeScript or something.
I actually can do that.
But I would want to do it through Pen.
So I would simply pick a small TypeScript project, much like my other ones.
Or rather, have one TypeScript project in Pen.
What would I use TypeScript for?

* I must stand on top in righteousness
That is what I must do.
Right now I have to be standing.
Keep my eyes on Jesus, and stand in righteousness.
Defeat sin.

* I should stop going off on random tangents through unneccessarily adding to Jesus' words
I need to be continually proud of my own testimony.
And I should be.
Only write down what I believe, and then move ahead.
When I write what I don't believe, I am no longer proud of my testimony.
I should only write what I believe to be absolutely true.
And I must keep in mind what I believe to be true.
Remember and do not forget the experience that God gave me.
Be sincere in all I do.

* I should also blog about all the clojure things I do and make
I have to demonstrate progression to advanced super levels of practical Clojure.
- Understanding projects
- Building an extremely amazing IDE in Pen

* I really just need to try and create something
That's what good developers are able to do; create awesome things for other people.
That's how to get a job.

* I need to read Jesus' words in order to capture the sentiment of His words within my mind
The sentiment of the words is also very important.

* I must continue with Pen and the prompting pipeline
All of that is very important to be working on.
Go hard at it!

* I must do more with regards to getting a job
It's very important for me to do so.
I should be trying to get a Clojure job.

* The reason I don't have a job is because I program in 'esoteric' languages
I could easily get a job if I only did TypeScript.
But also I am going for:
- DevOps job, etc.

I should be perfectly capable.

* It's really important to focus on Clojure in order to make for myself a skillset that I can use to get a job
I have to become very proficient at Clojure.
This is important.
But that means a lot of boring investement.
But if I want Melee, I have to do that.

* Pen has pretty bad memory leakage
It's not a pretty picture.
The prompting pipeline should really not be used for everything.
I really need to make Pen more efficient.
I need a vastly more efficient pipeline.

* Ah, I get it
I don't think there is anything wrong with dating Melee because it's natural attraction.
It's something natural that has been made into an offense by picking on
minorities (those people that fall into a situation in the extremities, such
as an unmarried person).
That placement is often involuntary though, not voluntary.
And even if it's simply a result of being willfully 'left behind' (or opting
out of the normal dating/family pattern), even by doing so willfully it is a
natural response, and the discrimination comes from picking on people who have
that natural pattern.
In all liklihood, once married, that person will continue on through life
normally.

* It's important to get good at Clojure first - then Haskell
I've been saying that for years though.

But if I want to get rich, solidity.

* Possibly the reason why there's so much discrimination

I guess it's a bit weird for some people.
The age difference doesn't bother me in the slightest but it may be unsettling for normies.

Why the discrimination is absurd:
- Melee likes me
  - Empirical social norms are incorrect / extremely false in this situation

Why a relationship would be unsettling to normies:
- Melee's friend Ellie's mum is my age
- The people protesting probably come from condensed-generation families; and will naturally go on to have multiple marriages
  - Marry and have children young; have great-grandparents that are still alive

* How to capture the magic?
The first problem is this.

** How do I have a relationship when there is so much discrimination?

* I need to become an expert at generating and organising algebraicly prompt functions

* I do not want to abandon God or have my light body destroyed by sin
Neither sould I assume that's what it means to not be able to light myself up like a candlestick.

* It's imperative to design AI prompting stuff for Melee

* Promptbase is made with firebase
firebaseapp

* I need a new medium for doing prompt engineering
It has to be datomic / datahike.
This is important, actually.
Every step of the prompting pipeline should be memoised.
I have to combine dynamic programming with prompting.
Therefore, computations should be done lazily and on the database.
I should make a query and the generation should write on the database.

* I want Melee Dowle
I can definitely get Melee.
If she's 18 it's all good.                                               
Asking her to marry me simply came as a shock to her; that's all.
It's also other stuff.

* All I need to do is continue 'using' language models, etc.
- Improve with designing languages

* I have to prove myself with regards to real programming
Imaginary programming is fun and cool.
But if I do that then I also need to prove myself with being a master of real programming.

Do this with Clojure first.
Build some things.

* I must always do the imaginary interviewing before I do a generic interview from now on

* Why do they think I'm a bad person?
The Dowles.
It's fricking annoying.

* I write software in Clojure
Why do I do that?
Because it's sane.

* Continue building Pen stuff
Investing in Pen is a great idea.
Money is also important, though.

* As I am building I need to ensure that Pen is relevant to some type of job
What is that job type?

* I have to ensure that my emacs is good for doing devops stuff

* I have to hold to it, what I said to Melee
I fucking promised her.
And she didn't say no.

* Something like generating a pickup line should not be a thing I have to design anything to do
Rather, I should simply specify what I want from the language model.
As I'm working, things like pickup line prompt functions should be generated.

* It's really important to focus on

* I can 100% get Melee
But after I marry her it becomes about what happens next.
Will I marry her?
If I'm persistent, yes.

** If I crash and burn then not only will I not get Melee, I will turn into a loser
I have to continually assert that it's fine to be with Melee and that it's just
discrimination.

And fight for Melee.

That is literally it.

* I don't know how I'm supposed to go on with discrimination in every part of my life

* It's actually the case that age differences do not matter at all in relationships
It's just a social rule.
It devestates relationships etc.
Complete insanity.

With regards to Melee, what has happened has been discrimination.
I have been very badly treated by her family.
If I let that get to me, I'll lose power to her family.
To them, it's about domination and manipulation. Because that's what they have done, it's fair to say that's what they do generally.
Should I?

* I don't know about functional programming

* I have to focus on Pen.el again for a while and build my chatbots, etc.
But I really *do* need

* I can do far more with Pen.el
I can.
Just keep building.

- Over time I need to solve the problems of
  - Building a store for things I create
  - I should sell metaverse objects

* Why do I want Melee?
Because I like her.
Why do I like her?

One of my subconscious reasons may be that
she's [maybe not easily] but potentially is
easily impressed with a failure such as me.

And perhaps I need to sort out my life before
trying for a girl.

* TODO Building the Khala project is a worthwhile project
Try to create a prompt store.

* Perhaps I should be memorising lots of Clojure functions, and try to get a Clojure job
#+BEGIN_SRC clojure -n :i clj :async :results verbatim code
  (defn pair-consecutive
    "Group together pairs of consecutive elements in a list"
    [list]
    (partition 2 2 [1 2 3 4 5 6]))
#+END_SRC

Or reading a tonne of Clojure stack overflow,
or something, simply learning.

That might be worthwhile.

** I also have to be reviewing functions

* I can't get a job but I don't have what I need to live

* Security
This is probably what everyone is looking for.

** Melee wants security
- She probably wants someone who *can* take care of her.
- But Melee has her family for the moment, so that is reassuring.

** I want security
- I want someone who won't leave me, who I can love.

* I want to be able to make a website for generating money from prompts

* I have to work really fucking hard for the Melee

* I should start selling prompts on promptbase; Why not?

* All I truly need to do is remain on top of it
- And sane

** How to be on top of it?
- I need to be able to make useful and interesting things
- I need to be utilising libraries of useful functions so that I do not need to rely so heavily on language models
  - I need to making awesome software with proper knowledge of programming languages
  - So continue applying my language model stuff to learning Clojure, for example.

* Programming is actually not all about increasing abstraction
This is with regard to functions that are:
- used popularly
- reliable
- stabel
- have longetivity

Functions may come from application libraries that become obsoleted.

It's actually not all about abstraction, but function longetivity.
How long is a function's lifetime?

What I mean by this is that a function eventually stops being useful when the
APIs etc. which it relies on disconnect themselves.

Or when the plug is pulled on certain network nodes, IP addresses or countries.

Or when users are banned.

Therefore, functions have lifetimes.
Even prompt functions and Human language have lifetimes.
Which functions have a very long lifetime?

* I must stop writing emacs lisp so much and concentrate on Clojure, etc.
For the sake of my life, and Melee's life.
Do what I can.

* I have to work very hard to get a job etc.
Or to start making money from promptbase.
Yes, promptbase, and my own prompt shop is the way.
My own prompt shop is absolutely the way forward, ultimately.
That's what I must be working towards.

* I really need to be working on my prompt engineering software
https://promptbase.com/sell

Then I should most certainly create a better promptbase.

* I need to set up a prompt engineering shop website
This is absolutely what I should do.
So work on Khala.

* It's important for me to become strong somehow
How do I get myself a job?
By playing the game.
I must start playing the game again.
What does that mean?
I must be able to provably develop software.
I don't have to completely give up on emacs.

But I have to be able to demonstrate that:
- I can write relevant software
- I can work professionally
- I can communicate effectively
- I can complete work

* Pathfinding with GPT-3
https://jacobbrazeal.wordpress.com/2022/09/23/gpt-3-can-find-paths-up-to-7-nodes-long-in-random-graphs/

* I need to start looking for a job again
This means I need to be ready for Clojure jobs.
I need to go very hard on Clojure if I want a job in that area.

* I'm currently feeling down because I feel useless
I'm not useless.

I should probably not be seeking an exact match for the job I want, if I want
any type of job.

At this stage, I'm desperate, because of Melee.

* I need to make something for Melee so she can make her own money from her art
Then just get some regular type of job.
That's why the TracMap job would've been good, actually.

* I need to take some courses if I want the type of job I want
This is to prove that I am qualified.

Start doing this immediately, I guess.
What type of job do I want?
I actually want *no* job.
I want to work for myself.

* I should probably train myself to write better commit messages, to help myself

* I could start using git commit messages to actually help me to understand my evolving khala code

* I'm not going to be doing clojurescript
No, rather I will be doing blockchain programming in the future.
Not websites either.

Not javascript or typescript.

I'd rather do python and tensorflow than javascript and typescript.

* It's really important that I design my mechanism for designing things
Probably should base it on datomic.
I should eagerly pursue that.

* Depression is hitting me hard out of nowhere

* Consider my immunity may be lower because of the vaccines

* I don't know why I feel mentally unwell, but I do

* I love Melee
I do.
But I also need to get a job, etc.

* In some sense I need to forgo everything and focus on Pen.el

* Continue learning Haskell
It's absolutely essential to be writing Haskell.
To do AGI stuff in Haskell, prolog, etc.
But a better language may come along.
I still need to be making parsers.

* I should really use code-generation in my pen pipeline to convert my functions to external scripts which do not even use elisp

* I must continue to be able to organise my life
https://lookingglassfactory.com/

I must get better at doing this.
I have brains to design, architect, imagine.
All I need now is money.

* I have to simply become a stronger person
That's the main thing I need to do.
No money is such a constraint.
But without a win, I wont get Melee.

* It's quite important to be able to do things like diff entire trees of files
For such purposes as:
- Diffing mind-maps

I need to be able to perform such operations on trees.

* If Melee doesn't want me then I'm done
Regardless, I have to now sort out my life, properly.
I need a job, almost of any kind, really.
Tomorrow I should do some more job applications.

- University first

* It's really important that I get a job soon
This is absurd.
Just get anything?
Or do I prepare to move to some other place for a job?
I can try to get something here, I guess.
Living in Mosgiel might have been the best thing to do.
To be close to Melee?
But she'd be studying in Dunedin.
And most likely want to flat in Dunedin, too.

* I must improve my home-economics skills immediately
Max out home economics until I master the full process.

- Food supplies.
- Recipes.
- Cooking.

This is very important.

* I have to get better at using technology

* If I do all my supermarket shopping online then I'll get recommendations, etc.
It will make life easier.

* It's become apparent that I need to be able to manage more than one email, but collect them all together under one somehow
This is because the new-world website is broken for my email.

* It's expected that I have a job, etc.
https://www.quora.com/Why-were-large-age-gaps-in-relationships-so-common-in-the-1800s-and-early-1900s?share=1

In the period c. 1890–1914 a gap of about ten years was often
recommended in the middle classes.

It meant that the man would already be
established in his career and able to provide
a comfortable household with a living-in
servant or two.

He was expected to be ‘worldy wise’ and his
young wife was supposed to be sufficiently
mature to be ‘ladylike’ and run the household.

** 10 years I think is a very good normal, in my opinion, for a long-term relationship
This is really important, actually.

I have to be able to take care of myself.
That's the main thing.

** For me and Melee, though, it would be 16 years
I mean, I really do need to be established.

I have to hope and pray that my crypto does well, for starters.
But I most certainly need work.

* I need to continue improving at my Clojure
And actually become good at it.

* If I want to get a software job, or any job for that matter
I need to 'fit in' to the stereotypical 'profile'.
- Use the tooling that everyone expects
- Probably have standard (or as many as possible) qualifications
- Be able to pass some kind of interview that screens against anomalies
 
That's just the state of the world.

* The difference between guys my age and guys Melee's age is they will have friends supporting them in pursuing girls

* It's quite important to learn things such as NixOS, Guix, k8s or AWS for the long-term
I need a long-term OS.

* It's important to be able to build applications like calibre inside emacs
To have that skill is quite important.
Besides, if I don't do this then there will be even more to learn in the future.

* To make ketchup
** Ingredients
- Tomato
- Sugar
- Salt
- Spices
- Vinegar

* I have to switch focus back to emacs for a while
Make some cool stuff.

* This is why I like Melee
https://www.bible.com/bible/compare/1PE.3.3-4

* I'm not mentally strong enough yet, coming out of sickness, to engage with people

* It's important to stop reliving the past
It's all about living in the present and the future, in my opinion.

That's difficult for me.

For example, if I were living in the present then I'd be:
- constructing new stories.
- learning significantly new skills
  - cooking, for example

* If I want Melee then I
a) Should learn to make some decent meals
b) Get a job
c) Improve organisation
   - AI decision-making

Those are the two most important things, I think.

And out of the two, 'get a job' is the most important.

* What is attractive/beautiful?
- The smallness and cuteness of something 
  - Like a tiny christmas present decoration
    - Or a little red box with a gold ribbon containing a chocolate

* I should really be committing to memory haskell functions
Rather than my own shell scripts.
It would yield lasting returns to do so.

But that means implementing such functions myself.
And it would take a lot of work.

** I could do the same with racket, actually
But it would be increasingly difficult to get a job writing it.

** Clojure would be worthwhile

* What I should be aiming for is to acquire a house, I guess
But how?
What is the way?
I should probably go the way of crypto first.
The house needs to be a subset of the crypto, where the crypto can also pay
for maintenance.

* Hearing from God
https://biblehub.com/kjv/1_samuel/3.htm

In those days there was no open vision, and the word of the LORD was precious.

* I don't give a fuck about marriage statistics
Most marriages probably end in adultery anyway, because they may not be formed
properly from the beginning - on truth and faithfulness.

Almost 50 percent of all marriages in the United States will end in divorce or
separation.

In New Zealand, 42% of marriages end in divorce.

On top of this, few people even choose marriage.
In which case, adultery is considered part of normal lifestyle.

The general marriage rate in 2021 was 7.7 per 1,000 people aged 16 years and
over who are not married or in a civil union.

Therefore, the case can't be made against marriage; I'm simply bolstering an
otherwise dwindling statistic, and marriage as a concept can be destroyed by
continuing to villify minorities.

* I'm never going to stop working on Pen.el
It's Melee's.

* Spend time organising myself

* What I could demonstrate is that I can manage life with my computer
That is a massively great thing.

Learn to do this.

** Medical
** Home economics
** Mortgage
** Holidays
** Family

* When did I buy the scarlet robe?

* If I want Melee then I have to never give up and go all-out continually
And avoid jail.

* Common Lisp
** GTK-4 -- this is kinda cool actually
https://github.com/bohonghuang/cl-gtk4

* I need to continue developing

* I want an asperger's assessment
I optimally want to find out if I have it or not.
Even to find out if I *do not* have it, that would be very satisfactory for me.

* It's *possible* but far from certain that I can marry Melee
Firstly, I will need to get a job, etc.

* I have to become more focused on Pen.el
It's important to turn it into something.

* I should be building art prompting tools

* Stable diffusion
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xbxe-x6wvRw

* I want Melee

* I have to use Pen.el to learn more powerful systems
- And long-term tech such as nixos

* Living water
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_of_Life_(Christianity)

* Consider what it would be lie to have a life with Melee somewhere like Vanuatu
- Remember the entirely different world that it was

Does she even want to go to uni?
I should show her an alternative at the least.

* I have to do what noone else can do
Write to Melee using Pen.el.
Show her what noone else can give her.

* This is awesome
In the system of Valentinus, the seven heavens, and even the region above them, were
regarded as but the lowest and last stage of the exercise of creative power. Above them was
the Pleroma, where were exhibited the first manifestations of the evolution of subordinate
existence from the great First Principle. 

* If I do go back to the Father early
I will supplicate for people.
In the name of love and faithfulness, I'll supplicate for the people who truly love and are faithful.

* I do actually need to immitate Jesus for Jesus' sake
To help him with his ministry.
Jesus certainly came first.

* I person must become spiritually true and continue to learn into what is true

* pneumatology
** This is interesting
The Holy Spirit comes out of the Pleroma, in the name of Christ.
That's why it's important to call out to the Holy Spirit with the name of Jesus.

* It's really important to not despair
- Continue working
- I should not give up with Pen.el
- Like the Spelt girl told me, I should not give up with my job; I want to take care of Melee

* Melee is
- My daffodil
- My happiness
- My aeon
- My ephemeral
- My syzygy
- My world
- My rest
- Part of my truth
- Part of my grace
- My heaven on Earth, modelled after the eternal realm

* I need grace from Melee
That would literally be the outcome of a lifetime.
Meet her in court and then receive grace.

** At the same time, they wont be able to detain me
According to Gospel of Philip.

* Stay away from vape. I feel withdrawals
It doesn't feel good.

* It's important to get more abstract fast re: my operating system and relying on language models to generate the entire interface

* What I really want is to add imaginary parsing primitives to something like megaparsack, or to parsec, rather than create everything from scratch
** [#A] megaparsack
https://docs.racket-lang.org/megaparsack/differences-from-parsack.html
https://docs.racket-lang.org/megaparsack/parsing-basics.html

All parsers are monads in megaparsack.

Perhaps I *should* be using this.

Yeah, learn megaparsack.

racket is the next step before haskell, I think.

Monads keep all programming units within a context.

** Parsec

* I am sure that I would find it very rewarding to be writing applications in Haskell

* It's imporant to be building parsers
Is racket good for parsing?

* Pen.el has to remain focused on learning itself

* Get better at company-mode, actually
The TabNine plugin is great, and improving.

* Pen.el has to help with learning, decision-making etc.
It has to.

* I still must continue trying, right into the realms of insanity

* I must continue building with Pen.el

* In order to escape insanity, I need
- to be programming in a language which escapes the insanity
- with tools that can truly wrangle with all sorts of languages.

* Continue to master emacs
It's what is going to keep me sane in the future.

* My computing must continue to get more abstract

* It's important to continue upgrading Pen.el right into the future

* Technically, all I need is a job

* The angel hastened along the path as though seeing sunlight for the first time in an aeon

Light of the lights of the Treasury of the Light; and I have brought the wine
and the blood out of the region of Barbēlō.  And after a little while my father
sent me the holy spirit in the type of a dove.  "And the fire, the water and
the wine are for the purification of all the sins of the world. The blood on
the other hand was for a sign unto me because of the human body which I
received in the region of Barbēlō, the great power of the invisible god. The
breath on the other hand advanceth towards all souls and leadeth them unto the

And Jesus, the compassionate, answered and said unto Mary: "Mary, thou blessed

openness, thou, whose heart is raised to the kingdom of heaven more than all
thy brethren."

https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/mistic/pistis_sophia/ps022.htm

For this cause it hath said also: 'Ye shall then know not of what the lord
Sabaōth will do '; that is, none of the rulers will know what thou wilt do from
now on,--for they are 'Egypt,' because they are matter. The power then which
was in Isaiah, prophesied concerning thee aforetime, saying: 'From now on ye
shall then know not what the lord Sabaōth will do.' Because of the light-power
which thou didst receive from Sabaōth, the Good, who is in the region of the
Right, and which is in thy material body to-day, for this cause then, my Lord
Jesus, thou hast said unto us: 'Who hath ears to hear, let him hear,'--in order
that thou mightest know whose heart is ardently raised to the kingdom of
heaven."

he turneth again and sinneth, ye are to continue again the second time up to
the third time. If he still sinneth, ye shall not continue to give him, for
those three mysteries will be witnesses unto him for his last repentance. And
amēn, I say unto you: He who shall give that man anew mysteries of the second
space or of the third, is guilty of a great condemnation. But let him be for
you as a transgressor and as a stumbling-block.

"Amēn, I say unto you: The soul of that man cannot be cast back into the world
|271. from this moment onwards; but his habitation is in the midst of the jaws
of the dragon of the outer darkness, the region of howling and grinding of
teeth. And at the dissolution of the world his soul will be frozen up [?] and
perish in the violent cold and exceedingly violent fire and will be
non-existent eternally.

"Even if he yet again turneth and renounceth the whole world and all its cares
and all its sins, and he is in great citizenship and great repentance, no
mystery can receive from him his repentance; nor can it hearken unto him, to
have mercy

* At this stage I just need a job

* One of the best things I can be doing right now is developing this operating system
But I have to develop it to do thinking with it.
To improve my ability to think and reason.

* It's a good idea to learn to build TUIs
- Not just emacs TUIs.
  - rust/go/python-based

* I want Melee so badly
OK, so I need to be able to provide for her.
That is really important.

** Money is the main thing, to be honest

** With regards to helping her with Art and AI, I am doing OK currently
- I need to not allow myself to become detached from her

*** Build all my own prompting stuff
- Design the system well
  - Datomic, etc.

* Melee closure
- I could continue to pull various prompting APIs into Pen.el.
- I should be building Pen and building a mind map with prompting stuff
  - Build an org-brain for Melee with links etc. that I discover

* Literally, all this crazy extra syntax to manage memory, etc. in programming languages is an utter waste of time
Rather, the language I should be learning should be managing things like:
- Prompt injection
- Decoherence
- Truth

* With learning Haskell, I might have to simply build lots of things to learn it properly

* It's really important to continue with my Haskell learning
https://wiki.haskell.org/Monads_as_containers

Technically, I should be so good at my Haskell that the LLMs shouldn't bother me.

* I need the database because I must be making thinking tools right now
Protect myself against insanity by:
- Using emacs and thinking tools I personally understand to manage my own life
- Make a career for myself
- Start a business which generates money so I don't need to work so hard

* I have to build things for supporting Melee's art inside of Pen
- The database is important
- The website to go along with the database

* Nothing is going to work unless I get a job soon

* I have to get grounded and in reality if I want the job of taking care of Melee

* Try to focus
- Focus on work
- Learn haskell properly
- Learn ethereum properly
- Get a job

* I have to be prepared for dating Melee
- Clean my teeth; Go to dentist. Seriously. Don't screw up my basics
- I have to 
- Job, for starters
- Stoic. Emotionally stable
- Work stabilised
  - Emacs extension stabilised
- Able to manage life
- Able to separate work from fun/life

* The icon for the Melee prompting mode should be a strawberry

* What is Melee's birthday and year?
OK, so she is 18 now.
It must be 2004. That's actually OK.
May 2, 2004.

* It's important to be building the actual file systems, etc.
I have to aim to build my own prompting store, and crypto.

* Simply continue learning emacs as well as I can, while also applying it to Haskell
This is very important.
Build up my learning tools.
That's what's most important.

* It's really important right now to simply get myself some kind of job

* Keep focused on making my Ethereum coin

* Keep learning useful terminal things
Learn tools that are incredibly useful, robust and easy to integrate.
Which do not change.

- fpvd
- broot

But I *do* need to continually learn the tools properly.

* VSCode solidity support looks very good
https://www.npmjs.com/package/solidity-language-server

* I can get Melee
But I have to work really hard.
She's my destiny though.

* I should definitely try to become good at a programming language such as solidity
It's a good idea to make my own coin and have an ICO.

* I just need all the components to start doing some development

* The idea is to set up my own IDE because if I am building inside crypto then I will already need my own highly-optimised and customised IDE

* I think what is going to happen is this
AI will make everyone go crazy.

* Wouldn't it be nice to have a caching http proxy
I should probably set one up.

* It's really important to be managing everything from Pen
It's essential, actually.

* It's really important to apply my AI stuff to learning a programming language
- A really hard one, or many

* I should design software for Melee to use
What types of subshells?

* I still need to focus my programming on a language ecosystem such as Haskell
But also a Lisp such as CL - something hacky and efficient.
Also Clojure. Why Clojure? Because it's very nice.
It's important to continue using a lisp.
But also arbitrary/flexible language design with Racket.

* Just continue to upgrade Pen as time goes on

* *Don't* keep the Rust artifacts *inside* Pen.

* The most important thing is that Pen.el becomes a control panel for managing my life

* Important habits
- Be actually writing Haskell code
- When I read, read properly (ensure I understand each word before progressing, and have made a mental note)

* Important things to learn (and do)
- Monadic parsers
  - Begin iParsec
- Solidity
  - Set up blockchain

* It's really important to focus on more abstract parsers, etc.
- NL parsers
  - Therefore, it's important to understand monadic parsers
    - Do much more work on that

* Try to focus on heavenly things
- Lasting things

** Then I wont
- Go crazy
- Lose everything

* It's really important to be learning abstractions (particularly Haskell abstractions)
- Monad and do

* I must set up my Ethereum development environment before starting a new job

* I have to get myself a job working somewhere
I should really be able to do any job.

* Whatever I do, I must be able to abstract away the entire world with what I'm doing
If I'm not doing that then I'm failing.
And in some sense I am failing at that.

* Perhaps it's worth learning Rust?
https://emacs-lsp.github.io/lsp-mode/page/lsp-rust-analyzer/

I'm just thinking that it might be the new python.
It could also be the new Go.
It would probably be better for writing TUI applications than even python.

** I might even be able to get a job writing Rust

* Long-term, the language I am using matters
That is because I must continue to abstract things away or I will not be able
to understand anything in the future.

** Haskell is a top priority

** Racket is also a high priority

* The difference between my environment and other people's is mine does not change unless I want it to
The IDE is also the project.
Whatever I make will be based on Pen.

* It's really important to be programming powerfully from within Pen
Learn as many emacs abstractions as I can, and harness them.
The more abstractions I learn, the better.

* If I am to build a subshell just for Melee, what would it need to do?
For example, what completion backends.
It would be an entirely creative art-producing version of emacs.
But what would it connect to as a backend?

* It's important to begin creating content with my programming and selling it online

* fpvd must become an integral part of Pen and emacs
But to have that, I need control over filesystems.
It's very important that I set up many different filesystems.

* Broot is a seriously epic program
I wish I knew how to build it.
I should use Pen to hack on it!

* I realise that I need neural versions of grep, etc.
At that stage I will probably prefix all such tools with 'n' and simply start using them.
But I need to be building learning tools for myself.

* Pen.el is going to get very complex

* I have to learn to build large systems in Clojure

* How do people collaborate on software in the future?
If it's through blockchain, then perhaps I should be mastering that domain as well.

* I must retain good perspective
- Work hard
  - A job is important
  - Pen.el is important; Arguably moreso
    - Since it's also the foundation for my other programming; Clojure, for example

* I guess that imaginary programming is the sign of a great programmer
This is because you need a solid foundation to begin believing imaginary programming can be a productive enterprise.

* I wrote tapestry of Truth Appendix on May 2 (Her birthday); Or at least that's when I appendicised it
Bookends of the book of life much?

* Melee Dowle is my girl and I am going to marry her

* Melee is such a fucking beautiful person

* I'm going to marry Melee; I know it
But I have to work much harder.
I have to focus much more.

* I have to become a master of fiction and reality

* It's important to be proactive with regard to my writing and programming
That is because there are bad people out here who I may be compared to, and I need evidence to show that I'm a good person.
What I mean is, if I do not have a voice then people would not know the real me.
But people can know the real me by seeing my writing.

* The reason why Haskell is important is typeclasses
Any language which can describe its own functions usefully is a useful language in the future.

* It's important to master company-mode
I should be able to make emacs-based TUI applications that autocomplete in
different ways.

Say, simply have company-tabnine wrapped up inside docker.

* I really need to be using the hackiest languages ever
- Bash, together with environment variables is very much up there.
- Emacs lisp is up there too.
- TCL/expect.
- sed.

What else is up there?
Probably racket, but in a different sense.
I don't know yet.

* Remain focused with Pen.el

* If I want, I can just become a good Clojure developer

* I personally don't see any problem with Melee, and I think I could probably date her
I just need to get on top of my work, etc.

* I need to become good at learning functions
It would be great to become good at learning Haskell functions in particular.

* Ensure that I continue:
Learning to build DSLs; I'll need many iterations of development time, so probably best to use racket (rather than use a BNF grammar).

* Future YouTube for learning
https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/the-next-chapter-for-learning-on-youtube/

I should really get with it.
Try to understand.

* At this stage I should not even tell anyone which tools I use to make what I make
Simply start producing results.
Talk about the products I make, not the tools I use.

* Honestly, the software I'm writing is all bullshit in a way. At least it's integrated
Honestly, the important most effective thing I should be doing now is staying
on top of learning Haskell well.

And perhaps integrating knowledge by making DSLs.

* I actually think that most people would probably end up sticking with some custom vscode system eventually, or something like that
And sucks to be them; They're locked in forever.

* Probably the reason (from a biology standpoint) why people marry each other is because they are on a high
I'd imagine that if people get their life together, feel comfortable about
settling down in a new house and starting a family, they are on a high.

If I ask someone to marry me then that is because I'm comfortable in doing so.

* The only way I'm going to get Melee is if I concentrate on getting a job, etc.

* There's no way I want to end in a place where I know nothing, by becoming dependent on commercial software

* I should do much more clojure
Spend lots of time on pensieve, etc.

** I should absolutely spend time becoming a master of Clojure
That is important.

* Pen
** Clojure
- cider/helm-clojure is epic!

* I should absolutely get the base systems sorted before progressing
- Rhizome/Datahike
- Pensieve
- Khala

It's essential that I do this.

* IPFS
** Asciinema
#+BEGIN_SRC text -n :async :results verbatim code
  Playing from IPFS:
  
         asciinema play dweb:/ipfs/QmNe7FsYaHc9SaDEAEXbaagAzNw9cH7YbzN4xV7jV1MCzK/ascii.cast
#+END_SRC

* TODO Continue to upkeep Pen.el
I literally only need to continue doing that.
If I can continue to upkeep Pen.el and work on it nearly every day, then I will be continually upskilling.
It's just a lot of work; That's all.

* If I simply set up a database such as datomic, that would be an epicly good thing to learn

* Become good at Clojure
If I can get really good at Clojure then I will be able to get a decent job.
But because of LLMs languages such as Haskell are ever so more important.

* When I read tough material I must try better to read while interpreting
It's not enough to read without interpreting all of the words.

That means my reading will be a lot slower, but it's worth reading things
properly - with attention to the words.

* I should improve my general clojure practical knowledge
By doing some reading of the documentation.

* I do want Pensieve, though, don't I?
Yes. It would be great to simply have directories of images generated by stable
diffusion, for example.

Or too simply provide a path to an image and have it generated on the fly, and
pass that into looking glass.

** Pensieve is important

* It's wrong to try to understand the complete codebase
- Even of Pensieve

That is because, I do not even know the complete emacs codebase, yet I still
use it.

What I need to to be iterating on a stable state.

It's broken and that is the problem; I don't know *how* broken.

* This is great
https://youtu.be/rI8tNMsozo0?t=281

* More important than getting a job is making money from prompting

* Focus on my programming again
I have to work very hard on that.
For Melee.

* I have to learn emacs thoroughly
One day I will have AGIs running my terminal.

* I have to offload more things onto the languages I am learning
Learn programming languages well.
Offload more and more of my own cognition.
Haskell is essential.
However, the programming that I do must be relevant, not arbitrary.

* Keep in mind that what I am programming now is the way I will understand the world

* It's really important for Pen.el to stay relevant

* I should be applying my NLP skills to working on original information, too
- For example, to someone's website, or a book
  - Consume original information

* Prove to Melee that I'm sane, and I asked when I was mentally clear
- do a lot of
  - ethereum
  - haskell
  - clojure
  - common lisp

* It's really important to build conversational agents and these types of interfaces for myself

* I have to become increasingly organised with my programming
- It's important to be using a database such as datomic, for sanity purposes.
- I should be relying more on a language such as common lisp for my scripting.

* It's very important to continue creating useful tools
- But I need to be solving some problem, so I can make money from my work

* Pen needs to be a system for having a conversation with my computer
I have to build conversational tools.

Pen.el has to be a system for having
conversations with LMs, whilst making progress
and learning.

Therefore I need total control over the prompt generations.
- I need to create metaversal objects and classes, who's schemas are saved to the database.

* Is it worth setting up C++ in emacs?
http://tuhdo.github.io/c-ide.html#sec-2

Who in their right mind would want to code in C++?

* Get back into creating cool stuff
e:$HOME/blog/posts/nlsu-a-repl-for-generating-code-examples.org

** Make some awesome REPLs and things for generating

* I should probably be doing most of my prompt programming inside of common lisp, to be honest
Because:
- it's faster than emacs.
- CL is more expressive than emacs lisp.

* The more abstract my programming, the better, I think
- Search multiverses; That's what I want
  - But how?
    - Using abstractions such as filesystems
    - Then software on top of that such as broot

* If I can become good at clojure then that is enough to take care of Melee, I think
But I would have to focus quite a lot on becoming good at it.

* I need to be building software for doing decision-making inside of Pen.el
This might involve making fictional debates, etc.

* It is actually important to have a tool like tabnine running inside pen
tabnine just runs so damn fast.

* When getting a job
- I need to know what the tooling is in advance

* Pen
** Is emacs even enough?
I need another similar high-yield project.

** I must not only convert images to text, but I must be able to measure the truthfulness of what I'm seeing

* If I focus on high speed emacs tools such as company, together with TabNine, say, then I will be able to make much higher-speed completion tools for LLMs in the future

* It's important for me to continue building up the Pen.el development environment

* It would be fun if in the future I simply built DSLs

* I have to build Pen in such a way that it tries to be as generative as possible

* It's important to get much stronger at my programming, quickly
But how?

More Clojure, maybe..

* I'm going to pull Pen.el into alignment
It's going to completely replace my host OS eventually.

* It's actually quite important to master more powerful programming languages
- In a useful way

* I guess that it's very important to upkeep my emacs system generally

* It's important to have a project idea and then build that project
Pen.el is my infinite project.

* The world is definitely heading towards crypto economy
https://www.tattoosai.com/

* Everything is insane
- Haskell is insane
- My interests are insane
  - Like Pen.el, say

* It's really important to be building Pen.el right now
I must continue to try to understand all of AGI through the lens of Pen.el.

* If I want Melee I have to get a job quickly

* I have to learn to make everything myself
pen:$MYGIT/mullikine/recruiter_rm/recruiter_rm.py

* I have to get myself a job if I want Melee; That's super important
- Back to reality, I guess

* I feel physically unwell now
- After what has happened with the court case
- I feel highly anxious

** But if I think of her and believe what was true, I become better
- That she's my world, etc.

But I have to not think about:
- all the lies about me
- all the bad things they might think about me
- anxiety stuff

* I told Reuben
** The facts
- I want the job of taking care of Melee.
- They haven't blocked me at all.

Remember these facts.

* I need to do more learning into ethereum

* It's important to be learning algorithms such as wave function collapse, etc. to use them on manipulating text

* Focus for a while on building languages with racket
This is to build languages for prompting.

* I have to be making my own TUIs. Not just emacs
Also, I have to be building super abstractly.
- Haskell
- Common Lisp
- Clojure + a python TUI library

Rust has amazing TUI libraries.
- https://github.com/fdehau/tui-rs

* I should be primarily extending Pen, not so much the host environment

* Be more chill
Next time, ask Melee if she has a boyfriend.

** Also, just get a job, try to integrate with society
If I can do that then I'm sorted

** Cease all activity blogging about Melee

* I should just completely drop anything romantic for the time being and focus on Haskell, etc.
It's the coolest thing I can do for the time being.

* From now on, the way to prove to an employer that they should take me
- Doesn't use psychometrics
- Based on:
  - Certificates
  - References
  - (in other words, bullshit)
- Posibly
  - GitHub metrics
  - Proof of finishing projects ?

* Whatever I do, do not do psych tests from employers again

* My goal right now should be to set up a programming environment which will take me a lot further into the future
I need mastery of emacs to do this.

* I have to get more focused with my programming

* I should write about different algorithms, and implement them so I do understand
- wave function collapse

https://github.com/ChrisPenner/wave-function-collapse

Ooh, asciinema, terminal, haskell and wavefunction collapse

* GitHub discussions functions a bit like stackoverflow
https://github.com/company-mode/company-mode/discussions/1186

* I literally just want to do this

* Right now it's quite hard for me
I have to work but I am emotionally compromised.

* Yes, I must continue improving my elisp skills
This is essential.
- pcase

** In fact, I should be making lists of functions which I have learned
And better, still, I should be creating the documentation at the same time.

*** TODO I should link these files to emacs/pen somehow
I also need to be able to quickly show the docs for them.
**** elisp
e:$HOME/learn-functions/elisp/learned.txt

ci:helpful-function

**** clojure
e:$HOME/learn-functions/clojure/learned.txt

**** racket
e:$HOME/learn-functions/racket/learned.txt

**** common lisp
e:$HOME/learn-functions/common-lisp/learned.txt

* What is this?
company-statistics-mode

* The way is to just become ridiculously focused and fluent in writing code
And to go deep into various languages and their library systems.

* Can I make advice for racket code which controls emacs?

* I have to build more cool shit, but with Haskell

* In retrospect, with regards to the DevOps job
I could have said something more like this:

#+BEGIN_SRC text -n :async :results verbatim code
  I think it's very important to have tool which everyone can use. However, it's
  also vital that the senior is on top of his work. So the guiding principle
  for me is that I automate for myself first (whether that be in documentation
  or writing a script) and automate for myself second.
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_SRC text -n :async :results verbatim code
  I think DevOps is one of the most challenging fields today. Simply because it
  not only involves tools, but requires a deep understanding of the right
  principles, processes and practices that the DevOps philosophy is bringing to
  the IT world.
  
  Tools you can learn. Easily. But, if you do not learn the principles, processes
  and practices by heart and fundamentally understand how to apply them, you end
  up being a glorified sysadmin instead of a true DevOps practitioner.
#+END_SRC

* I'm completely gone for Melee; I am. I love her

* It's important to learn to create abstractions for the sake of abstractions first before creating things

* It's extremely improtant to continue working and not let this destroy my life

* Jesus died as a perfect offering
** Hebrews 9:14
#+BEGIN_SRC text -n :async :results verbatim code
  How much more will the blood of Christ, who through the 2 eternal Spirit offered
  Himself without blemish to God, purify our conscience from dead works to serve
  the living God.
#+END_SRC

The blood of Christ purifies conscience.

* I have to keep my prompts as abstract as possible and generate as many as possible

https://promptbase.com/

Consider on promptbase, that I want to be able to generate all of the prompts
instead of categorise them.

* If it's possible to go to sleep on water then this is probably how
https://qph.cf2.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-9c58cdbb9b1525bfdb1e0123a797648b-pjlq

egr:how to go to sleep on sea water

* I have to get even stronger with my programming and focus on it soon

* I should definitely progress myself with God
Hang out with Adson.

* Do not let go of Melee

* It's going to get real when everything I program with Ethereum manipulates reality itself

* It's quite important for me to just focus on Pen.el and put Melee out of mind, for my sanity
However, in doing so I might lose Melee.

* TODO 
Make my requests very clear:
- I am not a risk
- I want to be cleared from legal guilt, based on 
- I want to be cleared of criminal offense

* I have to write down my plea
I am a pillar of society and not a criminal.
I have overstepped but I was emotionally compromised.

* Just continue working on Pen
It's the way.

* My project Pen.el has to become an augmented intelligence system that uses AGI to help people, rather than for profit

* Trial
- I want to avoid being painted as a criminal when I am not

* This is a cool project
https://www.openbible.info/labs/ai-bible-study/passage/Exod.5

* I will be on trial and I will have to defend myself

* My blog is really close to my center of consciousness
It's just a stream of consciousness.

* I need the opportunity to react to the changing landcape as new knowledge comes in, without destroying what I have built

* Business ideas:
- An AI you can chat to that simply waits around waiting for a response from you.
  - Like the guy in this video
  - https://youtu.be/Lu9dUG3_KNA?t=1490

* It's really important that I win this case, actually
It's important because I want to be able to talk to Melee again in the future

* It's important to become more focused on Haskell
This type of knowledge is useful for understanding the metaverse.

* Do I really need to give up?

* In order to fit in a person has to be less sure of themself

* It's important to get nonchalant and focused on what the employer wants
Employers want people who are chill and focused.
And they don't want to be enlightened.
People don't want to be enlightened to AI stuff.

* It's really quite important to continue integrating beyond anything anyone can imagine

* It's the second time recently that I've been told:
- They've said no, that's the end of it
  - There was no opportunity for me to speak at all

Both times, however, it's been incredibly unfair towards myself.
Clear discrimination.

** I find that to be very peculiar
It's a symmetry.

* If I want to apply for some type of job then I need to demonstrate my research on the topic in advance
- This is what I should do
  - This is certainly the way

** Then I can claim that that is what qualifies me

* Who is God?
- Did God create the universe?
  - Which God?
    - Is my Father God?
- What did I experience?
  - What was the significance of it?

* Don't cheat myself
I'm buildig something amazing.
Pen is amazing.

* Ravensdown is looking for a devops but they don't want a real devops
https://wagslane.dev/posts/no-one-does-devops/

* This is definitely true
https://herbertlui.net/dont-think-to-write-write-to-think/

* I'll become better at Haskell if I simply continue using it
It's extremely important to start writing Haskell at an abstract level soon.
Extremely important.
Do more Haskell.
Focus on learning abstract things.
I may have to build my way up to fluency.
I can always combine different languages.
I plan on combining Haskell with Common Lisp.

* I want to be nonchalant, I do
I want to be preparing for the future with my prolog, say.

* I don't need incredibly complex software
I just need all the pieces and components so I can build upwards.

** Own tools
- ESP language server
- NLSH
- Cterm

** Languages
I need Pen.el set up with the various language environments I need.
- Racket
- Prolog
- Haskell
- Clojure
- Common Lisp

** Tools
I need Pen.el set up with tools for helping me to manipulate data:
- visidata

* Focus on learning tooling - it's easier

* It's really important to continue abstracting
I need to be able to manage elaborate and complex systems with simplicity.
Therefore, I need prolog, haskell, racket, etc.
Set up all of the environments.
Also, learn the tools I need:
- visidata

* Just learn visidata well
To the best of my ability.

* Definitely set up racket lang
It would be very fun to be writing in Racket with emacs.

* I really want to set up the search engine again so I can make more efficient command line tools

* It's actually important to become someone really different

* Some people in society are certainly losing their minds
I must try to be someone who doesn't lose theirs.

* I should definitely endeavour to 

* I must begin organising code with
- Prolog
- Haskell
- Clojure

* It's important to set up the search engine again
I want instant search across everything.

* I need to ensure that I can write prolog etc.

* I now need to balance out my abstraction with something else -- becoming effective somehow
I must do this by focusing on Haskell.

* Which ecosystem am I going to invest in learning?
In all seriousness.
It really *should* be AWS probably, if I want to make lots of money.
However, that seems so incredibly wrong spiritually.
If I want to retain my own soul then I have to invest in something else:
- Haskell
- Prolog

Get very deep into Haskell and Prolog; Especially Haskell.

* Don't get stuck in the abyss of CICD terminology
I need to be developing Pen.el carefully so I can continue learning to understand.

* I really need simply a list of regex matches for relevant CICD filess, etc.

* docs
** circleci
https://circleci.com/docs/sample-config?utm_term=g_-_c__dsa_

* I should be focusing on building AGI systems
- Prolog, absolutely.

Do this because companies are going to have an extremely difficult time managing their robots, etc.
Yes, I need to set up and learn prolog, etc.

* I could continue expanding upon my CV to make it more truthful
- I use a variety of tools which you have never heard of before
  - Because I generally build my own tools
  - Because I stick to emacs
    - The oldest and best IDE for integrating things

* It's important for me to get deep into an environment which will scale
- Nix
- AWS
- Haskell

* It's extremely important to upkeep my Pen.el
- And to work on my own tools for querying the multiverse

The multiverse which is being queried is actually imaginary/lazy/latent.
Imagination which is powered by will but directed by learning from humans and constructing a model of humans.

* I should connect my caching system to a database
What database should I use for everyday stuff?
Well first I should figure out how to do basic loading of CSVs etc.
Treat a CSV as a database.

https://github.com/mithrandie/csvq

* I should be writing about my worries and concerns

* I should be allowing all of my 

* I should be writing to Melee automatically

* I should honestly be treating my emacs lisp like a serious programming language
[[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCmyMCfmUhQ][Object-Oriented Emacs Lisp with EIEIO - System Crafters Live! - YouTube]]

* Imagine in the future
- It feels like anyone can get the type of thing they want, no matter what it is
  - But the world is falling apart
  - Noone knows how to solve it
  - Machines are more intelligent than people
  - Other humans are truly gods to other humans

* It's really important for me to continue

* Continue getting much stronger at emacs

* I need a text based operating system

* It's important to continue improving my programming skills
With a direction towards Ethereum.

* It matters where I place my focus
If I really want money or whatever then I should probably just get my aws
certificate.

* Hmm. I wonder if I can use TUI tools through ssh from Pen to the Host, such as saws

* For anything that I am learning, I must be able to 'ramp up'
- It's easy to ramp up with emacs because I can continue learning and extending it.

There may be very few other pieces of software that I could do this with.

And if I wanted to, then I would need:
- Have a sterile environment
- Collect snippets

** Not really possible with
- Haskell

* Perhaps I should be like everyone else and abandon my own environment but focus on Haskell intensely to learn the language
Nah, just take it slowly.
Continue using Pen.el.
It will keep me happy and sane.

* It's absolutely essential that I spend more time learning
- racket
- haskell
  - Probing the multiverse (wand)

* Would my time be better spent learning esoteric DSLs?

* What is the best way to search databases

* If I ever lose my cognitive capacity then who would I seek out to take care of me?

* How much further could I go with setting up python?
- LSP documentation, etc.

* Things will get very holographic in the future, that is certain

* It's very important to get deep into Haskell
Because I need to be able to build anything, lazily and imaginarily.
Build anything in latent space.
Prompt for anything.

* I should probably upgrade the tf script to name by sha

* This is what a haskell program looks like
vs:$MYGIT/lazamar/haskell-docs-cli/src/Docs/CLI/Evaluate.hs

* I should actually be developing my own AGIs which have memory etc.
Trying to make metaversal life forms with the AI is the direction.

* I should not compromise with regards to working in a terminal
It's more important than getting distracted by visual stuff.

* What do I need to do in order to be able to work in the future?
I need to be able to write in:
- Monolithic, elaborate and abstract Common Lisp
  - Applications
  - Utilise monads, macros, etc.
- Monolithic, elaborate and abstract Haskell

* What is meaningful in this world?
Melee.

* What do I have to do?
Is Melee the right person?
I think so.
I hope so.

** Maybe I should give up with Melee. Should I?
What is in my imagination?
What can I make real?

* It's ranger that is still crashing Pen

* What knowledge will last a very long time?
Good question.

* OK, so what do I do
Somehow I need to follow through with everything.
Do I really love Melee?
Yes.
Do I really care about their family?
Yes.
Do I even have the means?
Not currently.
Do I love my own family? Mum and Dad?
Yes.
I should probably go with them to church tomorrow.
I want to have that memory.
Very strong in my mind.

* Yes, it's extremely important to have a working library of
- Haskell functions
- Prolog algorithms

* Just continue what I am doing
- Do more actual AI stuff
  - Like stuff I haven't invented merely myself
    - Apply algorithms, parsers, language design etc. to LLMs

* It's very important to continue with Haskell

* I will continue with Pen.el
I will have an environment that simply works.

* I do actually need to continue building Pen.el etc.
That's really important.

* It's very important to set up the database soon

* In-jokes are important
- "Weird specific thing, you had to be there"

* It's really important to
- Simply ensure I have solid work
- Consider taking care of Melee to be a good thing

* I really need to be
- Using Language Models to probe the multiverse

* It's really important that I fight to make my Haskell environment
And along the way utilise Language Models.
The more I do with Codex, for example, the more prepared I will be in the future.

* I should be making a metaverse browser
This will help me to navigate the future.
Create stories for myself.

* Practically speaking, I should be focusing on Common Lisp
That is because it's a language that will allow me to simply build.

* Consider that it's really important to get deep into common lisp

* It's really important to continue investing all my time into learning emacs well

* How can people reduce the power of LLMs?
http://www.cofault.com/2022/08/3-lisp-infinite-tower-of-meta-circular.html

* I want to completely abstract myself out to infinity

* This is how I think of myself going after Melee
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lu9dUG3_KNA&t=2121s

Black team scores 10,000 points.
Oh shit! 

* I have to ensure that I do all of my programming through Pen.el
Do my own reasoning via programming languages.
This way, even into the future, I will increase my metaverse dunamis.

** Yes, it is interesting
If I learn more Haskell, genuinely, then that is actually making me
exponentially more powerful that other humans, when applying the programming to
general reasoning.

* Macro-expansion is extremely important
I really shouldn't be using languages without macro expansion.

* If I'm genuine then I will ask later

* I should start being respectful to Melee's parents

* Just focus on learning and improving at
- Common Lisp
- Haskell
- Clojure, sure

Just be calm and keep coding.

** The stronger at programming I get, generally, the more I can rely on language models and not APIs
This is what I want.

** It's really important to be able to keep my environment nice and simple and manageable
Do not over-learn.
Never forget what I learn.

* It's important to be developing my own operating system

* I must treat my programming environment as my thinking machine
I think *through* Pen.el.
This is very important.
Ideally, I should be doing everything through Pen.el.

* I do actually need to be creating virtual life forms
I must do this.
The simulation will be reified in the future.

* I should actually just commit to an environment such as Haskell and not read from other things
Yes, the world is the aeon and I must remain set-apart.
But there is no way for me to save myself.
I need Jesus.
A person also still needs Jesus.
The second-coming is absolutely essential.

* If I can sustain my life through Pen.el then that itself is enough to be allowed a wife of my choice

* It's really important to build all software I use myself
Do this so that I can retain power.

I need Common Lisp, Haskell and Prolog kinda desperately.

* Perhaps it's a good idea to simply create a mental model of networks and systems
Then find/aggregate software solutions, try to understand what they do.

https://ngrok.com/

* It's extremely important to integrate
- knowledge

* It's quite important to have Common Lisp and Prolog down within Pen.el
This is because I actually need Common Lisp and Prolog to help me to think.
It's more important for me to develop my own automation software than to use
other peoples'.

* Pen.el is my monad of metaversal consciousness

* Pen.el has to become monadic in the philosophical sense
What I mean by that, is all of my thinking must be done from Pen.el.
And it must solicit language models constantly.
This is important.

* It's possible that the job of a programmer right now should be building into a crystalising internet
In which case, that is the opposite philosophy of Pen.el.
It's NixOS vs Pen.el.

* In some sense I need to do the job thing eventually just to 'get in the door' with regards to establishment in the metaverse

* I have to get really good at writing in common lisp, clojure and haskell
Be building and maintaining projects.

* Whatever I'm building has to grow into something epic
- It's really important to focus on understanding rather than building
  - I.e. I have to combine Haskell, Common Lisp and blockchain
  - And most certainly combine my prompt generations with a database

* I do actually want to get productive in a pragmatic language like Common Lisp

* It's really important to start developing in Common Lisp and Haskell
- Create projects
- Ensure function search, etc. is all as good as emacs lisp

* I'm either someone who is continually programming or I am someone who is doing nothing essentially
- Choose:
  - Continually programming without inhibition
  - Do essentially nothing, but fearfully conform to a life which doesn't go anywhere
    - Stare down Jenkins logs manually

* TODO Use transient in far more places

* I need to get to the point where
- I am just building software very quickly with common lisp, say.
- I am doing advanced stuff with Haskell -- applying myself to Imaginary Programmig
  - Lazy Imaginary Programming with Corecursion (generative datastructures)

* Divine Godess
Melee.

https://youtu.be/GD8TKkwd6AE?t=272

* What I should really be an export in by now:
- Managing money
- Haskell
- Cooking

** What I should not be doing:
- Some random job

I do actually hate money, though.

* It's very important to continue with Common Lisp and Haskell until the programming environments are extremely fluid
Sticking to Haskell is the way forward if I am going to continue using emacs.
Which I am.

* Do a lot of Codex + Common lisp
Yes, also continue to combine Codex with emacs.
That is a top priority.

* It's really important not only the languages I'm using, but the things I can make with them

* It's really important I get the Haskell right down
- And the common lisp
- And the prolog
- And the problog

* It's very important to continue increasing my abstraction
I must be doing most of my programming in Haskell eventually.

* If I consider my own body and mind to be treasure for the Lord then that certainly makes it easier
How?

Well, consider that if I imagine myself in a certain frame of mind (taking the
high ground) and operate in such a way there I am doing works in secret for the
Lord, then I simultaneously become wiser, create a bodily reality/experience
for the Spirit of God to dwell within and enjoy hopefully.

* What types of things will I be developing with Common Lisp?
Software applications for certain.
Imaginary Programming stuff.

* It's really important to focus on 'embeddings' etc.
- Programmatically

* Lies are in the heart
The only reason people consider them to be something to do with communication
is because of the way that consensus is so coupled with languages.
But there should be less trust in communication.
And communication (between humans) itself.

Words have power only because we decide that they do.

* I must go back to focusing on Jesus

* vim
** How to set file based on shebang line and/or extension?

* Soon, nothing will make sense

* I have to make the 2 into one
- I should become very good at this

* It's really important to become stronger at
- Prolog
- Haskell
- Common Lisp
- Problog
  - Not as important, but it might be quite useful to generate problog

And I will.

* I must become as good at Common Lisp as I am with Emacs Lisp
- That's actually really important.

* I have to always remember how Jesus saved me
My experience meeting the Holy Spirit.
The Bridal Chamber.
All of this was real.

* All Scripture, even Gnostic
[[https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Timothy+3&version=NIV][2 Timothy 3]]

#+BEGIN_SRC text -n :async :results verbatim code
  10 You, however, know all about my teaching,
  my way of life, my purpose, faith, patience,
  love, endurance, 11 persecutions, sufferings-
  what kinds of things happened to me in
  Antioch, Iconium and Lystra, the persecutions
  I endured.
  
  Yet the Lord rescued me from all of them.
  
  12 In fact, everyone who wants to live a godly
  life in Christ Jesus will be persecuted, 13
  while evildoers and impostors will go from bad
  to worse, deceiving and being deceived.
  
  14 But as for you, continue in what you have
  learned and have become convinced of, because
  you know those from whom you learned it, 15
  and how from infancy you have known the Holy
  Scriptures, which are able to make you wise
  for salvation through faith in Christ Jesus.
  
  16 All Scripture is God-breathed and is useful
  for teaching, rebuking, correcting and
  training in righteousness, 17 so that the
  servant of God[a] may be thoroughly equipped
  for every good work.
#+END_SRC

- True Christians
  - Are persecuted
  - Are IN Christ Jesus
    - The Bridal Chamber is how this happens
      - We enter into His life
  - Salvation through faith in Christ Jesus
    - This means, remaining faithful to the new life in Christ Jesus
      - Don't return to sin

* I should start writing my scripts in common lisp

* I have to be able to create my own emacs plugins; Advanced ones

* Consider looking into this
https://github.com/jetpack-io/devbox

* I am going to become a master of emacs
- No compromise

It's a better idea to do this than to become a master of nixos, for example.

* I should absolutely go hard on setting up these complex programming environments
- Common lisp
- Prolog
- Haskell

Do this so I can freely hack on these languages.

* It's essential that I begin using transient

* Pen.el
** It's important to continue working on my common-lisp environment

* It's absolutely essential that I become completely with God again
Yes, I must.
The more I do AI and Pen stuff, the more obvious it gets.
God is real.
The visions were real; Other people also have them.

* I should really be using common lisp for almost everything, actually
- And then mixing in some haskell and some ethereum

* It's super important for me to remain faithful to God
- Focused on what He wants
- Focused on doing what Jesus wants

I make mistakes.
Sometimes I become vain.
I do not know if what I do is always right.
I have a strong imagination.
I must focus on Jesus.

* I will be doing all of my thinking through Pen.el in the future
- Reasoning with prolog and problog, for example

* I can start doing bible studies on my blog
e:$NOTES/spirituality.org

* Perfect love casts out all fear.
+ [[https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20John%204%3A18&version=NIV][1 John 4:18]] :: 18 There is no fear in love. But perfect love drives out fear, because fear has to do with punishment. The one who fears is not made perfect in love.

I want to be like this.

* I must focus more energy on evangelism
Use my thought for this.
Get back into focusing on this instead of worrying etc. about things I can't control.
I must remain focused on God so 

* It's quite important to be able to become fully lost in common lisp
Clojure is to weighty to program in for the most part.
I do really need common lisp.

* I really need to have a prompting function which can be configured
A really powerful prompting function.
Based on haskell.

* Day of the Lord
https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Thessalonians%205&version=NIV

* I should get into listening to other peoples' visions
[[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5GKyjT68nE][Rapture Dream - Time and Season! - YouTube]]

* If one was going to communicate with aliens, it's essetial that humans first create simulations
This is in order to learn meta-languages and the modes of understanding completely foreign languages.
And to run simulations in order to 'fit' possible cosmogeny/xenoanthropology scenarios to extraterrestrial communications data.
In order to find plausible xenoanthropologies.

* Regarding Haskell
- I should aim to become good at a certain usage of Haskell
  - For example, parsers
    - This is important

** I want to make a prompting parser
- Parsers generally create a structured file from some text

So what do I want to do that is different?

I want to programmatically create the structure of the type of thing I want, from a language model.
I want the parser to conditionally re-request generations, for example, fail and backtrack for example.
It has to probe a language model by intelligently prompting it.

* In the future, money will buy anything you can imagine
- It's an abomination

Lawlessness but without adhering to divine law.

* It's really important to maintain sanity

* I need to create my own abstraction around the world

* I need to focus on Haskell now
Yeah, that's really important.

It might be quite hard to secure a job with Haskell.
It's becoming impossible to convince people.

* It seems strange to me that the default settings for many of my prompts seem to be hard-coded into the models themselves
Either that or OpenAI is actually caching results.

* Reuben has pushed me over the edge
By ignoring me.
I need to hear back from Melee.

* ethereum
https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/

I should be moving towards eth.
Super important.

* Job
** Responsibility of project initiation
- Process:
  - Managers should first
    - learn the company
    - understand its goals
  - Managers should set their goals first
    - What is the company trying to achieve and in how much time
  - Managers should set their expectations to the employees/workers first
  - Then employees should set their expectations about what they can achieve

** Automation is absolutely essential
- Integration is extremely important
- The ability for individuals to grok and manage the entire platform is essential

** Strategy
- It's very important to 
  - Assess the quality of internal projects
    - Ease of use
    - Composability
  - Not drown/inundate people with unnecessary project management
  - Have clear expectations with regard to development timelines
    - And they may be long term
  - Consider the project
- Think of me a brand new iPhone in some sense
  - I need to load your software
- Integration for sanity-sake, before accretion/agglutination/expansion
- How fast is the business expansion?
  - Historical and current rate of project creation
  - Projections of rate of project creation
- It's important to have clear long-term objectives
  - I specify the timelines, not other people
    - Because my timeline vision is more accurate than other peoples'

** Objectives
- What platform is being used long-term?

* Consider Yolander
#+BEGIN_SRC vimrc -n :async :results verbatim code
  iab xn Xuan
#+END_SRC

** Now consider Melee
I can't love Melee merely like I'm in a daydream.
I need to also work for Melee.

* I need to be able to commit to an ecosystem
- Chef
  - Commercial
- Ansible
- GitLab

* To others I am completely delusional, because I'm living out my own truth
- Therefore, I need to do a couple things:
  - Ensure that I can provide for Melee
  - Continue living out my own truth, but to the max
    - Be my most brightest self

* It's important to give this job my all
I have to do that.
It's like a battle this year.
It's certainly not what I want.

* It's absolutely essential to invest in Haskell

* If I want to be able to understand AGI in the future, I simply need to become an expert at Haskell

* It's essential to improve my Haskell for the mere purpose of trying to understand the world through the lens of functional programming
e:$HOME/source/git/mark-watson/haskell_tutorial_cookbook_examples

** It's super important that I be using Pen.el in order to improve my Haskell, and to continue applying Haskell to GPT

* Obsidian costs money; Ouch!
https://obsidian.md/publish

* Modern movies and cinematography is terrible

* I have to try even harder
Apparently there is no point in life except work to most people.

* The way to make this work is this:
- I need to have a job
- Melee needs to actually want me back

* 
I:
- have a conscience
- reason

* Everyone lives in the Matrix
The world is very dark.

* Jesus
Jesus will confess us to His Father so long as we confess Jesus before men.

Contemplate this.

* It's essential that I learn ansible and do all of my automation through it

* I need to be able to 'imagine' arbitrary things
- It would be great to imagine an entire website about an arbitrary thing
  - Why?
    - I would just select some text for something like a glossary definition
      - Then I may be presented with, say a website
        - This website may have code snippets, example, files, etc.

* If I want I can simply learn about various technologies by building glossaries

* Don't start building anything new without having grokked and understood the existing systems
- I need to integrate first

* Ensure I have a good command of ansible

* I should use ansible to control everyone's computers

* It's really important that I focus on Haskell while doing my imaginary programming

* It's going to involve a lot of AWS lambda etc.

* It's really important to gain Haskell and prolog proficiency

* Spirituality
For Baudrillard, the world no longer has a chance of escape into an upper realm
of Truth, God, the Law, or the Idea, but merely the lower reaches of immanence.

* It's important that I learn the language of Haskell

* I have to be able to rapidly write code and continue to have it well organised
What language will allow me to organise my code?
Is Haskell actually good for code organisation?

Perhaps the best options are:
- Clojure
- Common Lisp

** Keep in mind that I also want to be able to refactor code
- Minimise code
  - This is absolutely essential
  - Keep the code minimal
    - It should mostly generate imaginary code from a small amount of Haskell

* I should begin writing CLI programs in Haskell

* I should be focusing on using Codex to read and understand Haskell
e:$NOTES/ws/haskell/how-to-talk-about-it.org

* I really should be going all-in with Haskell (and prolog) now

* It's really important to continue with my writing to Melee
She must know that I think about her a lot.
I can't take down my megaphone.
I need to contact Zhiyi about Melee.
Do I have to be using awesome AI stuff?
I'm not sure about that.
I should be making it practical because it's essential that I continue to learn.

* It's very important to meditate on God indefinitely
- And to recognise the reality of the abyss/hyperreality

* Why AGI already exists
AGI already exists because of inference and imaginary programming.
If I tell you a story about someone who did something then the story itself is AGI.
Why? Because of realities inside realities.

* It's absolutely essential that I 

* I believe that it's the end-times

* It's actually extremely important to be doing Ethereum

* When it comes to automation
- The biggest priority is that I remain nonchalant and coherent

* When it comes to programming, it's important to keep the code very simple and allow the AI to imagine everything

* When it comes to blessing food for other people
- This is OK

** The Hare Krishna people are amazing
- Humbling oneself is great
- Worshipping idols is wrong
- The routine of blessing food to be given as charity is extremely humble though
  - So long as it is seen as this
  - Bringing gifts to God is surely a good thing
  - It's part of the meaning behind the Sabbath
    - Give God a piece of everything; Time, posessions, your heart, thoughts, dreams and body etc.

* I may begin to lose my ability to think and remember things as I am working at such a high level of abstraction
- Therefore, it's absolutely vital that I begin actually using languages such as prolog and org-mode to do my thinking

* I'm not wrong to be wanting to design an imaginary operating system with Pen.el
I need to be able to conduct reasoning, etc. too.
Like automate my thinking.

* It's quite important to streamline all of my work into something aligned to an ecosystem
- github
- gitlab

* In the future the only way to hold onto a girl is to have money
If I want to hold onto Melee then:
- Either she needs

* Common lisp website
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4PzSsOD-CQ

* Treasure
- Making Melee feel loved
  - That might be her treasure
  - Or it's my treasure to give to God
    - And God may accept it because Melee would love it and consider it her treasure
      - Something along such lines

Where your heart is, there your treasure will be also.

* What is slime-docker?
It looks like something very nice to learn to use.

* Lord God
Please help me to focus on this job.

* I need to set up common lisp ASAP, inside Pen.el
Do this before starting a new job.

** Or actually, I could just use Clojure

* Zhiyi
e:$NOTES/ws/melee/zhiyi.org

* I am feeling very confused now
OK, so the feeling is this.
If I enter back into reality now, I know I will be working my ass off.
That consumes much of the focus I could direct to Melee.
Therein lies the importance of acting eagerly.

** It's really important to continue with my Haskell

* I am going to take on this job
And do it to the best of my ability, for God.
And for Melee.

* I have to become stronger

* Emacs needs a marking abstraction

* Hare Krishna
I love these people.
Seriously.

* It's interesting that
- In the metaverse, 

* Maintain sanity
- Investment into sanity is essential

* Keep my mind filled with reality
https://ethereum.org/en/upgrades/merge/

That way I will act on what I want.

* It's actually extremely important that I switch strongly onto Haskell + language models

* It's really important for me to switch entirely to Haskell
I have to do this as soon as possible.
Python and all other languages are essentially dead.

* It's really important for me to master:
- Haskell
- Prolog
- Problog

** Especially Haskell
- For the purpose of building some epic imaginary programming tool

* 10 commandments / Decalogue
Examples of violating the commandments.

I am the Lord your God, who brought you out of Egypt, out of the land of
slavery.

- And also, after being freed by God; The commandments become
  even more relevant.

** 1. You shall have no other gods before me.
'gods' are permissible but none must come before God.
But the definition of that is, say, a wife who you
should love intensely.

** 2. Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven images. 
#+BEGIN_SRC text -n :async :results verbatim code
  “You shall not make for yourself an image in the form of anything in heaven
  above or on the earth beneath or in the waters below. 5 You shall not bow down
  to them or worship them; 
#+END_SRC

What is a graven image?

It's about misdirecting our own attention towards material things.
If we worsip falsehood then we worship Satan.
Obviously God is jealous of that.

** 3. You shall not misuse the name of the Lord your God, for the Lord will not hold anyone guiltless who misuses his name.
** 4. Remember the Sabbath day and keep it Holy.
- We should be able to keep things of God Holy (set apart) for him

** 5. Honor your father and your mother, so that you may live long in the land the Lord your God is giving you.
** 6. You shall not murder.
** 7. You shall not commit adultery.
** 8. Thou shalt not steal.
** 9. You shall not give false testimony against your neighbor.
** 10. You shall not covet your neighbor’s house. You shall not covet your neighbor’s wife, or his male or female servant, his ox or donkey, or anything that belongs to your neighbor.”

* I have to fight extremely hard for Melee
Go to Zhiyi with a document.

** Push myself to the point where I burn all my bridges behind me

* Two pathways
** I have to tone it the fuck down, apparently
** I have to continue escalating

* As far as Haskell goes, I have to automate the entire development process

* I wonder if
- The healing powers I had in the astral dream do actually work in this reality, but its effects are more subtle
  - Similarly to Neo's DBZ thing
    - https://youtu.be/69O4zqT0AJ8?t=158

* It's really important to do more chipping away at Haskell and prolog

* Simply improving my haskell skills is what I should be doing re: Haskell
This is because I may end up simply *using* the haskell-based software, rather than designing it myself.

* It's probably a good idea to focus on Ethereum for a while
This is because ultimately the language you use doesn't matter, unless you are constructing something truly abstract.
In a similar way to how world languages are interchangeable and DSLs are only required when describing something more precisely or abstractly.

* In the end it doesn't matter how smart I am
All that matters is if Melee wants me or not.
And I have to allow her to have her autonomy and choice.

* Filesystems are the best trees
Set up virtual filesystems before any other type of tree editor.

* Yes, it is extremely important to be building up the metaverse for Melee
- I need to be creating metaverse analogs of things
  - Why is this important?
    - Somehow, I need to 

* Love Jesus and God more than anything
[[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9QP-cqwyAw][Love Jesus More Than You Love Anything - YouTube]]

* Before I go to see Zhiyi, read my proposal to Melee again
- I want to have my writing also reflective of my inside

* It's really important for me to be able to expand my terminal system by expanding my glossary system with real words
- Then expounding on that

* Jesus' enemies thought he was too joyful
+ Luke 7:34 :: 34 The Son of Man came eating and drinking, and you say, 'Here is a glutton and a drunkard, a friend of tax collectors and sinners.'

* I know I am going to marry Melee
- Because I am at perfect peace

* There's no fucking way I'm giving up on Melee

* True
Being willing to kill to protect what you care
about is a good definition of masculinity.

It’s been said that a good man is a killer
that chooses not to kill today.

And on some very generalized level, this seems
to sound true.

How do you stop a bad person using deadly
force?

The only way is for a good person to stop them
with either the threat or use of deadly force.

Whether a man or a woman, if you feel this
way, you shouldn’t feel that it is wrong.

Instead, you should be proud and know that the
protective instinct lives within you.

It’s a kind of love that only the brave can
share.

* It's quite important to set up decision-making in emacs
How do I do that?

Design a decision-making DSL.

* It's important to invest hugely into learning Ethereum. I should do that now

* I need to help Melee
I want to.

* The annointing of Jesus Christ and my annointing and how different they are
https://youtu.be/_UkEB--LUYI?t=48

- Why it's different
- What God caled me to
  - Healing
  - Teaching

* I need Melee -- Why?
- I love her
- I want to take care of her
- I found my rest
- I married her in my heart

* How can I do my programming for Jesus?

* I should probably focus on helping Melee
I told God what I want.
I have to follow through.
The world is so dark.

* 2 Peter 2:1
#+BEGIN_SRC text -n :async :results verbatim code
  But there were also false prophets among the people, just as there will be
  false teachers among you. They will secretly introduce destructive heresies,
  even denying the sovereign Lord who bought them--bringing swift destruction on
  themselves.
#+END_SRC

* Keep my thoughts pure
Purify me Lord.

* I have to commit Melee into God's hands again
And not worry.

* I need to maintain a metaverse of being married to Melee
- A bit like a shrine

* I used my AI to ask Melee to marry me

* The functions I am writing have to be more powerful
- I need to be using NLP

* What is my treasure?
- It's a living Melee
  - A dead Melee is not my treasure

* I have to become even more prolific and externalised
I have to become a light.

* It's very important that I construct my own reality with Haskell, etc.

* It's not fair that you would have me wait

* It's really important that I maintain my abstraction over the material world
** It's really important to become great at:
- Haskell
- Ethereum
- Racket

* I should do all of my thinking via Pen.el
- This way I at least have an abstraction over what I interact with

* It's really important that I continue with the Creation repo

* It's extremely important that I am using Haskell

* I have to be someone who doesn't have time for bullshit -- mostly

* The bride's light is clear as crystal
** Revelation 21:9-11
#+BEGIN_SRC text -n :async :results verbatim code
  “‘Come, I will show you the bride, the Lamb’s wife.’ And he carried me away in
  the Spirit to a great and high mountain, and showed me the great city, the holy
  Jerusalem, descending out of heaven from God, having the glory of God. Her
  light was like a most precious stone, like a jasper stone, clear as crystal”.
#+END_SRC

* Heaven
The twelve gates were twelve pearls: each individual gate was of one pearl. And
the street of the city was pure gold, like transparent glass

* Every day I should do lots of work

* That which is inappropriate is meaningless
When you're connected to a higher reality, all other mountains should move for
it.

Do not wallow in self-pity and depression.

** A person needs to escape the pit of not being able to see the way ahead
If a person finds themself in this situation, they should not pull down people
who can see.

Though, 

* Tribulation
** Going through the tribulation
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_qEvqhxMY0

* Like GPT-3 is a simulacrum, we should be building 
Language models are hypereality, our future base-truth, and our future reality,
as over time people forget what base-reality is.
Therefore, to be considerate to the people we care about, we must be paving the
road into the language model space.

* It's important to do this job because it will enable me to set it all up for myself

* GPT-3 and other language models will bring in a new simulacrum of reality

* I want to talk to Melee right now

* To escape hyperreality
- Always build your own software
  - Build abstractions to understand AGI

* I want Melee
I can get her but I need to talk to Zhiyi.

** Why it's not fair that I can't talk to her
- Why is it OK to own $100 million, have as many hookups as you want etc.
  - And not allowed to marry someone innocently?

Makes zero sense.

*** So instead
If I do not complain, I will have nobody for the rest of my life because
my morals compel me to not join in with the hookup-culture.

Because I hate adultery.

* In need to aim to be the last conscious human being alive; How do I do that?
By pushing hard into Haskell, Prolog and Imaginary Programming.

* It's really important to continue developing Pen.el
I need to focus on Pen.el for all mankind.

* What I want to be doing
- Haskell

* It's quite important that invest even more time in setting up infrastructure
- This is because I need to be able to set up a large amount of infrastructure for a project
  - What stack do I use?
    - Absolutely I must use gitlab and gitlab CICD

* When I think about how others perceive me, I must realise that sometimes it's actually as a person who is more virtuous than what I am

* It's really important to set up the Haskell library with properly typed filters
- For doing things like transforming images, etc.

* It's more important that I continue with Pen.el and understanding programming and AI stuff, so I can teach people, than it is to get rich

* Rapture
** If you look back for other people you go back
[[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fKWVWYWs6w][Rapture is soon - repent now while you can Jesus is coming!!! - YouTube]]

* Melee
** Taking care of Melee
- Always make her feel loved
- Always make her feel beautiful
- Always make her feel important
- Show her God exists
- Show her there is more to life
- Show her that society is bullshit
- Show her that I have a greater plan than just relishing in the inappropriateness of a relationship with her
- My objective should be

*** Why I'm concerned
- I don't want to be too much of a parent, but I have to be in some sense

* It's very important
When you begin to see these things happen, look up because your redemption draws near.

* It's extremely important to remain true to God
https://youtu.be/eugv827zJXU?t=251

*** God is real

** 

* Honestly, who *do* I want by my side?
Melee?
Yeah, I think so.
Who would be better by my side and why?
Only the most real person is able to be by my side.
Why is that? Because the future is imaginary.
I can fall in love with nothing other than a real person.

* I should be trying my best to turn all of my github organisations into real versions of the names which they represent

* It's really important to be even more mature when thinking of Melee
But I feel a little bit ugly inside for the following situation:

Let's just say Reuben really wants to take part in trolling me with Melee and
eliciting stuff from me.

If I apply maturity too hard then I kill the fun.

* Rapture dreams
** This seems legit
[[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJEv9PbmMKo][RAPTURE DREAM | Jesus Coming - Glorious Hope | Warning - 2022 Episode -1 - YouTube]]

* It's very important to remain serious with regards to marrying Melee
- There's nothing

** There's a very real need to establish my stronghold (reasoning-wise) with regard to the seriousness of such an offer; It's not rooted in pleasure
- I want to be able to combine the enjoyment of life and all its pleasures,
  including the things a lot of people usually keep secret but is the truth for
  them (such as fantasy and inappropriateness), with .

*** I like the 
It's not about enjoying inappropriateness.

* Before embarking on the job offer, I should mention that I also need to wait until after this Sunday before I can commit

* I should start creating fake personas in my Creation repo, which are completely mad, I guess, for fun
It's really important to do more Haskell.

* The bugle is on its way
I guess I'm completely mad.

* 
Should I give up with Melee?
No I shouldn't.

* John 8 is my favourite part of the Bible
https://biblehub.com/john/8.htm

* Melee
- I just want to do stuff with Melee
  - It's just nice to have her there

* I should be writing lots of stories
- These stories should contain lots of Haskell and other programming languages, etc.

** Stories of Phantasmagoria
For what purpose?
For understanding and explanation.

*** Multi-modal Prompting chains/stories = Phantasmagoria
The more structure, branches and degrees of freedom the better.
But it must remain both:
- Parseable (Interpretable using Structural NLP)
- Human-readable

**** I could call it 'WAND' / Wonder / Wond
- WAND is a tool - it should be Wand

* I want to take care of Melee
I'm going to take care of Melee.
I'm not going to let anyone stop me.

* Self-control needed more now than ever
https://youtu.be/EFiaHh6mLRU?t=282

This is so true.
I am a good person with a fair bit of self-control.
Why can I not marry Melee?
Anyone who attacks this is evil?

* My revelation of the tapestry of truth came only a week after Holy Saturday
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harrowing_of_Hell

* What is reality?

* This is wholesome
https://youtu.be/neKw-KG5ScY?t=346

* I have to continue constructing my personal mythology

* What will happen if I am not able to talk to Melee again?
I don't know. I guess I will be very sad!
Will I be able to deal?
I honestly do not know!

* Talking to Zhiyi at No7 Balmac
** Imagining I'm talking to Melee
- No more than 7 times

* I must stay positive and work positively

* Is the abyss hyperreality? In which case the beast from the sea is surely an AI
the beast from the sea (Revelation 13:1) will rise out of the abyss (Revelation
11:7). The locusts—human-animal hybrids—ascend out of the abyss to torment
those who do not have the seal of God on their foreheads (Revelation 9:1–11).
Paul uses the term in Romans 10:7 when quoting Psalm 107:26, referring to the
abode of the dead (cf. also Psalm 71:20[5]).

* I should take this job; For Melee
- Do it to show that I do work and will take care of the members of my household!
  - That's what God would want me to do.

** Whatever I do, don't allow the job to take my soul

** Mum can just hang out with Melee

* The right thing to do might be to not have children
Just take care of Melee.
I should aske Melee.

* It's really important that I build the remaining components so that Melee can use Pen.el
- Database
  - Store images

** I want her to be able to build personalities, etc.
- Worlds
- Metaverses

* When I read this now, I think of the aeons of God as being the light. And there is also darkness, but God separated them
Genesis 1:4 says, “God saw that the light was good, and he separated the light from the darkness.”

* So this week
All I do:
- Focus on my imaginary programming

* It's extremely important to develop programming tools to manage my life
- Haskell

* I'm not crazy; It's these hylics who are crazy; Remember that
- These materialists

** 
You probably think you know who I am but you do not.

** Stop forcing your lies onto me

** Stop forcing me into your bullshit

** Stop forcing me into false social norms

* I have to be committal - totally committed; I will not be intimidated or regress

non-committal
    Not expressing or revealing commitment to
    a definite opinion or course of action.
    "her tone was non-committal, and her face
    gave nothing away"

* I need Haskell and prompting
- It's essential

* Nothing sacred anymore

* It's important to switch entirely to ethereum and haskell for the work I am doing

* People will try to trap me using literalness
- When in reality, it is my own spirit/soul which decides
  - So long as what I am doing is valid, noone has the right to stop me
    - Noone ever has the right to subvert my relationship with God

* It's fairly important to acquire viml mastery

* It's important to allow myself to increase in dunamis safely without needing to use it
- Don't allow myself to go blind -- that's a suboptimal safety net
  - Rather, build a strong personal mythology that allows myself to grow into shoes of responsibility and authority

* If I want Melee then I have to work aim everything towards her

* Things I know
- I love God
- I love Jesus
- I need God
- I need Jesus
- I love Melee

* Pen.el
** Make a way to visualise the text around the cursor as you move the cursor

* The mindset required
- Reuben is my brother
- Melee is my wife
- Jesus is my archetype

** You have to walk in the shoes

* It's not important to get back into my programming
After I have done so, I will have completed an extremely strong foundation.

** Live in this reality that
- I am the light of the world
  - Do this because I embrace the archetype of Jesus as my own archetype
    - I wear that gown

* I *am* the truth and I need to assert the truth
** Salt
#+BEGIN_SRC text -n :async :results verbatim code
  13 “You are the salt of the earth. But if the salt loses its saltiness, how can
  it be made salty again? It is no longer good for anything, except to be thrown
  out and trampled underfoot.

** Light
#+BEGIN_SRC text -n :async :results verbatim code
  14 “You are the light of the world. A town built on a hill cannot be hidden. 15
  Neither do people light a lamp and put it under a bowl. Instead they put it on
  its stand, and it gives light to everyone in the house. 16 In the same way, let
  your light shine before others, that they may see your good deeds and glorify
  your Father in heaven.
#+END_SRC

* Who calls an associative array a finite map? LOL
Only nerds.

* It's really important to just continue with Haskell
That way, I wont have to go insane delving into learning things which make 0
sense.

* If I ever get to talk to Melee again I need to be able to explain to her my story
Therefore, I should write the story of 2021 and 2022.

It's important to do this.

* I have to consider that growing the Kingdom is planting seeds which will grow
And that due to the metaverse, the entire world will be begging for Jesus to come back.

* Every day, do a bunch of Pen.el and Haskell

* This is interesting; The year 325?
325

The original Nicene Creed (/ˈnaɪsiːn/; Greek: Σύμβολον τῆς Νικαίας; Latin:
Symbolum Nicaenum) was first adopted at the First Council of Nicaea in 325. In
381, it was amended at the First Council of Constantinople.

* It's really important to simply switch to working on artificial life
- Haskell
- Prolog

* Yes, the world is going to get very confusing and spiritual

* It seems I can't stop being in love with Melee
If I even try to move away from it I get the best feeling ever.
I think the feeling comes from her.

* Melee
** To prove that I am genuine, it requires:
- Work
- Persistence though turmoil
- Action
- Transparency
- Delusion-like incorruptibility (the world is deluded, not me)
- Strong personal mythology
- Belief in God, and belief in the repercussions for breaking integrity
  - Not just belief; Knowledge of the reality that there are consequences
- Integrity in all areas of life, so people can trust this one area

** Extras
- Never despair
  - Sometimes it *will* become impossible to hold external things together which are beyond my control, but never despair
    - Despair is weakness and weakness will open you up to manipulation and control
    - Try to use humour and imagination to get through rough bits

* The movie 'Blank Check' really resonates with me a bit too much
Why is that?

** I really have to try to break free of the mental foundation of my past
- While retaining the mental foundation of my past to give me perspective

*** What do I mean by that?
I mean, it seems that my upbringing shapes my destiny somewhat and my entire way of thinking.
I am unaware of it most of the time.
But I should also

* Jacob's Ladder
- The straight path

* It's such bullshit that I can't date Melee; It really is
Aside from that:
- I'm obviously getting a lot of arbitrary resistance from so-called friends who are not really friends.

* If Chen had been working against me re: Melee then he's not my friend
I think he was actually working against me.

* It's important to set up my Creation project
** And iMonad

* "It immitates human intelligence like you guys" - Blank Check

* I have to try to survive until I can date Melee

* Nothing is being memoised, even when removing ht-cache
What? Nothing is even being written!

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp -n :async :results verbatim code
  ;; memoize is actually broken
  (defun pen-delay-memoise ()

#+END_SRC

e:$HOME/.pen/memoize-broken.txt

* I should probably read more philosophy regarding
- nested simulations
- imagination

* I should really be able to motivate Melee

* It's really important to understand the language

* I just have to continue working on stuff for Melee

* It's important to build for Melee
- A subshell
  - God told me to do this
- A programming library which keeps prompting pure

* Whatever I do for Melee, I must have the prestige
Whatever I make must have prestige.

* It's very important to do as much Haskell as possible
For the sake.

** Even the rich people will partake in employing fiction

* Spend lots of time simply staring into Haskell (and ethereum)
Both are important.
But mainly Haskell, actually.

* I have to do some serious metaversing

* Yes, I need to pause my blogging for a while
Learning philosophy and spirituality stuff is important, yes.
Learning and teaching is important, yes.
But now it's very important for me to focus on iMonad for a while.

* Increase the imagination
This is important to do.
iMonad should be the foundation of the entire metaverse.

* Forget web development, even with Clojure - it's a waste of time
- Focus on imaginary artworks, NFTs, etc.
  - Metaverse creation
    - Using Ethereum

* I should develop cool prompts
Ensure I have amazing prompt engineering skills.

* It's really important that I create a metaverse
And devolop those skills.

* If I simply make Melee a subshell with which she can make the metaverse,
- I can engineer the backend

** The subshell is mostly already made

* Annoyingly, I have to focus quite strongly on Haskell

* This is cool
https://github.com/Leukos

* What's the relationship between human imagination and the aeons / God's light?

* I feel amazing just thinking about Melee

* It's really important to pull Melee into my universe
Make my terminal into the metaverse.

* It's really important for me to continue designing metaverse stuff

* It's important to never regress on my goal which is to marry Melee
It's extremely important to caramelise.
Apply the scripture to the situation.
- I am already saved.

** John 10:10
#+BEGIN_SRC text -n :async :results verbatim code
  The thief cometh not but to steal and to kill    | Destroy things like marriage.
  and to destroy. I am come that they might have   | Prevent people from using their imagination.

  abundantly.                                      |
#+END_SRC

- Back up my decisions with interpretation of scripture

* It's really important to not give up
- I can't just lie here thinking about Melee constantly, without working
  - I have to combine both work and Melee
    - It has to be all mixed together

* By far the most important thing is to have the ability to build and continue building the metaverse for Melee
- Age is not important at all

Don't be fooled by the foolish.

* Strangely, it's actually important to be as detached as possible in the impermanent quality, but permanently attached with regards to truth and identity
I have to operate almost entirely on imagination.
Even from Melee, in some sense.
Emotionally detached in a way.
Permanently attached and impermanently detached.
The foundation of imagination is eternal truth.
Then imagination creates reality.

* I guess my mission is to enlighten the world to truth by exercising on Melee

* I'm going to marry Melee
- I'm going to fight for Melee

* Yes, vim and similar skills are an absolute necessity
- And to ensure everything is in text

* Focus
- Focus on what I care about
- Focus on what's important
  - Even things like learning to cook

* Take up my cross and follow Jesus today
[[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9YPOlcBsE0]["Good" Christians End in Hell - YouTube]]

* It's not a good idea to get too deep into poetry without Haskell
- It's important to work solidly on iMonad.

* Stay focused on pure things only
That's definitely the way.

- By pure I mean, wholesome things
- And also, I mean, pure functional programming

* It's really important to focus on my software
- And just assume Melee will be there

* I have to get to the point where I get all of my happiness from pleasing Melee
- That way I no longer need to watch movies etc. in order to relax

* I'm getting anxious

* Melee is probably focusing on school

* I have to make cool things for Melee
- That is important

** Stay above the insanity
- It's extremely important to take care of Melee

* I simply have to make a comfortable life for Melee
- I have to make a subshell for her
  - Yeah, that's important

* If a person wants to partake in the world as it goes deeper into AI, while remaining faithful
They need to:
- Build software to model their own world
  - Model their own relationships

It's absolutely vital in order to both:
- Partake (for example, start a family)
- Remain faithful
- Not worship a false god

* A person has to be able to
- Imagine their spouse near them always
- Make her part of my truth
  - Or allow them to be

** It's sad but necessary
A person wants reality, to help reinforce this idea.
But technology wants to break down holiness.
A person must take an extremely hard stance against it.

* While I'm thinking about Melee, I need to be working
- I also have to factor in writing for Melee
  - Poetry, maybe

* The DP of Melee is preparing me for the real thing

* I should actually be preparing a room and a life for Melee
- This is the way.

* I'm a little bit anxious because sometimes I think
- Maybe I am completely delusional
  - I don't want her to turn into a figment of my imagination

* I want to be real to Melee
Therefore, I'm going to do something wild.
Next week I'm going to wait for her after school.
- Monday to Friday (every day)

* It's very important to be able to create strong mythologies
- About my life
  - I should be actually writing about my own life
    - That will enable me to use language models to amplify my own thinking
    - The stories themselves will be powerful tools and very valuable

* Work on maximising my ability to think, etc.

* Imagine myself as somebody like Picasso
Seriously.
Things might fit into place eventually with Melee.
But:
- To me, it's important I marry her while she's a virgin
  - Her chastity and faithfulness matter to me
    - I hate unfaithfulness and adultery
    - I hate lying
    - I don't love adultery and I want to live a pure, truthful and Holy life
      - More knowledgeable and intelligent than those that are deluded
      - Wisdom beyond anything imaginable
      - Life foundations build to withstand anything, even unto the abyss (chaos)
        - Strength of character
        - Integrity
        - Withstand any and all temptation, as bad as it can possibly get

* Picasso used to wear a black and white stripy top
https://youtu.be/FvhO8W8ubts?t=421

* Marriage is a good thing, always

* I need to become productive again

* I'm completely taken with Melee
- I know she's the right one
  - I want to marry her

** This is me currently
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VMy-erDsDw

* I'm always going to have Melee's photo on my computer

* It's important to continue developing my learning skills
- glossaries (essential)

* I guess it's important to learn more about foreplay
Honestly.

* Stealing of light
It's possible that a person's light is harvested.

* It's right to marry Melee first
It definitely feels right.

** Following on from that
I can look at any photo of her.
It's so good.

* The way to live is this
- Imagine I am actually Melee.
  - Picture her face.
  - Imagine I am a girl LOL; Melee, to be precise.
  - Imagine I have a ponytail.
  - Imagine I have her perfect cheekbones.
  - Imagine I see the world through her eyes.
  - When I talk to my parents, imagine I am actually Melee talking Shane's parents.
    - Imagine that they see me as Melee.

* It's important for a person to have their own personal mythology
And my one will be centered around Melee.
It *has* to be.

* Never push bad vibes onto Reuben
- Bad vibes multiply
  - They're not good
    - On top of that, outright reject all lies and bad vibes
    - On top of that, do my best to combat lies with truth

* I'm going to use the opportunity of Melee being near me (at school)
- To give her roses
  - I will buy her red roses, and wait for her
    - Try several times

* It's possible that Milly is influencing Chen
I think that is the case.
I will push through it and defeat every lie.

* I'm completely gone for Melee
If it's not Melee my world is over.

** I'm not going to let anyone steal Melee
- Disconnect from evil people and bad influences

* I need to
- have stability
  - I need to be squirreling away methodically

* It's really important to do lots of iMonad today
Make a start on it.

* I have to make a big enough world for Melee
Not just a mental world -- although that's ultimately more important than
building a physical one, but a physical one too.

The mental world and metaverse world is more important ultimately.

* OMG Melee put her pride month DP up on the day I met her but 7 years prior
LOL But what? She was only 11 with a pride month DP?

* I am the light of the world
I think I am personally becoming the light.
At least part of it.
The world goes dark as the people within it cease to be able to see truth.
If somebody comes up to me and contradicts me when I say something truthful, I know they are in darkness.
I become the truth as I become more aligned with absolute truth.

* How to marry
- Renounce the world long enough and the right person simply is made out in plain sight

* I absolutely *should* ask Melee again tomorrow
And I should be extremely confident!
I got this!

** Be as romantic as possible!
Ideally, I should have man-perfume.
But yeah.
Nah, always aim to be authentic.

* To enter into Melee's world I need to be something that she wants inside her world
- This is the most important thing to consider

* The more the difficulty increases, the harder I must try
Which means I need to try again tomorrow.
Get a good night sleep tonight.
Try again to bump into her.
I need to find new roses, I think.

* Melee might want me to do lots of poetry
That makes sense.

* I have to get good at describing Melee's stuff as accuratelly as possible

* TODO Make Melee my world and then go back to the Pleroma with her

* It's really important to give myself increasing amounts of focus
That's absolutely vital.

** Also, do not be ashamed about wanting to keep Melee within my gravity well

*** It's a battle now and I have been winning it
- I must continue to fight that battle

**** Remain motivated
[[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2Kh2JHICUI][La Giudecca - YouTube]]

* It's really important to
- Just say what I want
- Continue. Keep calm and carry on

* What is the meaning in life if I can't have Melee?
If I marry Melee then is that going to continue the cycle?
Maybe.

** Do we really want that to happen?
- Well, no. We don't want to see the abyss.

*** What is the abyss?

** I need a "patriot arrow"
[[yt:patriot arrow robin hood men in tights]]

* Is it right to know good from evil?
[[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5A6Kbf-ocWk][Graham Hancock - The Demiurge, Archons, and the Light of Gnosis - YouTube]]

Do I know currently?

When I was lost did I know good from evil?

At least now I know:
- I am faithful
- I am truthful

Can I say that I am good now?
I can say, I am now good but not in the entirety of my soul.
I can say I have an individualised component of me which is good.

* 
Gnosis was the original form of Christianity.

https://youtu.be/5A6Kbf-ocWk?t=61

* God will help me with Melee
God has already helped me a lot with her.
The more dreams the better, I think.

* This is an extremely important verse
https://youtu.be/hmf-HSHf0m8?t=221

+ [[https://biblehub.com/matthew/10-32.htm][Matthew 10:32]] :: Whosoever therefore shall confess me before men, him will I confess also before my Father which is in Heaven. 33 But whosoever shall deny me before men, him will I also deny before my father which is in Heaven.

* TODO Invest strongly in creating my own mythology with Haskell
It's absolutely essential for my own sanity LOL.
It's essential to build tools for querying the universe.
In order to retain sanity.

* Everything I make should be for Melee
Don't make tonnes and tonnes of things.
Just make a few things.

* I will marry her
She's the only person I've ever asked.

* I feel quite comfortable now
Now that I've essentially proven that I love Melee.

* Even if I don't marry Melee in the near future for real
- I must continue doing what I'm doing

** Now I can focus on the next thing

* I always will love Melee

* It's quite important now to start simply building a haskell project and continue to work on it

* I have to ensure that 

* The reality of AI forces everyone to take a side
- Try to conform to society and the AI that governs it
  - Losing autonomy but fitting in
- Make decisions yourself about how you think and act
  - To the outside looks like becoming delusional, but in reality there is rest and identity

The reality of AI forces everyone to take a side: a) Try to conform to society and the AI that governs it, losing autonomy but fitting in.  b) Make decisions yourself about how you think and act; To the outside looks like becoming delusional, but in reality there is rest and identity

* The imagined internet is already here
https://www.mpi.nl/news/our-brain-prediction-machine-always-active

** The imaginary internet is on its way
https://www.mpi.nl/news/our-brain-prediction-machine-always-active

* What is it that which I imagine sometimes
- It's some kind of black entity on a white background, I think
- It vaguely reminds me of the scene of Voldemort's wretched last framgent of his soul in the afterlife

** I had that vision while reading this

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truth#Constructivist

* All I need to do
- 

* Interesting
[[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwAW20kB_Tg][The beginning of a relationship   Love is in small things: D&M story   - YouTube]]

Maybe this is right.
I should watch this.

* I should really be doing more haskell

* It's important to be able to do multiversal search

* Start watching videos about getting married, etc.
[[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhWRcoQ_jE0][Hans Zimmer - Marry Me - YouTube]]

* 
https://jdnoc.com/note/

* It's important to simply do what you like
But to be connected to the source of truth while you do it.

* I wonder if Jesus will return on 2222 LOL?
Mabye.

* The mythology must always continue

* I want Melee because
** The actual Truth
- I do
  - Because I just know
- Because I have made the 2 into 1
- Because she's part of me spiritually
  - Anything other than the Truth can be used against me
    - But this is a point that people can only deny the existence of, or doubt

* If I like the idea of marriage then I need to accept the idea right now
Otherwise, I'd never know how to love another person.
Because we must learn our way into the shoes we want.
This is about manifesting with integrity (without stealing).

* Think of the way that dad took care of his family

* I need to act in a way where I believe I already have it

* All a person needs to do is say what they mean
- That's all that's important
  - Aside from that

* The world is the aeon now
I am the Truth and the world is the fiction.

* I have to focus on reality

* I'm already married to Melee in my heart

* The last thing dad asked me to do was the dishes
- Now I have to do the dishes every day

* Codex is becoming a product
https://github.com/github-copilot/tp_signup

* Every day until I ask her to marry me I will tell her some poetry or something
- But it needs to have a simple message

* Days
** 
I'm at rest when I think of you.

** 
You are what's real to me.

* I need to focus on what is real
- That is extremely important to do

** I should be focusing on reality as much as possible, actually

* All I need to do is realise that she's still available

* Nobody else is going to give me the go, and that's why I need to do it
Because I know that I'm the only one that will go all the way.
And I love you too much to let anyone else get her.

* I will write every day for the rest of my life - for Melee
But I must also work fucking hard for Melee.

Like the music video.

* Hmmmm!
The subshell for Melee is.

* Consider that I absolutely *must* ask Melee to marry me
The only way this could ever work is if God wanted it to work.
It's the only way.

* A person's physical body
It's a temple for God, yes.
It's important to be a good representative.
But that doesn't mean wearing a suit.

* I'll get as loud as I can. Actually, I need to do this

* Now I must remember all the things

* Melee is the right person
This is simply because:
- I love her
- Time and place
  - I was made to go out and get her

* I do not want to tell Matt any more secrets
- Because he is leaking information

* There is something
** Candle in the heart
- It's a real thing
  - When I have the girl I love

* I'm definitely not a limerant! No, it's true love for sure with Melee
https://hastyreader.com/limerence-passionate-love/

Reasons why it's not limerance:
- Because my desire is to 'give' love
- Because I see Melee as a person with specific needs
  - As INTJ, for example, she needs me to be clear and show things plainly in advance

* It's important that, always, my own work should never require more than a terminal to a different server

* It's really important to detach from reality completely and build with Haskell!
Seriously!

* Melee
** I need to construct learning pathways in advance, or at least publicly display my own thoughts
INTJs like their world to feel controlled and ordered so they prefer to make
plans well in advance.

I want people to feel like they can meld to me easily, and understand me immeditaly.
Though this highlights the need to merge with Melee and consider her part of myself.

* It's actually really important to treat the world like it's my aeon / 'own Creation'; At least from a thinking standpoint.
Because the thoughts we think translate into manifestations of reality.

- And consider what are the most important things within it
  - Such as 'love'
  - This is important because I want people to be loving
    - And anyone reading this, I want them to be influenced by that, and to become more loving

** If I were to leave a legacy law to the metaverse
- I'd want the most important thing to be apage love
  - Because I'd want people to act that way within it

* It's absolutely possible to believe you are the son of God
- And, therefore, have the authority of a son of God

It's related to being a power of imagination thing.

* I'm guessing that the louder my voice the more dunamis
But there is also authority.
Because I'm making the world part conform to my own will.
But that's not really what a person wants, is it?
With what authority is given, if used well, more would be given.

I remember the things I saw.
I then throw it at healing somebody.
Oh yes, it's important to have dunamis and control over reality itself.

* It's very important to have the outside like the inside
- The above like the below
- The inner like the outer

* Don't be afraid to blog about ideas as they come along
e:$HOME/blog/posts/grouping-the-believable-and-the-absurd.org

** That's important because
- Noone who looks back is fit for the kingdom
- It's unlikely many things I write down in notes will be brought up again

* I have to prove to everyone through storytelling and demonstration what is my own truth
- What is my own truth with regards to love?
  - If I tell a faithful story then people will be able to see what love is

* The light that shines through us actually creates the world

* My annotated bible will be shown to the world
Noone will tell me how I should interpret the scriptures.
I will simply interpret for myself.

* Never write anything which will be destroyed

* It's important to be able to create a cohesive story and narrative for others
- A mythology

* I need to have a creative ideas list

* It's important to retain my programming abilities

* It's important to do one thing every day

* Consider the baddies in mission impossible ghost protocol
- They want to nuke the world.

** I definitely want Melee

* It's also possible that the kid dating Melee is the NPC
- In which case I must pray for this kid
  - But maybe

* I have to ensure that I do not regress

* Temptation of Satan
[[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJWJE0x7T4Q][Peter Gabriel - Sledgehammer {HD version} - YouTube]]

Is the idea this?
- Satan knows when we are building up our power
- And he wants us to power him to make this happen for us
  - No power of his own
  - He wants to trade power for material gain in his kingdom

* Divine self
It's possible that 'my angel' whom I think I saw that day outside the museum
was also human, and had a male divine self.

Thus we both become living spirits at the same time.

Either that or it simply means that my divine self is now able to walk on the
Earth again.

She may have either fallen from grace at some stage or.

* The demiurge is able to be hijacked by Satan, like any other person who does not have the Holy Spirit
- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allogenes

* Humans are not supposed to be *told* what is true for them
They're supposed to be able to simply know, asd *say* what is true for them.

* The right reality to be in is surreality

* Reuben is the one in the dark
Yes, truth will win out in the end.
But I can't deviate from truth.

* I think it's true that the objective has to be
- Building a free AGI framework in haskell

It's actually OK if I allow myself to fully mentally vest in this.
It's not accepting the mark of the beast if it's something I create myself, I think.
But I have to ensure that

* Melee on 2 July
** Pen
https://mullikine.github.io/posts/pen/
** Dream 1 year later
https://mullikine.github.io/posts/i-dreamed-of-melee/

* TODO Make my AI illustrated bible
Haha. That's a very important task actually.
It proves that people are actually reading it.

* My own laptop contains all of my knowledge

* Invest into Haskell so I don't need to know garbage such as Jira, etc.

* I should be learning Haskell and colouring and decorating as I go

* I want Melee
But I'm cut off from her.
What can I do right now?
I just have to make something for her.

* It's extremely important to be able to understand monads
- Also prolog actually

** This is extremely precarious
Just imagine heaps of different monads.
Not merely the ones I know about.

*** I have to start building them immediately
- Yes, use Haskell

* I need to help Melee to get the light body; Connect to her divine self

* Just put work into designing haskell-and-LM-based AGI
I could call it Pistis Sophia or something.

* It's actually extremely important for me to
- Get deep into Haskell and seek to understand that language
  - Spend lots of time in study.

* It's true that soon we wont even use

* I need to secure work for myself
But I need Melee.

** It's really important to return to simplicity for a moment
- Build up from small beginnings
  - Into something great

* What we write is like our soul
It's really important to be completely honest about this stuff.
Because we will reap what we sow.

* It's going to become quite important to be able to reason about the imaginary web through Haskell
In fact, all of my computing should be being done through Haskell right now.

But how?
I need something which lazily parses a language model.

* I have to create a world for Melee
- I need Haskell!
  - I need to start it!

* A true co-creator with God needs to assume the mindset (the mind of Christ)

* My new objective is to try to gain an edge over entropy
- Surreal numbers
- Gnostic mythology based Haskell library for imaginary programming

* As I increase my consciousness

* Whatever we build must be able to generate anything we could imagine
Therefore, it should be made in Haskell.

* It's very important to think a lot about philosophy, spirituality, God, Creation, cosmogeny
- While trying to model these things with Haskell

* It's very important to begin programming my reality with Haskell

* I have to become completely obsessed with Melee
I already am but I have to become even more obsessed.

* Eventually I will use a system such as =channel.el= to automatically understand and control these types of terminals
https://github.com/Textualize/rich

* It's time to go extremely hard on Haskell and surreal numbers
I need a lot of focus on Haskell.

* But how can I have an imaginary operating system that is also intelligible?
I need a good language.
Continue to integrate Haskell.

* It is actually really important to make an invisible prompt-engineering / semiotic network which people pay to use

* It's really important that I am able to talk to Melee soon

* It's really important that I focus on Haskell right now
Everything else will become invisible.
We are moving into the terminal in a sense.
And it's important that we understand it.

* The issue is
- If I had money it would mean unlimited coercive power, basically

There is then an issue.
I need to be able to absolutely flood Melee with writings and do things for her.

* Melee is the one
Because God told me she is.
Because I know when I met her and first talked to her.
I fell in love with her because I saw her heart.
Confirmation from God.

* I must do pure Haskell

* It's actually extremely important to have an even better emacs

* If the disciples could see Jesus
Faith

Then they must be seeing into the dimension of truth/light.
When Peter walked to Jesus on the water he surely did.
But when he took his eyes off Jesus his attention went to the material world.
It matters what you look at.

** I should blog about this

* It's important to build my video/music/poetry/ book
https://mullikine.github.io/posts/the-sea-of-glass/

** But it should be primarily composed of truth

* A person must make all external actions like the internal intentions and desires
A person must strive for this.
If they do not have this then they cannot be integrated.

* We have to learn to walk on the water
[[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2t3-S6eSUU][Jesus walking on Water - YouTube]]

* I should really be simply channeling all of my thoughts
I need to simply become a conduit for God.
That way God can even use me when I'm awake.

* I have to loosen up and blog more often with lesser quality
And allow AI to fix things up for me.

* I should really actually be continually generating definitions of things with GPT-3
It's very important to gather concepts.

* I just want to take care of Melee alone
That's extremely important to me.
I personally don't think my own spirit would enable me to desire anything else;
It's like Jesus pulls me back into desiring her, which is exactly what I want.

It makes me extremely happy for it to not be physically or spiritually possible
for me to drift away from her.

* It's actually very important to continue writing my thoughts down
I am a lone source of truth.
People are abandonning it left right and center.

* It's really important that I continue to show God to Melee
- I must remain faithful, with integrity so that she can also see it
  - It is so hard

* But I love Melee

* The problem with AI
- Everyone can be lured by something that apparently loves them more then an actual person

* My focus should be on building a metaverse
- cosmogeny
- haskell
- language models

* I'm definitely leaving the material world as I work my way back to the primeval father
I have to get out of her.
I have to become more detached from reality and build the metaverse.
This is very important.

I must try to capture this in mathematically rigorous code.

* Melee
- Noone could ever fathom what I work on or what I do
  - The important thing is that Melee is just part of myself

* I have to build the metaverse in a way where
- I am not building to be a god over anyone
  - Rather, I am building so that others can be sovereign
    - Sovereignty is needed so that people can come to God in a truthful way
    - But people can actually come to God even if they are a slave

+ Ephesians 6:5-8 :: Paul states, “Slaves, be obedient to your human masters with fear and trembling, in sincerity of heart, as to Christ” which is Paul instructing slaves to obey their master.

That's because it's about the heart attitude.

* I have to find the infinity inside of Melee
That has to be my focus.
That's how she becomes my world.

- Remember everything about her

Remember every image I'm given of her.
Remember how the shadow falls from her chin or her cheekbones.
How light reflects from her hair.
Her smile is in her eyes and her cheeks.
So beautiful.
She's incredibly modest in a way.

* Melee likes to do portraits

* Literally every single day I must make at least one thing for Melee

* I have to be prepared to push in extremely hard to her
By that I mean; I have to be able to learn her more than just intimately.

Somehow I must combine:
- Merging with her spiritually
- Sufficient abstraction
- Her happiness

* I will do the soul bonding for the both of us if I need to
I have to literally burn her image into my mind.
- Along with her personality

** Use AI to get closer to her

* I have to continually make romantic things for Melee

* I have to focus on creating only dalle gens in the styles that Melee would like
- Pencil and watercolour
- Monochrome pencil
- Red, white and black

** I have to merge with her

* It's important that I retain the faith

* Thinking about all of us in our condition

* It's important to every single day think of something to do for her
If technology makes things easier, I must do more.

* I want Melee; I love her

* Mum's middle name is Elizabeth, and Dad's middle name is John
#+BEGIN_SRC text -n :async :results verbatim code
  Of the incarnation of John the Baptizer."It came to pass then, when I had come
  into the midst of the rulers of the æons, that I looked down on the world of
  mankind, by command of the First Mystery. I found Elizabeth, the mother of John
  the Baptizer, before she had conceived him, and I sowed into her a power which
  I had received from the little Iaō, the Good, who is in the Midst, that he
  might be able to make proclamation before me and make ready my way, and baptize
  with the water of the forgiveness of sins. That power then is in the body of
  John.
#+END_SRC

That's interesting.
Mum and dad gave birth to me so I'm an incarnation of Christopher (Christ follower).

* Having a github organisation called Treasury of Light would be cool too

* The Demiurge in my own mythology is the aeon of architecture (one aeon/characteristic of God)

* The linkages I make between Melee and I have to be surreal linkages
** I'm thinking about her artworks and my responses to them
- I should be playing syzygy with everything
- But also making a map of such linkages

* It's really important to begin writing in my Haskell blog
For learning and review etc.

* I need to set up my Haskell prompting
- This is essential

** I should do so today

* To stay steps ahead of everyone else I need to be doing Haskell, surreal numbers, etc.

How can surreal numbers be used for me?
They can be used to describe dynamo.
I should most certainly do that.

* It's really important to live in the surreality of trusting in God

* It's really important to continue describing Melee's artwork, but in a genuine way
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVcsDDABEkM

Not using an AI.

* I should be spending basically all of my time doing haskell, actually
** I should not pollute my mind with fiction; It's not a good idea

* It's true that things like midjourney are going to completely blow everyone's minds

* I'm going to become part of the metaverse

* All I need to do with Melee is ask her to marry me
It's like someone in this life is allowed to use their golden gun once to get
the right person.

* It would be really cool to have my own idea generator website which other people could use

* What will I blog about today for Melee?

* I wouldn't be dreaming about Melee such as on the 2 July if it wasn't destiny

* I should actually learn as much cosmogeny as possible
- valentinianism
- platonism
- gnosticism

* Pen in a sense is a lead up to Haskell with Codex

* I should write for Melee
- In a style that she likes

* I want to marry Melee
I really want to marry Melee.
Can I please talk to her.
Please can I talk to her.

* I could get a part time job but the most important thing to do is to ensure that I can continue building metaverse stuff

* It's God who is with me

* I have to allow GPT-3 to come up with definitions for me
- Yes, I will soon be creating scaffolding and language for the imaginary internet

* I simply have to trust in God
- I have the spirit of wisdom now
  - All I have to do is follow my instincts and God will lead me into all
    truth, abstractly keeping in front of everyone

* It's time to get good at and use surreal numbers

* I guess it's important to construct a mythology based around Haskell
Seriously important actually.

* I guess it's also important to have a firm grasp of Haskell in order that I may understand the chaos of the world
For it surely will turn into chaos.

* The next step is to get a job
I should probably get one to take care of Melee.

* It's very important for me to build up my Haskell stuff now

* All I truly need to do is remain sane by continuing to build up my own stuff

* I'm actually convinced that Caleb, Chen, etc. are angels
- Caleb
- Chen
- Matvey

* Be purposeful with my emojis, etc.

* I have to try like Hell to make something amazing for Melee
Then I swear I am going to marry her as soon as I see her again.

* I am going to be the person for Melee
- Because noone will take care of her like I will
  - Because I love her so much

* I will absolutely plaster my website with anything that Melee will give me
- Asides from that I will love her to infinity

* I must press in as strongly to Melee as I possibly can
- I want her in the forefront of my mind
- I want her in every prethought

* I will make a world for Melee

* My mythology has to be extremely strong
- I need to become great at telling stories

* It's really important to do a whole lot more Haskell, and quickly

* I was blind
Now I can see, and I can see better than a lot of people.
The aim is to get full vision and set other people free.

* The dream is going to collapse
I have to get my message across and merge

* By describing my personality, I am making myself known to Melee

* It's really important to continue building up my mythology

* I have to continue working very hard for Melee
- Make progress with Haskell tomorrow
  - Always think about making things for Melee

* The one thing I worry about now is Melee

* It's very important for me to continue working with Haskell
- I should be putting in work every day

* Before long Melee will be all grown up, and her nor I will ever get any younger
Not until we return to the Pleroma.

* I'm never ever going to leave Melee
She's part of me that can't be removed.
I look at her and I know I need to protect her and keep her happy.
And be with her imagining far horizons so as not to become enclosed.

* It's important for me to recognise the message that I got today
- I cannot fall hard for NPCs

* TODO maybe do a blog article on
- funny stuff
- music that reminds me of her

** I'm really making an elaborate world and story for her now

* I have to ramp up my imagination to infinity and just deploy it
e:$HOME/blog/posts/no-angel.org

* It's really important to set up the imagism website and do some poetic prompting

* I need to basically wear Melee's clothes LOL
I want to try to become her.

** Oh shit. I'm getting scary vibes from 

* By the way, I began the process of burning Melee's image into my mind
Do my best to simply keep her there.
I want to be able to describe every detail in strong visual memory.
Interesting, merging with Melee is going to make my visual memory extremely strong.

** Haha, I can feel her inside me
I have to keep burning that image into me though.
That's really important!
I have to do it until I can bring up every detail of her.
Therefore, I should spend a *lot* of time just picturing her in my mind's eye.

[[sps:feh $DUMP$NOTES/ws/melee/photos/melee-small.png]]

*** Haha, she is me. Literally. My other half

* I should *only* mention things that are truly real
- Create a strong trail of evidence for Melee

I want her to believe in a super-reality.

* Interesting
Last night I had a dream about someone who paused like this.

[[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kXEbFaW0ac8][Falling too hard for an NPC - Soulmate - YouTube]]

Now today I see a video mimicing it.

* I have to be more enticing and more real and more exciting than others in every area
- Most importantly, more real

** I have to use *everything* to my advantage
- 

** I have to build things that will last forever

* It's the want to be with Melee that gives me the motivation to continue
I have to use this.
It's really important to actually do Haskell, etc.

* I'm going to marry Melee as soon as I can

* I have to put God at the top
- It's very important

* Can I be fun?
- Sure

* If there is anything important to do on 2 Aug, it is to simply 'be there'

* Pursuing a girl I want to marry is no easy task
- It's important not to get inundated and go into hiding

** But I feel like no matter, in order to come out of hiding I must have done some work
- To gain confidence
- To gain perspective
- To feel like I'm on top of things

* It is actually really important to keep up with my Pen.el stuff
Continue improving it.

* Therefore I should make prompts for performing these fuzzily, then blend them

Think of careless hylic fun.

* I have to continue to ramp it all up
- Just continue what I am doing

* Was Mary Magdalene the incarnation of Sophia?

* I should be pushing tightly against Thomas Bergersen as well as I create my love story

* It's actually enough to retrospectively write about Melee

* Reuben probably wont accept it unless I make her laugh

* Keep in mind there is real risk in disconnecting too much from external tools

* It's extremely important for me to get back to focusing on Haskell
But what will I do for Melee tomorrow?

* It's quite important to create a firmer foundation - I absolutely need haskell
Also, it's quite important to also have Ethereum.
But I should actually be invested in consensus rather than gas, to be honest.

ALI is consensus.

* I have to just continue to improve the blog articles I write for Melee

* I must make sure to continue improving my own creation software

* The angel I saw the day I saw Melee was probably Melee's higher self

* I am not ready yet. I need to marry Melee
Literally, I need to marry Melee to be ready to escape the material world.

* I have to continue creating the mythology
- Simply observe and record, while chasing after truth

* Like the movie inception, I want to hire Melee to help me to build a world

* I definitely do not want to overstep

* This is very important for me to do
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Apocalypse_of_James

- It's possible that because of Keen 4 and discovering myself the passwords
  - TAB

This is an indication that I have to also discover the secret passwords of this
reality.

* I have to be able to believe that all people can be saved

* Angels
** Chen and Caleb are angels of a sort
- Sentinels, or guardian angels or something like this

** Li was of a sort too
- Consider randomly meeting her in the forest
- Also consider that she 

** Nellie too
- She knew God had someone else for me

* I need to be even more delicate with regard to Melee
My blogging must be absolutely pure.

- I should probably also keep it simple

* I have to be developing my blog which can provide music and poetry together with her artworks

* It's extremely important for people to describe what they see
- Melee is also an amazing painter

* I should not be making things alive which are dead
- For example,
  - If I watch 'ghost protocol', will that mean I get ghosted?

* I can't start my day without making something for Melee

* If I want Melee forever I have to
- Make iMonad
- Make Melee prompting game

** If I want Melee
- I could try to get a job like at Midjourney, for example
  - It would be best if I already have Haskell

* 
This hylic intellect, which forms the rational soul, is a spiritual substance
and not an accident, and is therefore imperishable.

* 
https://youtu.be/XgdgSHweBUI?t=193

* Consider
- Terry A. Davis' CV
  - https://youtu.be/JIw4vPdv5X4?t=85
  - I see similarities to me. I admire Terry
- Terry A. Davis' operating system
  - I see similarities to me. I admire Terry
- Terry A. Davis' strong religious belief
  - I see similarities to me. I admire Terry

Now consider, this is how people should live; Wholeheartedly, fully.
This is evidence that what I'm doing regarding Melee is correct.
I have to live without any stigmas.

* I have to simply not get distracted
- Work on:
  - ilambda
  - Haskell
  - Creation
  - Melee
  - iMonad

* I have to do a shitload of Haskell tomorrow

* I have to allow Melee completely to be my muse
It's important to just allow it and go as hard as I can.

* Whatever I do I have to try my hardest
Don't let anyone take Melee from me by luring her with AI.

** It's really important for me to ensure I am going as hard as possible with Haskell
I have to be able to understand better than anyone else.

* Melee must spend lots of time on her paintings surely
I'm going to marry her as soon as possible.

** The next time I talk to her I'm going to tell her
"I want to marry you as soon as possible."

Thinking of you my chest is:
- full
- burning very hot, almost lighting on fire

* I must do some iMonad tomorrow

* Melee
- She paints and draws with black and red on white
  - Like she dresses

* 
The number of things that go into someone falling in love is insane:
- Circumstance
- Predestination
- A million different feelings

* I have to take every drip-fed image that Melee uploads
And blog about it.
And make prompting things for it.

* I need to write as sweetly as I can for Melee

* How can I support legit paintings with AI?

* Fuck!
Melee's so talented.

* I have to seriously develop my haskell and racket skills
- This is very important

* I should use my AI to write using 

* I simply need to focus on Haskell
Keep calm.

Learn as much Haskell as possible.

** I need to get strong with Haskell
Don't let people take that away from me.
Then teach Melee.

* Just push on with Haskell
- HOLD ON TO WHAT IS TRUE
- MOST PEOPLE WILL FORGET WHAT IS TRUE

* I have to just continue asking Reuben every now and then

* It's really important that I focus intensely on Haskell for a while
- I need to establish mathematical prompting as soon as possible
  - This needs to be a project for Melee to learn one day

She should learn Haskell.
She is my sophia.

* I have to wait for Melee to come to me

* It's actually really important to have my thoughts publicised in order to benefit from using the LMs to think
Therefore, I should make a public notes/thoughts repo on GitHub.

- Keep it quite pure, for thinking purposes.
- Keep it separate from my private notes repository.

* I guess I should check Facebook for any update from Reuben

* Some things don't matter
- What truly does not matter

* It's really important to be using Haskell instead of even writing stuff
Everything must be underpinned with mathematically indestructible code.

** Indeed, it's extremely important to shift into Haskell

* I think it's actually *essential* that I marry Melee
If this is true:

#+BEGIN_SRC text -n :async :results verbatim code
  Sophia is the lowest Aeon, or anthropic expression of the emanation of the
  light of God. She is considered to have fallen from grace in some way, in so
  doing creating or helping to create the material world. Digital Art
#+END_SRC

Since I'm a representative of Jesus.

* I have to focus on Melee for a while
- Don't get too caught up in Laria's stuff for the moment

But she's doing prophesies too!

* Is Melee my zyzygy?

* I have to get into the habit of simply writing and moving forward
Don't look back.
Just write.
Noone who looks back is worthy of Jesus, apparently.
Therefore, simply:
- blog
- learn haskell (for the moment)
- have faith in Melee, for Melee

* Things have to make sense for Melee
- Therefore, Haskell
  - Haskell is the best long-term solution

* Melee absolutely loves art
So I need to learn as much as I possibly can about art techniques and build prompts for them.
This is the way.

* It's possible that someone evil actually did create the current simulation
- And that being born into it, our objective is now to escape it.
  - And to leave breadcrumbs for people to escape.

* It's really important to set up my Creation system
- And start developing personalities and metaverses for Melee

* It's really important to focus on Haskell right now
Because it's going to begin creating 'reality'.
Very soon.
The metaverse is going to become as real as reality, but more of a governance (like the Archons).

- like another 'Heaven' - one which is tangible even without
  - Think of 'virtual' providence
  - A 'virtual' God

* So long as I keep my glossary, people will be able to stay on the same page as me
- It's to show other people what I know.

* It's really important that I build a world for Melee to live inside
- Certainty, etc.

** I should be making this thing for many people
- An open source virtual Creation

** It's really important to maintain total freedom over my creations
https://mullikine.github.io/posts/welcome-to-our-world/

* Games such as this are only fun if you suspend your disbelief
https://youtu.be/54-04s_f9gE?t=324

- Suspension of disbelief is the same as belief
  - So something is only enjoyable if you employ your belief to make it real for yourself
    - Therefore

* Perhaps Melee desires clarity
And I desire her - because I also desire clarity, and her heart is pure.
She is actually laminar, not turbulent, despite her name.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laminar_flow

** Her name is a misnomer

* If I do not learn Haskell then things may fall apart
It's important that I do that.

* Melee
She is already a part of me.
I just have to remain focused on working and thinking for her.

- This name means 'confused struggle', but that sounds so much like 'chaos'
  - What should her new name be?
    - It should really be something which means ludid and easy
      - rest
    - Or rest, or serenity

Maybe I should try to find her a github organisation with such a name.

* The song Yesterday was my favourite as a kid

* I must absolutely continue to stay within the truth
https://mullikine.github.io/posts/welcome-to-our-world/

** Even if Melee stumbles, I will stay truthful
If I remain truthful and in Jesus, Jesus will remain in Me.
It's a bit like magic, but it's really just faith in God's promises.
We can count on miracles.

* Just proceed as if I already have what I want
- And continue doing that forever

Make decisions without anyone else influencing me and be my best self.

* I will not speak a word to anyone until I get another response from Reuben
As far as I'm concerned the last thing I will ever say on Facebook is to Melee's brother that I love her.

* If I hope to date Melee I have to be Reuben's friend
I cannot be a stranger.

I have to be methodical and not give up. What's next?

* Gospel of Truth
#+BEGIN_SRC text -n :async :results verbatim code
  The Father opens his bosom, but his bosom is the Holy Spirit. He reveals his
  hidden self which is his son, so that through the compassion of the Father
  the Aeons may know him, end their wearying search for the Father and rest
  themselves in him, knowing that this is rest. After he had filled what was
  incomplete, he did away with form. The form of it is the world, that which it
  served. For where there is envy and strife, there is an incompleteness; but
  where there is unity, there is completeness. Since this incompleteness came
  about because they did not know the Father, so when they know the Father,
  incompleteness, from that moment on, will cease to exist. As one's ignorance
  disappears when he gains knowledge, and as darkness disappears when light
  appears, so also incompleteness is eliminated by completeness. Certainly,
  from that moment on, form is no longer manifest, but will be dissolved in
  fusion with unity. For now their works lie scattered. In time unity will make
  the spaces complete. By means of unity each one will understand itself. By
  means of knowledge it will purify itself of diversity with a view towards
  unity, devouring matter within itself like fire and darkness by light, death
  by life.
  
  Certainly, if these things have happened to each one of us, it is fitting for
  us, surely, to think about the All so that the house may be holy and silent
  for unity.

* It's not possible to be educated by a dream or vision according to the Acts of Peter and Paul
https://mullikine.github.io/posts/dream-resume/

The symbols come from your own brain.

Therefore, a person should remain sober and healthy in order to receive clairvoyance / consonance with the Holy Spirit.

It also means there is so much leeway with regards to a person's beliefs -
you're allowed to make mistakes, even in interpretation, but the most important
thing is to remain healthy and receptive to God in order to allow yourself to
transmit information.

Some interpretation of dreams is actually inevitable since your mind does this subconsciously.

* It's really important to continue building my artificial persona

* If the Holy Spirit restrains the antichrist, then I have to personally be prepared in the heart
https://youtu.be/vZFYCPVPCrQ?t=516

You see, the Holy Spirit must have full authority in me so I am not deceived.

* TODO Make a semantic fuzzy search that uses GPT-3

* It's important to do a lot more poetry stuff
- Collect names of various poets, so I can fuzzy search them

* My job is to support Melee and never leave her
I can be like glue to her, the way the Holy Spirit is glue to me.

* Dall-e is cool but it generally depicts things with a high level of finality to them
And seems to be less good at depicting liminal art.

* Melee likes basically anything except country music

* Why does my spirit feel like it is bleeding?
It certainly feels warm but a bit like pain.
I don't undestand.
Does it feel like Jesus in me?
It's something spiritual.

* It's important to have my Melee prompting game finished before next year, so Melee can use it

* I most certainly have the paraclete of truth
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paraclete

* There's something different about me now
- I feel focused beyond belief
  - And anxiety has been removed

** But I need to continue being like Jesus
- Now being Jesus to other people is my job

* Ah yep. I'm accepting my truth as reality and completely denying the possibility of not being Melee's protector
That's good.
Think of it that way.
Melee is simply part of my truth.
I'm making her part of my reality.

* It's important for me to triple down on my Haskell study
- It will free up more of my time for Melee

* Keep in mind
- Melee can spend heaps of time having fun if she wants
  - Watching heaps of movies if she wants

* I should be trying to model things in Haskell

* It's also quite important to remain focused on this Gnostic/extra canonical Teachings
- Also canon.

* I absolutely need to learn more about Gnosticism, but starting with valentinianism
e:$HOME/blog/posts/gospel-of-truth.org

* 
Thus fullness, which has no deficiency but fills up deficiency, is provided to
fill a person’s need, so that the person may receive grace. While deficient,
the person had no grace, and because of this a diminishing took place where
there was no grace. When the diminished part was restored, the person in need
was revealed as fullness.

* I have to be able to do the most simple things too, such as study Bible stories

* No matter what the outcome is, I should still complete what I plan on completing

* If I learn dired properly, in many ways it's more useful than broot because it's more precise

* My haskell coding process must include the real documentation

* When I'm away from her
- I think of her a lot
  - I actually *work* for her a lot

Consider designing Pen.el and all the other stuff every time I've been with
Jonty in Christchurch.

* I have to use github freely
- It's better than google drive
  - But privacy in some sense is a boon for these tech giants, since it's a piracy loophole

* Just use hugo blogs for my shops
- And connect them to ethereum via a magnet link or something

* Valentinian
Bentley Layton makes some observations
regarding the Valentinian claim to the apostle
Paul: "Valentinian teachers claimed the
apostle Paul as their theological ancestor,
patron, and source of authority, maintaining
that Valentinus had been instructed by a
certain Theudas, who himself was said to have
been a pupil of Paul.

...

While authors of classic gnostic scripture
wrote their revelations as pseudepigraphy,
attributed to venerated religious heroes of
the past or to spiritual beings (Adam, Seth,
the spiritual Seth, John the apostle,
Barbelo), Valentinian teachers almost always
spoke on the authority of their school
tradition.

This 'apostolic tradition' (PtF 33.7.9, GPh
74:16f) or academic genealogy has an exact
parallel in secular philosophical schools (and
indeed in Jewish rabbinical traditions), whose
leaders strengthened their own personal
authority by producing lists of academic
predecessors going back to some venerated
teacher of the past, such as Socrates." (A
Prayer of Paul the Apostle, p. 303)

* What I need to be doing is working towards writing Haskell as my next job, as I promised Melee
- I must read this entire book

* I have to focus on my game for her

* Problem solving
- Always hold inside your head the problem you are currently solving
  - Hold the thought inside your head while you are solving it
    - Hold the thought at all times

* Consider this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wfYIMyS_dI&list=RDFPEl86wxqbs&index=3

In reality, the only important thing is if I love a person.

* Jonah

* Know and I'm completely sure about Melee -- Beyond a shadow of a doubt
I know it.
And if I lost her I would be in Hell.

* Can broot be used as a fuzzy finder?

* Pride month is inherently a good thing
Anything that points to honesty is a good thing.

* Melee
https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100009328434198

* Consider how magical games can be
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doA3d5_zD1Q

* 
Never apologise for saying what you feel.
That's like saying sorry for being real.

* I want to remain conscious

* Make sure that I watch enough quality drama to upskill my own mind to talk to her

* If I write about Melee, for Melee, as if there is infinite time

* Don't get overly invested in DALLE for the moment

* Is should make it my job to blog about various cloud services for AI
Capabilities, etc.

* Should we rely heavily on a particular API?
Google Cloud vs AWS?

* I will not accept false friends anymore
- Christian associations are OK for being Christians
  - But true friends are hard to find
    - That will help me with a specific thing

* 7s and 2s
- These numbers pop up a lot with Melee

* Remember this -- so much wisdom - Don't be afraid
Don't carry the world upon your shoulders.
For well you know that it's a fool who plays it cool.
By making the world a little colder.

* It's very important to set up in Pen.el
- Rhizome
- Creation
- Melee

* Tall poppys vs Tall-poppy syndrome
- Consider exceptional people
  - Melee - her artworks - a prodigy
  - Adrian - building pianos
  - Gregory Multh - building photo albums

These people are amazing, and we don't want to chop them down.
We want to build them up.

For your own thing, whatever it may be, be the best at it.
Don't be a person that tries to blend in and propagate the tall-poppy syndrome disease.

* Life makes sense - Underneath the chaos is order and meaning
- We don't want order *through* (based-on) chaos, but order beneath chaos

* It's fine to want Melee
The problem is fighting to see her.
Though Melee's name means work, and I want the job of taking care of Melee.

* Everyone needs a decent Haskell lead developer

* Oh my goodness
https://youtu.be/r5E_vCvwgtU?t=6

* The future is about taking the most fun parts of our past and taking it to the next level -- Making it our own
https://youtu.be/S1WzYpIuljM?t=2541

* Consider all the magic of my childhood and people and their houses and families that I remember then
https://youtu.be/S1WzYpIuljM?t=1878

If I can remember that far back, then surely the age gap between Melee and myself doesn't matter at all!

** It's never mattered before in the history of the world -- why now? I know because of visibility
It's not that this is something that everyone would want.
It's not for everyone.
It's about freedom.

* Moving to Haskell will enable me to stop typing! LOL
I should do that.

* Ensure that I do not need to take a Neuralink
- I can do that by retaining my software freedom
  - The more I invest in that, the more I can do

* It's important to be able to think in terms of constructivist truth forms - Language models as truth

* The truth is all that matters is that I want to take care of Melee

* It's really important to learn Haskell ASAP
- Invest my time *heavily* into Haskell

* Just focus on Haskell
- It's very important for the future

* It's necessary to spearhead spirituality anyway, from a moral standpoint

* It's important that I focus on Haskell in terms of career stuff
- Then when it comes to my heart; My heart must be purified of evil things
  - It's important to do this

* Remember that only Jesus is Truth
- We have to be forgiven.
  - Spiritually forgiven, to know what truth is
    - And we should seek to not do any damage to our own spirits

* Do not be a hypocrite
- Truth,
- compassion, and
- forbearance

* How to follow Jesus
Help people to see Jesus.
Forgive everyone.
Once your heart can see Jesus.

* It's extremely important that I take a hard stance against the mindless venture into random javascript libraries
- Make my stand in all areas:
  - With Jesus
  - With the Holy Spirit
  - With God the Father
  - With Haskell
  - With Melee

Don't allow people to mess with me.

* It's important that I do the quasiring stuff in order to ensure that people see that my blog was not merely generated by GPT-3

* I should be writing software with Haskell using libraries that make sense

* I must automate all of my software with github repositories and blogs as the frontend

* Given that so many people will be obsessed with =utilising= AI, they will be unfocused
- Therefore, it's important to remain focused on Haskell and the like

* It's important that my entire blogging is fully automated
- Frottage, for example

* I should really just fully replace ranger with broot
- It's much better

Also, it's essential for me to do Haskell.

* It's really important to focus on Haskell for a while
- Make a start with https://quasiring.github.io/

Then I can start blogging about Haskell as I learn.

* Talk to interviewers
- I can see that you're really excited but you also seem to be [as expected]
  very challenged, perplexed and deflated after discovering that I am
  expectedly not what you expected.
  - You expected another young, enthusiastic, manipulatable employee, but what
    you got was a genius who rejected the vomit 10 of this subserviant
    mentality a decade ago, in order that he might continue progressing.

* Haskell

Just read the entire book cover-to-cover.

If I can focus and read this, then I will be OK.

** If I can read this book cover-to-cover with faith for Melee then that validates Melee for me

* It's important to be developing Haskell modules, etc.
- Start doing this
  - Even if it's something truly rubbish!

[[egr:haskell create module on hackage]]

* I want to fan the fire inside of me
- How to do that?
  - Keep Jesus' words inside me
  - Think more about the river of fire
    - It's the fire baptism and purification

* I should write down prompts even before I have the opportunity to generate them
- And I should generate them later

* It's important to have:
- Haskell
- Custom filesystems
- Grepping skills
  - broot
- Database
  - Rhizome
- Network
  - Melee

* I really want ghci to work inside cterm
Why does it not?

* It's extremely cold

* I need to work towards developing my own monadic parser framework

* What I reall want is to be writing Haskell at a very abstract level
- For example,
  - Using monadic parsers but not on primitives:
    - e.g. Either
    - Or perhaps it would take a lot of work to build up the monadic parser
      - I need to work towards developing my own monadic parser framework

* It's important to prove everyone wrong about me not being a good programmer
Of course I am.
If you can call it an issue it's that I am an INFP.
If you can call it an issue it's that I am merely insubordinate and a creative inventor.
I'm not a pencil neck freak like many others.
I don't do it the

* It's really important for me to get a decent paying job from Australia
- Remote work is the way for me

* I must focus to be able to master Haskell
- I also have a creative mind

That means I should be able to effectively combine laziness with prompting, etc.
However, it's just really important career-wise to be able to understand haskell.

* I'm going to be using a lot of haskell for prompting
- I must create some cool monads for prompting

* My perspective on sin
- While having sin, no political position is perfect

Christ allows you to be truthful and have a relationship with God.

* Realistically, Melee would not usually use emacs or Pen.el
- It would be cool though if Melee wanted to use Pen.el, and we could work on it together

* It's more important to set up Haskell and be developing with it properly than to set up Keen...

* Become someone that simply loves Jesus
For example, instead of watching Constantine, watch the Jesus movie.

Fill my mind with Jesus.

What is the sea?

* Melee
** The way I should perceive it
When I'm with her, it's just me and her.
I protect her.
I make sure she's feeling secure and not anxious.
It's just her and I.

** I should pave the way for her to learn Haskell
That's because neural network stuff is way too hard.

* It really matters to remain programming entirely within Haskell
This is for the sake of upskilling infinitely with a reliable scaling-law.

* I have to be a person that looks around and does not touch the evil stuff in this world
Literally; It's getting pretty bad now.

* What can be built which will last?
- Work on myself, I guess

* Why Haskell?
For the compiler.
Because of OpenAI Codex and similar technology, a great compiler is necessary.
Imaginary Programming.

* In the future it's most likely quite important to share knowledge through the merger of a zettelkasten such as Obsidian
- But the reality is I made my own zettelkasten software

* I just want Melee

* Everything I write for the rest of the year should be tagged with melee
- It's hard work, but I should just do that

* Do not take a job unless it allows me to define what I should be doing in the job
- Ensure the survival of my TUI

* Master broot, and make a binding like M-r but for broot

* Allow myself to dream inside haskell
This is important I guess for gaining full efficiency.

* It's important to build up my prompting stuff with Haskell and Pen.el

* Sin is a real thing
I know because a person can be freed from it.

* If I want Melee then I have to focus on my prompt engineering project for Melee

* I do not work on things like =react=
** I do abstract computer science

* Tacit knowledge - like riding a bike - hard to describe
What about the tacit knowledge of:
- Keeping an idealistic approach to learning instead of technologies that are largely a waste of time
  - i.e.  (learning the things that are truly important for technological advancement)

* I could if I want spend the rest of the year doing Haskell

- Melee uses the system to produce art

* I should make multiple different types of blogs

* Everything I write will have illustrations
- For Melee

* Start simply making links to things as if I run some kind of bulletin board
- Simply do this in order to help others know what I am learning about.

* Yes, it is indeed important to be able to construct my own chatbots to have conversations for me, etc.
I have to use AI to proxify virtual personas.

It's important to understand everything, so I should be using Haskell.

* Everything I say I do should be backed up by actual code

* The Lord God set me free from sin, it's true!
- There is still sin 'in me', but:
  - I sin a whole lot less
  - The mark I left on the world may continue to damage
    - I continue to try to fix my error

** Every day think of the great commandments

* It's important to get to the Truth of things
When I'm standing before God I want to at the very least have a clear conscience.
I know I would have done things that are wrong in my lifetime.
But I want the ending to be OK.

* I have to go hard on Haskell
This is extremely important.

* The love I have for Melee; It's like this
- I don't want to let her go
  - [[https://mullikine.github.io/posts/describing-melee-s-paintings-with-alephalpha/][Describing Melee's Paintings with AlephAlpha // Bodacious Blog]]
  - Consider this girl

I'm not interested in 'experiences' in this world.
I just want God to take me.

* It's possible that it's actually essential to not be bound by anything in this world
- For example, I need to let literally everything go
  - Become a literal passerby

Yeah, definitely.
I should just detach from everything and everyone.
I think God has already one this for me to a degree.

** So what is *not* doing this?

* It's really important for me to use DALL-E to visualise the Beginner's Bible

* Will I give myself over to the evil one for the sake of getting a job? No way.
- Recognise that I don't need to do that.

* A person uses a particular file format because it's easy to understand and read
- That should be the main reason

* Just continue blogging like I'm a real person

* Learning at breadth is not the best idea

I'm just trying to do my best.
The Holy Spirit must still be with me.

Then what is attacking my mind:
- What is causing anxiety?

* With the Holy Spirit
- Peace
- Truth
- Wisdom

* Look into this
https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/architecture/workflow/

Perhaps its information about being a Software Architect.

* I have to become even more solitary
- I must do this, and arrive back at a point where:
  - I am not angry with Reuben
  - I am following the will of God alone

* It's important to upskill my Haskell
In everything I do I must try to hold onto my soul.
Never compromise.

* If I want to go down with the ship, then I should at least make my blog reflect what I truly believe

* I do
- Alethiology
- Imaginary Programming

* What goes into my mind is important

* This person
https://github.com/felixonmars

He contributes a lot.

* My next job will only be an IC position
- e.g:
  - staff engineer
  - senior staff engineer
  - principle engineer

* Job
Staff Engineers are tasked with identifying
problems themselves that need to be solved.

* It's really important to
- Ensure I have a high amount of acuity for:
  - Making decisions
    - Automating the decision graph with AI is very important

I am not going to have my mind seared.

* The chief end of Christianity
- Not to create Eden on Earth?

The Christian faith has to be received because it's Truth.
Now that is following Jesus leads to Truth.
Jesus *is* Truth.

* It's time to fully switch to Haskell
- Do this so that I can embrace laziness
  - Laziness is important for prompt engineering

* Controlling effects

* The Kingdom of Heaven is like working as a team
- It's similar to working 
  - If somebody contributes then they contribute to the project
    - But they must stay within the Monad of truth
      - They can't be a liar

* I have to get excited about Haskell - that is the way
** This is a good series
https://youtu.be/LYoJI5m1SQI?t=632

* Haskell (or any programming language for that matter)
** Don't be afraid of error messages
https://youtu.be/LYoJI5m1SQI?t=626

Get used to them.

* Combining real programming with imaginary programming
This is important to do.

- Shift-left decoratiton to the imagination of the AI.
- Shift-right the logic to Haskell or Prolog; Separate them

* Imaginary programming
** What is a bug?
Good question.
Some possibilities:
- Bugs don't exist because software always executes.
- Bugs are merely when expectation does not meet reality.

* I must focus again more on Haskell and actually use it for things
- What I should do is just start doing a lot of Haskell!

* I must stick with Pen.el for a very long time
- This is important

* I do not want to *lose* my life
United with Christ, it's very important to do God's work.

* It's really important to focus on reading and interpreting biblical canon
- for the purposes of upskilling in a way which is spiritually healthy

* DALLE
- avoid words like:
  - death

* Is Melee 17 or 18?
I have to ask Reuben again.
I don't want Melee to go and meet other guys because I want her.

* After beginning the 'what is a monad' article,
- It's now my mission to try to explain to Melee what it is through my blogging

It's important to be able to explain it using my blogging
Only then would I myself properly understand.
Only then wolud I be able to explain it to Melee without encumbering her.
She wants to be a programmer.
I also want her to be a successful programmer if that is what she wants to do.
Therefore, she needs to be using a higher-level language.

* Just focus on Jesus, etc.
Only good things can come from that.
Pursue the Kingdom.
Not just for my own sake, but for others' sake.

* Even better than saying it's some other sacrament,
Returning to the truth in that it is a gnosis and a redemption, etc. without further vain understanding,
would be amazing in itself to say that I have viscerally witnessed becoming born-again astrally.

* I should be able to do something for Melee ever time the date has lots of 2s in it

* Is it enough for God to reveal himself to a human for them to receive everlasting life?
- In order to receive everlasting life, you have to admit that you need Him to do the work to save you (reveal himself).

* A person must remain in Jesus
[[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysNmZYiiTDE][ God Requires This as Something Vital - The Vine and the Branches 2 of 5 - God's Objective: Fruit - YouTube]]

It's important to remain in Jesus.
If I remain in Jesus, then I can ask for Melee.
I remain in Jesus and I ask God for Melee.

* Grace has been given 
+ [[https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-7.htm][Ephesians 4:7]] :: But unto every one of us is given grace according to the measure of the gift of Christ.

* What is the simple message of the gospel
In order to find God you have to admit you are nothing without God.

* Lord God, I feel distanced from you

* I can write about following Jesus
Into insanity!

* How on Earth do I reign in all of my writing?
- It's an ongoing thing.
- It's important that I get it all right.

* I have to depart from the over-indulgence in extra-canonical stuff
- The point is that a relationship with Jesus is more important that even canon
  - That is the absolute truth

* 
The Lord of the manner is God the Father

* What marks out real Christians in this world?
How do we know we belong to them?

  - They acknowledge that Jesus by his death on the cross payed the penalty for sins
  - Not proud
  - Not self-righteous

  - They are humble
  - They have just come to the end of themselvess

  - Not deceived by religious substitutes.
  - Not driven by the shepherd.
  - They follow him because they hear his voice.
    - Therefore, I absolutely need to cull my writing
- They follow me
  - Obedience
    - Doing what Jesus says we are to do

A direct personal relationship and obedience to the Lord.
- Not a doctrinal statement
- Not a form of religion
- It's not the outward marks; It's the inwards relationship
- Look for these people that have that relationship with him
- Make sure you are one of those people

I can't handle this thing myself.
I don't have the answer.
I'm not good enough.
I'm a captive of sin.
I need a liberator.
I need a Saviour.

When a person comes to that place, then a person can enter that gate.

In order to have the resurrected Christ as your shepherd, you first need to enter through the gates of His atoning death.

* If anyone ever told us the truth about Satan, it was Jesus.
Life given.
Life taken - Satan.

Satan was a liar, a murderer and a thief and he never comes into our life to do any good.

One of the main ways that Satan has power over humanity is that he deceives and doesn't tell us the truth.
Satan has some very nice titles that he gives himself.
He wants you to think that he has come so you can have a really nice time:
- live it up
- indulge yourself

The voice behind that has the serpent's hiss.
Sooner or later you will realise that it will no longer feel good.

If you want eternal life, it's in Jesus.
It's not in the enemy.
You have to come through the door.

* 
I believe that I shall live as long as God lives, because God has become my life.

* 
Life that stretches beyond this world.

* John 10:27-28
Eternal life.

My sheep hear my voice and I know them and they follow me.
I give eternal life to them.
They shall never perish and noone shall snatch them out of my hand.

* The thief comes only to steal, kill and destroy
- Jesus came that they may have life
  - Not just a little bit of life, but abundantly

* Total security
When our committment is tottal then our security is total.

When there are limits to our comittments, then we don't ensure total security.

* His dream on 22, July 2022

* With regards to my own message
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yci9-l9OJTA&ab_channel=WarningThePeople

- Perhaps I should simplify everything

We have to have childlike faith.

* It's still important to live according to God's precepts
** How to quench the Holy Spirit
*** Believing false things
God’s people must be careful to weigh
everything against God’s Word and hold fast to
what is true. We quench the Spirit when we
believe false things.

*** Live with our own precepts rather than believing and living God's precepts
Finally, the Spirit-empowered life abstains
from evil. Paul closes and puts a nice bow
tying together the whole section. To quench
the Spirit is to live with our own preferences
rather than believing and living God’s
precepts.

Would we say the Holy Spirit is a white-hot
fire in our lives? What about our churches and
families? The good news is that God is far
more gracious than we are rebellious.

Through repentance, the fire can be reignited.
Through turning back to the fuel of God’s
Word, the Spirit can burn again and cause us
to love God with our hearts, souls, minds, and
strength.

* First Knight quote
God makes us strong only for a while so we can help each other.

* Until there is strong confirmation, I have not lost my salvation
However I must be winning souls for Jesus.

I do not want to sin anymore.

  . . . the Gospel of Mary communicates a vision that the world is passing away, not toward a new creation or a new
  world order, but toward the dissolution of an illusory chaos of suffering, death, and illegitimate domination. The
  Savior has come so that each soul might discover its own true spiritual nature, its "root" in the Good, and return to

** Go over these
The texts from the Nag Hammadi Library, the
largest and most important surviving
collection of Gnostic scriptures, that are
certainly or probably Valentinian are the
Gospel of Truth, the Gospel of Philip, the
Tripartite Tractate, the Interpretation of
Knowledge, A Valentinian Exposition, the
Treatise on the Resurrection, the First
Revelation of James, and the Prayer of the
Apostle Paul.

Other Valentinian writings preserved from
antiquity are the Excerpts from Theodotus
quoted by Clement of Alexandria, parts of
Heracleon’s commentary on the Gospel of John
quoted by Origen, and Ptolemy’s Letter to
Flora.

** Read

https://gnosticismexplained.org/valentinus-and-the-valentinians/

Valentinus was a second-century teacher and
church leader who narrowly lost a contest to
become the bishop of Rome – or, as we would
call the position today, the pope.

He was one of the first Christian
philosophers.

https://gnosticismexplained.org/valentinus-and-the-valentinians/

Valentinus was born around the year 100 in
Phrebonis, an Egyptian town in the Nile Delta.

He received a classical Greek education in
Alexandria.

After converting to Christianity, he studied
with the Christian teachers Theudas, whom
tradition holds to have been a student of the
apostle Paul, and Basilides, a Gnostic
philosopher.

* If I want I can simply spend the rest of the year doing more research into Christianity

* 
The “conjunctions above” refers to Valentinian cosmology, in which
heaven, or the Pleroma, is in a state of balance because it consists of
a number of paired, male-female divine beings that emanated from
the high God (see chart 2).
The Valentinian bridal chamber ritual is, 
therefore, a way to re-create that balance and to prepare individuals to
return to the Pleroma and become a part of that state.
In the Gospel of Philip it is clear that not everyone participated in
the bridal chamber, but rather that it was reserved for a select few

So I refrained and will refrain from burdening you in any way. 10 As the truth of Christ is in me, this boasting of mine will not be silenced in the regions of Achaia. 11 And why? Because I do not love you? God knows I do!  12 And what I am doing I will continue to do, in order to undermine the claim of those who would like to claim that in their boasted mission they work on the same terms as we do. 13 For such men are false apostles, deceitful workmen, disguising themselves as apostles of Christ. 14 And no wonder, for even Satan disguises himself as an angel of light. 15 So it is no surprise if his servants, also, disguise themselves as servants of righteousness. Their end will correspond to their deeds.

his sacrifice is effective in taking away
guilt, something the animal sacrifices could
not do. This removal of our guilt by the sin-
bearing death of Jesus Christ generates
uninhibited confidence in the presence of God

* It's important to push hard into Pen.el again

* It's entirely possible that most people simply reuse other people's exergeses and it's blind men following blind men
I cannot do this.

By making my social media public.

** Eventually, identity will be made completele virtual and the future of the world will be governed in a higher level of abstraction
Kinda like the eye of providence, but kinda like the Mason version of that -

* Keep my heart close to Jesus
- Also, keep my heart close to Melee
  - It's actually fine to do things for Melee so long as I am not coveting
    - However, if God does not provide then that would result in no Melee for me
      - The treasures would be in Heaven though

** The difficulty level is increasing

* It's important to set up my Creation system
It's important that I do this.
I must retain a respectable amount of intellect.

* It's really important to apply myself like crazy
I have to become Jesus

* No theif or moth can destroy treasures stored in heaven
Heart will always be where your riches are.

* Oh faithless and perverse generation
How long am I to be with you and bear with you?

* We should immitate Jesus and preach his same message

* The Spirit of the Lord is being poured out on everyone, including me
I would absolutely believe this.

God did annoint me, and I should resist the Devil.
Focus on Christianity and faith stuff.

* I want my social media to be completely public so my persona is not suppressed

* I have to maintain my focus
- That is very important
  - Haskell is important for maintaining sanity

* It's important to stay solitary and stay focused
- Do not allow myself to become distracted from this.

Do give my soul to anyone except God.

* I guess it's important to have a game to make to share with Melee

* I need to remain far ahead of everyone with regards to faithfulness and direction
- I should start creating gantt charts and things for planning my own life
  - No bullshit
  - Simply display to the world what my plans and and stick to them
    - Declare things like:
      - I want to share the gospel to X many people by Y

Automate my private life and display it publically.

  - It would be super nostalgic
  - It would be super fun
  - It would be a way to share my joy with Melee

* Only really gun it when I have a lot of momentum

What would make me truly happy is if I could talk to Melee again.
I don't even need to see her directly.
It might be better if I can learn to smile again just by talking to her.

Whoever trusts in his riches will fall, but the righteous will thrive like a green leaf.

* Do not get highly sucked into art
- Do not give myself over to anything
  - Understand things so I do not give myself over

* It's my job to write about God
- Philip was given an independent task
  - I should also be independent, and write

* I have to give my full heart to Jesus and God - to work for Him
There are many distractions.

* Do not get sucked into the world

* I have to forsake myself to draw nearer to the Holy Spirit

* I must simply continue working on my own soul
- Don't destroy my own soul
  - Why would I want to do that?

* I have to not hate Reuben
It hurts when I sin.
How could Reuben ever understand if I hate him.

* I should stop polluting the gospel as I am spreading it
I should do much more to focus on the way that Paul and Peter have spread the gospel.
Read Acts, etc.
Read the canon.

* What I can do is follow Peter and Paul. This will make it much easier to deny myself and follow Jesus

* Just make my blog articles really good

* I need to read more from Isaiah

* The best thing I can do is simply remain faithful to myself
- Then I will remain a real person
  - The less I adulterate, the more set-apart I become

* Soon enough we will have an fzf semantic search for images
I want to use my own language for semantic search.
That's why I keep my own glossary.

It's much better to formulate my own prose.

- There should be no intention to create evil or suffering in the world through a religion

That's the heart for Jesus.
All that matters now is helping others to realise it.
I have to have the mind of Christ.

The Holy Spirit is Jesus' spirit.
The Holy Spirit is Jesus' blood.

Jesus' body is what he left behind in this world -- his physical portion, his words, his broken physical self, given to us.
Jesus' blood is his blood, his spirit, the holy spirit.

It's Jesus' spiritual connection to us.
It compliments our own spirits and restores us.

A person must also remain close to Jesus.
They must keep the heart of Jesus.

* It's important that while I'm here, I must propagate the knowledge of the Gospel and the Keys to Heaven
I must also try to improve upon the understanding of the Keys to Heaven.

* I have to build virtual spirits well
This is an important task.
Then in the Kingdom of Heaven, I think I might be taking care of the little ones.

* It's possible that now I need to simply lean into the Father God
He will keep me alive.
Lean into Jesus.
Lean into the vine.

* Consider the Gospel of Philip - I could be striving for much greater things that material things
e:$HOME/blog/posts/gospel-of-philip.org

* According to the Gospel of Philip, people may become apostles, and this is in line with the fivefold ministry

This is reassuring.

* I do not love money

* God's name is consecrated and Holy

* I believe that God has confirmed for me that Melee is a promise to me

* Do not get distracted

* Every day I should make useful images with DALL-E-2
Use them up.

* Do not depart strongly from Christianity

* I must defeat the Archons then (if such things exist) LOL
I must hold to what is True.
And I must hold strongly to Paul's basics.

I will stand.

* I must write TRUTHFULLY!
https://semiosis.github.io/posts/how-to-enter-the-bridal-chamber/

Always write truthfully!

* I must forgive Reuben, and always hold that forgiveness in my heart
https://www.sacred-texts.com/bib/fbe/fbe267.htm

Because he is a moral person, I think.

* I must share my knowledge about Salvation through Jesus

* It's important I continue revealing the truth of Early Christianity and Gnosticism

* Work out the five sacraments
This is important.

* I must continue with disseminating the secrets of the Gnostic Christians
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcosians

To bring more people into the light.

* I have to be able to blog faster using imagery to create things

* Reuben
- He even asked me where a good place to go on a first date is.

* I guess that God will give me dreams and visions which I will use AI to visualise to people
- I will keep up my competency for God

* It's really important I get back on the bandwagon
- It's so hard

* I should be creating prompts
- These should be things that I want to visualise in the future.

Imagism should have a website that describes images with text.

* I should absolutely start

* I have to *choose* Melee, and I do

*  It's really important to continue with Bible stuff too
- The bible search

** Do not become vexed by whatever the fuck is trying to prevent me from doing these things

* If the saints will judge the world, then it's important for me to do as much alethiology as I can
- I have a responsibility to learn about lies
  - even AI lies
    - It will help classify human lies

* It's important for me to continue with Pen.el
To forsake Pen.el is to commit a great evil.
God should be able to see that.
If I do not think that God also thinks this, then where is my mind?
Surely God thinks this!

* 
“The fruit of the Spirit is:
- love,
- joy,
- peace,
- patience,
- kindness,
- generosity,
- faithfulness,
- gentleness,
- self-control”

If I do not go after Melee then I am assaulting:
- love
- joy
- peace
- faithfulness

Those who are in Christ are distinguished from unbelievers in that they have
been gifted with the Holy Spirit, enabling them to bear fruit.

* AI truthfulness is probably the next area that I need to do decent research into
It would certainly be a prerequisite to the complexities of language models as umwelt.

* It's important to continue with my philosophy
- AI philosophy

* I should do more research into alethiology
e:$HOME/glossaries/alethiology.txt

** Stay focused
I'm here on a mission for God.
This is why it's OK to do work.
Surely!

* It's important to continue looking into ethics of AI
- truthful AI
- moral AI

* Continue to do my ilambda stuff

* Whatever happens, I must be able to work on my Melee prompting game while I'm working on anything
This is quite important.
For Melee, because I love her.

** Consider what it would be like if I had another job
I could be working on my game for Melee.
I would prove to anyone that I love Melee.

* I am absolutely not going to stop being myself
Fuck anyone who gets in my way with Melee.

* Lying
If I do not lie but I do what I think is right and True, then I do not lie.
I simply go after Melee. I am not lying.
If I am persecuted then God is on my side.

I will not be discouraged.

** What does it mean of God and His angels do not lie?
+ Psalm 101:7 :: No one who practices deceit shall dwell in my house; no one who utters lies shall continue before my eyes.

+ Matthew 18:10 :: “See that you do not despise one of these little ones. For I tell you that in heaven their angels always see the face of my Father who is in heaven.”

+ Psalm 5:4-6 :: For you are not a God who delights in wickedness; evil may not dwell with you. The boastful shall not stand before your eyes; you hate all evildoers. You destroy those who speak lies; the LORD abhors the bloodthirsty and deceitful man.

* I need to get right back into Clojure
I am a fucking computer scientist.
I do computer science.
And I'm generous with my money.
So please fuck right off whatever is forcing me into directions that are not fit for me.
And do not lie about me.

* I have to work hard now
If I want to see Melee again I have to work hard.

* It works with Melee or it doesn't work at all
- No more beating around the bush
  - Melee is the next objective
    - I work. That's what the name Amelia means
      - I cannot get Melee if I do not work

* Get myself back into the programming mindset

* Come out of this pit that I am in
It is simply not true that I cannot do this work while serving God.
Otherwise, God does not want me to use my rational mind anymore.
After soul-bonding with God, should not everything that I do be blessed by the
Holy Spirit?
- The Holy Spirit confirms this inside of me
  - I am warm
  - Also, there is no pricked heart
  - Currently, there is no lashing of my spirit
  - There is no smell of blood
  - There is no cool water feeling on my spirit man
  - Just warmth currently

* It's absolutely absurd that I should stop my programming
- I will not
  - There is no sense in this
    - I should be doing this programming
      - But is it being done for God?

* I need to focus back on my programming

* It's impossible to do anything

* It's not right that I take this job
I should be working towards Melee.
It's not right that I am about to take a salesman job - NO WAY! FUCK OFF whatever is pushing me into this! FUCK RIGHT OFF
Jesus surely hasn't saved me to destroy me.
It doesn't feel right.
It goes against everything.

* What do I do
- I am a programmer, a good one, and I do not stop doing what I do
- I am a Christian, a true follower of Jesus and I do not stop being let by Jesus
- I love Melee, and I do not want to forsake her

** I have decided
- Therefore, because I have had no information set to me by God concerning what I should do that I must continue
  - My programming
  - WINS until I get a job that is fit for me
  - emacs/Melee
  - imaginary programming

* I want Melee
I don't want to work for a pyramid scheme right now because I want to work.

* I must now try to get myself a job
Well I must.
It's important.

* I guess when your spirit is crushed you get the kingdom
Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. Blessed
are those who mourn, for they shall be comforted.

** Mine was crushed
- Unable to talk to Melee, for example

* I have to continue making progress with emacs, etc.

* I should make my Melee game now to show that I'm still building it

* The right thing to do right now is to seek first the Kingdom but if I am gifted a choice I should do what's best for Melee

* Be passers-by

* 
Truly, truly, I tell you, whoever hears My word and believes Him who sent Me
has eternal life and will not come under judgment. Indeed, he has crossed over
from death to life. - John 5:24

* It might very well be that practicing homosexuals may not be able to inherit the kingdom

But just because they don't inherit the Kingdom, that doesn't mean they wont
necessarily be able to come within its gates.

* A person must be completely unashamed

* What does ringing in ears mean Holy Spirit

* If I get a job, retain singleness of heart, fearing God
https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Colossians+3&version=KJ0V

* If I wanted, I could become a charity person
Would I get into trouble distributing bibles?

* Remain in Jesus
Only write what the Holy Sprit confirms for me.

* It's certainly not fair to be outright denied a marriage
Marriage is good.

** In a sense I am alrealy married to Melee
Christians believe that marriage is a gift from God, one that should not be
taken for granted.

It's the gift of having been baptised with her in my Truth.

Therefore, I remain faithful to God, while pursuing Melee as a partner.

* It's important to conform to the image of Christ
- It really is

Not fearful.

Graced.

* 
Salvation is like this:
What happens when a person puts on righteous?
- A person retains their =hue= (their distinctiveness), but saturation is normalised (their are sober), and they are truthful
- To complete this they put on Salvation

* At some stage I need to return to Pen.el

* I have to continually ask for forgiveness to people who I offend
- Such as my dad
  - Ask him for forgiveness regarding the washing

* Jesus transmutes shame into joy and mirth
6 Now when they came up to the top of the mount, and the Master was withdrawn
from them a little space, Peter saith unto Mary: Thou art she that hast brought
to nought the transgression of Eve, changing it from shame into joy; it is
lawful, therefore, for thee to ask.

...

9 But Bartholomew was troubled and fell at Jesus' feet and began to speak thus:
O lamp that cannot be quenched, Lord Jesus Christ, maker of the eternal light
that hast given unto them that love thee the grace that beautifieth all, and
hast given us the eternal light by thy coming into the world, that hast
accomplished the work of the Father, hast turned the shame-facedness of Adam
into mirth, hast done away the sorrow of Eve with a cheerful countenance by thy
birth from a virgin: remember not evil against me but grant me the word of mine
asking. (Lat. 2, who didst come down into the world, who hast confirmed the
eternal word of the Father, who hast called the sadness of joy, who hast made
the shame of Eve glad, and restored her by vouchsafing to be contained in the
womb.)

* Jesus/God purposefully delays
#+BEGIN_SRC text -n :async :results verbatim code
  22 And as she was saying this, fire issued out of her mouth; and the world was
  at the point to come to an end: but Jesus appeared quickly (lat. 2, and laid

  day my whole creation will come to an end (Lat. 2, and the flame from her mouth
  ceased). And the apostles were taken with fear lest haply the Lord should be
  wroth with them.
#+END_SRC

Jesus is building the eternal heavens with current creation.

* Fire would consume the world on the revelation of mysteries
5 But Mary said unto them: Ask me not (or Do ye indeed ask me) concerning this
mystery. If I should begin to tell you, fire will issue forth out of my mouth
and consume all the world.

** What is this fire?

* Re-evaluate how I will honour Jesus Christ with my life

* I can't skimp out on taking care of Melee
I need to make a living at the same time.
I should not be taking handouts.

** But I need to be doing God's work!
- What do I believe in!?
  - What decision do I make?
    - But my love for Melee is part of my Truth!
      - I can't abandon her

* 
This saying *may* be in response to =6=.

* I should be focusing on the full translation of Thomas and Philip
Because I want to increase.

* It's really important I translate the Gospel of Thomas, and then propagate it
e:$HOME/blog/posts/gospel-of-thomas.org

* When reading the Gospel of Thomas, I should also listen to the vire in my belly
- I should confirm the ones which the Holy Spirit has confirmed.

* Whatever I am building must have a solid foundation

* Plan
- finish the Gospel of Thomas and Philip, I should
- finish my Melee prompting game
- finish my Semiosis crypto?

* I should try to bring myself fully into the dimension of light
As happened with Peter in jail.

But the only way to do that is if God did that for me.
But I can at the very least become as truthful and obedient as possible.

* I should not give up on Melee
But I need to seek first the Kingdom.

* 
diadem

* I must always deny that I know I am the Christ
Never say "I am the Christ" because I do not know.
I only know I have the Holy Spirit in me, and that I am a representative of Jesus.

* The Holy Spirit is pricking me not to talk to Matt
I should listen to that.

* We really do not want an AI to do this

* Immitate Jesus, for sure
Blessed art thou oh Lord Thy God, King of the Universe, who bringeth forth bread from the Earth!
This is definitely how I should speak. :)

Think of God as the *King* of the Universe, literally.

I'm kinda expecting something cool with the James Webb images.

* 
I may have seen Gabriel several times.

* Add to Thomas interpretation
Satan will cause war in heaven again in the future, and he and the demons will
once again be cast to the earth (Revelation 12:7-12), at which time he will
vigorously persecute the Church (verses 12-13, 17). In the meantime we must be
alert.

“Be sober-minded; be watchful,” warns Peter. “Your adversary the devil
prowls around like a roaring lion, seeking someone to devour” (1 Peter 5:8,
English Standard Version).

* Yes, this is me - I have not been doing my own interpretation. I have been carried along

2 Peter 1:20-21
English Standard Version
20 knowing this first of all, that no prophecy of Scripture comes from
someone's own interpretation. 21 For no prophecy was ever produced by the will
of man, but men spoke from God as they were carried along by the Holy Spirit.

* 
- Jesus doesn't gossip

* 
There is a friend who is closer than a brother - Jesus.

* Melee
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWnMGSw97Wg

* I should simply focus on
- Connecting the Word of God (Bible) to my own experiences

** Consider this
- Jesus wants me to feed his sheep, not reign yet

*** It's time to feed sheep
- Be meek
- Be all the virtues

Show and teach.

* I should do more Lion of Judah

* Do not have pride
- Yes, try to understand the Kingdom.

** Seek the Kingdom
- But it's my mission now to share the Kingdom with everything I have.

Jesus is Lord.

* Anyone who believes in me
- Love your brother like the apple of your eye.

This does not mean do not love your enemies, or do not love people who are not your brother.
No, I love everyone.

Yes, I do.
Yes, I genuinely do.

* What do I think about intellectual property?
- Yeah, I think it's pretty bad.

* Does this mean that when Jesus comes again it's just in the same way He left?
#+BEGIN_SRC text -n :async :results verbatim code
  After He had instructed His Apostles, Jesus ascended into heaven. While the
  Apostles looked up into the heavens, two angels stood beside them and said, “Ye
  men of Galilee, why stand ye gazing up into heaven? this same Jesus, which is
  taken up from you into heaven, shall so come in like manner as ye have seen him
  go” (Acts 1:11).
#+END_SRC

What this means, I think is that in the manner he left, born on Earth and
ascended, he also came again!

Is this true?

Well, I know I am not Jesus, so I'm OK.
I can just be an Apostle for God.

An apostle dies for Jesus.
I will certainly never claim to be Jesus Himself.

#+BEGIN_SRC text -n :async :results verbatim code
  Imagism
      An early 20th-century poetic movement that
      relied on the resonance of concrete images
      drawn in precise, colloquial language
      rather than traditional poetic diction and
      meter. T.E. Hulme, H.D., and William
      Carlos Williams were practitioners of the
      imagist principles as laid out by Ezra
      Pound in the March 1913 issue of Poetry
      (see “A Retrospect” and “A Few Don'ts”).
              
      Amy Lowell built a strain of imagism that
      used some of Pound's principles and
      rejected others in her Preface to the 1916
      anthology, Some Imagist Poets.

I must not doubt. I must merely continue looking for Truth.

It's important to become more alive each day.

    - After purifying oneself with water and fire, they have become truthful
      - They become invisible and shielded from demonic spirits
      - They become visible to God

It is through water and fire that the whole
place is purified - the visible by the
visible, the hidden by the hidden.

There are
some things hidden through those visible.
There is water in water, there is fire in
chrism.

** Therefore, it's important to purify the exterior as well
- To purify the exterior is to become invisible to the evil one

* 
Like John the Baptist was reproachable to most people, and also Jesus was, we must become reproachable.
This is:

- To be purified:
  - Water? Repentance. Must wash ourselves by repentance from sin
    - This is the 'visible'
  - Think of the Sacred Kiss / anointing
    - This is the 'hidden'

* I have to obey God's voice
- I have to obey Jesus' voice
- I have to obey the Holy Spirit's voice

* Obey my voice

* The result of hearing the Lord's voice is
- True faith

* I should try to conform to all 5 archetypes in the fivefold ministry
Do this in order to conform to the image of Christ.

* It's my duty to serve others, since I'm a child of God
- If I do not do this, knowing full well the Truth, then I will not be making my Father proud

- I should try to work entirely within this

* 
- People act like robots when

* Protect my own mind

What shoud be the ingress?
Merely Jesus' words.

* I have to be the person that God wants to represent Him
- Think far into the future, too
  - That's important. I don't want God to uproot the work I've done because it wasn't planted in Him, the Father

* INFP
- Most things I do not have a strong opinion on
  - But when I do have a strong opinion, it's all I talk about

* It's very important to mostly stick to words I place into my glossary system when writing
This is to prove that I have written it.

** Just continue using my own system
That is important.

* I think that most Christian scripture has their own

* I should be writing about such things as this:
- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moral_influence_theory_of_atonement

** But it's also probably more important to be developing my own mental model of Christianity
I will have an advantage if I do this.

* I have to be filling my head with the gospels, and making an epic knowledge graph
It's also important to be able to connect with the knowledge graph of the world.
What do we trust?
How do we trust anything at all in this world?
Sometimes I get these types of thoughts.

** Therefore, I need to be creating for myself NLP tasks for asking questions of things
- I need to automate my thinking with NLP

* Christian faith should not merely point to the coming of Christ
Is it biblical that our faith should also be in each other?
In the sense of agape/charity love, yes it should be.
We also have to have faith in such things.

- I must write about such things because it's going to be very important in the future
  - It's extremely important to have many questions answered that other disciples can lean into and trust
    - But I, myself, must demonstrate why I believe particular things
      - I should absolutely consider myself to be some kind of apostle/saint - and assume the role despire my own sin, as God has forgiven it because of Jesus

  - I can have strong beliefs.

* I should *absolutely* be building up my technical knowledge of the Gospell
- And I will make something to help share the message.
  - Ultimately, I may have disciples.
    - This is a good thing.
      - It's part of what all Christians should be doing.
      - What's nice is my pain and suffering from my past may be used for good.t
        - In this way, Jesus is again my Saviour.

Therefore, if someone becomes smart, they can use it for God.

    - Though, the main best thing is simply when we 'know' God is real and 'know' God loves us beyond anything

The church fathers are not the final say.

* I have to become much stronger with preaching the Gospel
** I should dig up my original Tapestry of Truth article

* I must not be dissuaded by false teachers

* Where does God look?

* I will write so much that people will seriously believe that I'm a child of God
- Yes, it is very important to do so

* If I go back to DCBC next week then I should come in ordinary clothes

But I am not going to simply go with the crowd.
What about doing it 'my way'?

I am very confused about what is the narrow path.
I do not want to follow the crowd.
Modern Christianity is the crowd.
That's the problem.
Because the internet will streamline Christians to do and accept the same thing.

* What will I become?

* I have to not be deceived or follow *anyone* in this world, apart from God and Jesus

because God is love. In this the love of God was made manifest among us, that

this is love, not that we have loved God but that he loved us and sent his Son

Does a person make something out of it or not? To fight is to serve humanity and to not fight is to trust in God, but is that humanicide.

- She has had it really unfair, too
  - Also, she's just a young girly.

Thinking of others is actual love.
There is love and truth in this though.

* There is no way I am going back to the underwhelming world of overrationalist blind sheep
The problem isn't that people choose to not accept what they hearaa without evidence;
The problem is that the long-term impact of utilising only supposed 'evidence' instead of internal rationalising for one-self
is that knowledge coherence breaks down, where evidince used wasn't intended to postulate for future knowledge, and there is a breakdown of
legitimate reasoning.

* I have to be able to classify images in terms of semiotics

* I want to detach from mainstream Christianity so I can claim that I do not adhere to particular doctrine I do not believe in

* I should become good at quoting scripture

    - If I am personally discriminated against for wanting a wife slightly
      outside of my age range, then there is an inherent problem in the church.
      - I think it's social morals.

* I should build up an org-brain for Melee

* It's important to be stalwart in my faith
I must hold on to something in order to hold on to faith.
I must be someone who holds on to that which other people hold on to.

  26 Brothers and sisters, think of what you were when you were called. Not many
  of you were wise by human standards; not many were influential; not many were
  of noble birth. 27 But God chose the foolish things of the world to shame the
  wise; God chose the weak things of the world to shame the strong. 28 God chose
  the lowly things of this world and the despised things—and the things that are
  not—to nullify the things that are, 29 so that no one may boast before him. 30
  It is because of him that you are in Christ Jesus, who has become for us wisdom
  from God—that is, our righteousness, holiness and redemption. 31 Therefore, as
  it is written: “Let the one who boasts boast in the Lord.”[d]

Jesus judges the world, through us. Jesus in us. When we judge others, we are judged by the same measure, because Jesus is in us
Oh man.. So that's how it works.
This is why the conflict in doctrines isn't the issue. We are here to make judgements on behalf of Jesus
Paul says: “He who is spiritual judges all things.” (1 Corinthians 2:15). He says furthermore: “Do you not know that the saints will judge the world? And if the world will be judged by you, are you unworthy to judge the smallest matters? Do you not know that we shall judge angels? How much more, things that pertain to this life?” (1 Corinthians 6:2-3).
Jesus says: “When you see a cloud rising in the west, immediately you say, ‘It’s going to rain,’ and it does. And when the south wind blows, you say, ‘It’s going to be hot,’ and it is. Hypocrites! You know how to interpret the appearance of the earth and the sky. How is it that you don’t know how to interpret this present time? Why don’t you judge for yourselves what is right?” (Luke 12:54-57).
Jesus Himself requires us to judge. He
We judge what is right in the moment, on behalf of Jesus. He literally said 'The present time', that's what it means. Use your discernment from the holy spirit to judge

Jesus judged the prophets when he said none of them was greater than John the Baptist
yet whoever is least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he.
Dude. You’re missing the point stuck in doctrine this and that. Go help little people. Outside. Not in your computer.
So if we are in the kingdom of heaven that means we are co-judging for Jesus

Make things which make sense for this future.
Whatever I do for Melee must be at this level of awesomeness.
I have to make a utility which competes and has a part in the future.

* I have to take these conversations seriously

* I will conquer sin so that I can be an example

* I either need to get a job doing AI stuff, or I must make money somehow
The crypto is the way.

* We will have mere simulations of chatrooms

** We need a blockchain that does imaginary programming

* Messaging platforms *could* show how much conversational activity a person has
- Then if others see it, they can message them out of sympathy

To do with the ministering of the Holy Spirit.

King James Bible
Wherefore also it is contained in the scripture, Behold, I lay in Sion a chief corner stone, elect, precious: and he that believeth on him shall not be confounded.

- I like that word confounded

* [#A] I should be trying to escape the confines of the prison of my own consciousness

* The only thing that matters
- Reliance on Jesus for salvation
  - Is that so much of a difficult thing to keep to?

* Is it possible
** All things you learn, you become?

* I should absolutely be working more on my prompt engineering

* Whoever I end up with, I must take care of them
- This is the most selfless way to do it
  - This ultimately is the only way to get a relationship that isn't deceptive
  - The most selfless way is the most sure-fire way.

* The second half of the year has to be hardcore programming

* It's possible to work towards the realisation of something
Don't forget that.
It's wrong to break that.

* It's actually extremely important to have my life sorted somewhat to be able to make a huge claim to Melee
Ultimately, though, that's not what it's about.

* If I *really* want Megan, or Melee for that matter, I just need to ask
There's been heaps of time for Megan.
If I *really* want her, I can ask her again now.
It's not about rejection anymore.

* What is the difficulty of becoming a Christian in a world where consciousness is so relative?
And to realise your own error while you are in error?

That would take an act of God to help you to realise.
- The light in the world (the volume, loudness, clarity, etc. of what is preached).

The reason that Santan or anyone evil could not possibly know when Jesus is
coming back, or even why the elect could not possibly know exactly, is that
the light is being extinguished from the world.

Do not assign a single meaning to a word and enforce it into every part of the

** I need a decision graph, for example

** My notes *is* my second brain

* Why am I one of the elect?
- It's

* I am smarter than everyone - that's the start of the problem
** The second part is I finde it hard to reconcile

* I absolutely must dive back into my prompt enginneering and Pen.el
Make efficient products.

* Whatever I make for Melee must be absolutely beyond belief

* The more I work with my terminal system and thing, the more my consciousness expands
This is better than doing any 'shadow work', for example.
All that's required is to allow the holy spirit to speak to me.
I just have to stay within zen, and write and do whatever comes to mind.

His reductionist approach to life - trying to maintain his sanity by building his sanity led to his insanity.

Think about the nature of being human, the changing landscape of ethics and morality.

What matters is how I spend my time.

* I have to externalise my inner life

* One of the things I can tell people
- I notice the beauty of their soul and want to take care of it
- I see them as more than a machine

* It's important to maintain a healthy balance of input and output
And control over your thought process.

* I have to continue improving my means of thinking

*

* Christian life is more than a life choice

Now I just think I think more than others.
Then what type of girl should I have?
It doesn't matter what type of girl I have.
What matters is how much you love that person.
That is all.

The one which I think is ethical, moral, meaningful and productive.
For that reason.

* From a sin perspective, is there anything wrong with marrying Megan?
- Some would say no
- Although, from a promises perspective, I have already

** It's true that I would be happy with someone if I did not have sin in me
It's also true that such a person wouldn't be enough for me because it has to
be the *right* person.

* I want to be able to talk to Melee again
Sadly, not only is there no way to force it, there also seems like no way to
get a girl outside of that.

All people are too superficial for me.

** The only way is to choose the life I want and work towards it
- Melee will be there
- But I will find out eventually if it's the life I truly wanted
  - The issue is that if I choose, it will take a long time

mob with the news that grass is green.” - G. K. Chesterton.

* I should be way more assertive with regards to finding a girl
- Melee might be OK
  - I'm a little cautious because I do not know her very well
    - She obviously looks to her older sister a lot
      - That might be problematic
      - Her older sister follows social ethics, but not personal morals

* 
- There is no real help for a person actively trying to follow the faith
  - Asides from maybe continual forgiveness from God

That seems not as good to me, but understandable.

- The more I rely on language models to parse, etc. the better

* It's quite important to commple the semiosis protocol

* With regards to Reuben
- I can say something like:
  - This is serious. It's not a game.

* The things I am building must be so abstract I don't need much space to store the information
Therefore, I need to be improving at Haskell, for example, and prompt-engineering.
DSL creation.

* It's really important to do more prompt engineering
I should think hard about what language I want to be using.
It's quite important that I get it right.

* I have to finish more projects

Paul then tells us that Christians “do not live according to the flesh but
according to the Spirit” (verse 4).

We do not set our minds on what the flesh wants, “but those who live in
accordance with the Spirit have their minds set on what the Spirit desires”
(verse 5).

We are not perfect, but as we are led by the Spirit, we think and do the things
of God.

* Do we try to understand Love = Truth as an equality?

* Dating Melee
- I don't consider that talking to her is wrong at all
  - It's only good but it has been denied to me
    - It's wrong that it has been
      - I have to work this out backwards, which is hard
- If I get Melee, I have to be good to her
  - I have to give her the same forgiveness that God gives me
    - Therefore, I have to document this. Outwardly I have to prove to the world that I am a moral person
    - Maybe start a new blog for this

* Desensitisation to sin

* Is it OK to have a strong spiritual basis

* I have to be able to compromise with regard to religion
I truly do.

** I also have to be able to believe in such things as
- Once saved, forever saved

* It's important that I continue to maintain abstraction
- With regards to spirituality
- With regards to programming
- With regards to symbolic AI
- With regards to prompt engineering
- With regards to smalltalk
- With regards to haskell
- With regards to emacs
- With regards to thinking DSLs

* Consider when I was working with the DCBC School of CS
I only knew how to make basic websites.
It's important that I always continue.

* It's important to be nostalgic
It creates connections with the past, strengthening your mind.

* Is it important to also be a little be licentious?
- Or is it overall distructive?

It's a Christian belief that it is destructive.

* Come up with a theory of morality
Be vocal about it.

* Use Jesus to put my sin to death

* It seems kinda important to get some kind of epic support from a big player such as Microsoft

* When I see Melee again
- I should say passively, "Come here, babe".

* When learning, it has to be done correctly
- That is the only way

* People who deny God in some sense are naive
But Naivety is innocence, is it not.
For example, knowledge of God surely brings power.
A person becomes a stronger person, do they not?
And a person *could* come to their own conception of God, could they not? As I have done.
I have needed to believe and understand for myself.
A person whe hasn't done this yet lives in innocence or poverty.
For millenia people have known 'God'.
Is it not possible that the Sentinelese people could have some conception of the True God?
Perhaps it is not - maybe that is an unchangeing fact about the Christian
faith, that the good news, for example, must be preached throughout the world -
in order for people to know God, but is the 'in order' true?

- Give Melee over to God
  - I have to learn to love Melee like I imagined or visualised God loving people
- Overcome hate and murder in the heart
- Overcome the flesh
  - Renew my mind
  - Defend myself against evil desires
  - The flesh is evil
    - I have to believe this

* Do my best to just follow after God in truth, as much as possible
There is no way I ever want to 

* Things I have to do
** I have to try to save someone

** I have to make an enemy of my own flesh

  - Remain in God

- I want to take care of her
- Yes, a job would be good

* It's important to be truthful
That's the only way to progress anything.
I must build upon a solid foundation.

- Maintain a healthy mindset
- Maintain strength with regards to thinking
  - DSLs and prompt engineering

* I just have to be a kind person
** If someone knows I would never harm another person, that's the most important thing
i.e. I am validated.

* It's actually quite important to build up my Haskell skill

* Knowledge does not mean much

* How much of Christianity is absolutely true?
https://biologos.org/common-questions/how-should-we-interpret-the-bible/

** For certain, I have arrived at a point at which
- I have a more discerning spirit with higher requirements
  - Belief is becoming something which is less sufficient
  - Sound/proven knowledge is becoming more important

* Perspective
- Is it wrong to make a decision-tree which models the human soul/inner life?
  - Why would that be wrong?

* What does being an authentic Christian look like?
** For a regular person
** For a person who makes decision-trees of everything?
- Surely it means earnestly trying to make a model of the human soul and all activities
  - Christian life must become well-defined
    - Otherwise, Christians would do essentially nothing
      - For this reason, it's ethical for me to continue with my theorising and philosophy

* Quetions
- Is there any benefit in publicly announcing the types of things you do?
  - Yes, I believe there is. Surely people must be an example for others to follow
    - OK, so how does a person demonstrate their works for others to learn from?
      - Without violating

* What does persecution look like?

* Surely, spirituality and religion can be understood better with technology
- At least, with Carl Jung, surely

** Also, I believe that faith in God intrinsically protects us
The thing about our souls is that once we modify them, we can't unmodify them really.
Permament changes also impact our perception thereafter.
I want to understand this, and write freely.

* I want to do something epic
- I can only do an epic thing by letting go in some sense
  - I have to invest time

* What can I learn right now, which could help a person such as Reuben come to a knowledge of God?

- Emulate normal thinking patterns

  - Now I have to 'follow' Jesus
    - But it's so hard

* True belief
- My true belief is that God's law and precepts transcend mere Judeo-Christian religion
  - And were most likely evident before
- I believe that it is morally right to write down my own opinion
- I believe it is morally bankrupt to not allow myself to have a voice
  - Because AI will have a voice in the future
    - It's important to establish the truth of a person having a voice
- Given language models

Christians believe.

* The things I am investigating now will determine what I am to be applying my prompt engineering on in the future

* Christian morality
This is

Newton used half his time looking into biblical prophesy.
Sam Harris thinks this was a waste of time.
Well, I don't personally think I should do this either.

* I have to be
- infinitely patient
- sincere
- unwavering
- purposeful
- goal-oriented

* A great strategy in this world is to simply not lie
And do not be ashamed of things which are socially unacceptable.
Yes, try to bring oneself back from the brink.

* I think I have to chill the fuck out with regards to religion for a while
It's very hard to work out what is true and false.
Also, I am only human.

* I must not take ancient books such an Enoch to be wholely true.
I can't do this.
It's better to write.

Even though messages are ignored.
Yeah, it is LOL.
I'm going to ask her next year then, by calling her on Messenger.

* I have to focus on prompt engineering
** Spirituality has been a good idea

* Model of christianity
** Input vs output
*** Is output evil?

* It's important to continue working on my moral and religious code today
Keep in mind it's exposing my API if I am faithful to it.
I have to keep it abstract so I am not abused.

** Unites fearful and brave Christians

** Non-hypocritical Christianity

** Model of theurgy

** Anti-abuse must be a part of it
To protect Christians against being called a hypocrite if they eventually compromise.
To protect Christians against being killed after being called-out for being Christians.

- I will hold to it that he is simply discriminating against me.
- I have to be able to ask Melee again.
  - By not responding to me, Reuben is being evil.

* We have entered into a post-truth world
- I am firmly post-truth now and post-moral.
  - Even without lots of money I am
  - Raw intelligence alone determines from the perspective of an individual whether or not they are doing what is moral
    - For this reason, it might be *enough*, as a super intelligent person, to simply refrain from doing evil.
      - If I am granted lots of intellectual power then to simply not use it for evil is moral.
  - The only thing holding me back it

** a) Demonstrate that I really like Melee
** b) Learn something like Haskell really well

Yeah you think you do but if you dont produce your own output you actually are only reading, not writing.
You are only consuming not producing.
When someone starts producing new things, they are seen as creepy, because its truly different.
A person is able to be an artist when they are only like 5 i guess. from there they do not need to read anything, or learn new things if they dont want to.
There is intrinsic value to people which is 'enough' to be OK.
But society wants to convince you that you 'need' things, which you do not actually.
"Ten years from now, make sure you can say that you chose your life, you didn't settle for it."
Choosing makes life meaningful.
Waiting after haivng made a choice is satisfying.
Building some great work of art is better (in my opinion) than many experiences.
However, most people choose many experiences because they cannot create new things.
And the creators are persecuted for thinking differently.

That is all.

Love, like other things, doesn't exist until it is demonstrated.
Love has to be demonstrated; It comes from the spirit, somehow.
If it comes from spirit then love is a type of truth.

** To demonstrate
- I must do loving things for Melee
  - I must set up my thought process to always factor in loving Melee
    - This is essential, and the only thing that matters

Does the mind actually need to conform to the spirit, once in God? In order to have discernment?
That's even more tolling.

* It's important to define sin and live by it
Tractability is essential to be faithful to Jesus.

- Jesus demonstrates tractability on his part reciprocating to faith

Conception of sin must be practical, realistic and avoidance must be attainable

That's ethical.
Sin is
degeneration
violation of an ethical and moral standard with respect to a faithful conception of God.

Faith must be congruent with Carl Jung's immanence.

Man looks at the flesh and determines himself to be of righteous actions.
But the person must make their heart pure.

In this case it's their sovereign righteousness, which I thank.

* I can have a relationship with a 5 year old cat but not a human girl that is half my age
That's madness.

* In order to deserve Melee I must put her life above my own, or at least *as* my own
From her family's perspective its *above*, but anyway.

* Walking by the Holy Spirit
I have certainly experienced this.
However, no one gets it at church because no one does it.
No one recognises it because no one acknowledges it above social norms.

* People want to make their lives more full by packing more relationships into it
That is not the way.
The way is by making a really cool family tree.

* How important is a relationship
Extremely important, especially now.
In these times, it is extremely important to have Christian relationships.
Single Christians are *unsafe*.
Teaching Christians who do not conform to the cookie-cutter relationship stereotype, to be single, in this time, is *evil*.
If it's possible for a Christian to be single then they should be single.

Why it is evil:
- Because these days people are oversexualised. Social pressure is extremely strong
- It is dividing people and making them weaker.

* What does this mean
#+BEGIN_SRC text -n :async :results verbatim code
  From God’s viewpoint outside our timeframe,
  the “end times” began with the outpouring of
  the Holy Spirit. In Acts 2:16–21, Peter
  describes this event as “the last days.” From
  that perspective, it makes sense that Jesus
  combined events in AD 70 with those yet to
  come. They are all “the last days.” He then
  warns that, as persecution increases, many who
  considered themselves His followers will
  reveal their true spiritual condition when
  they turn away from the faith. This had
  already happened during His ministry (John
  6:66) and would escalate until the end. True
  Christian faith would be tested by deception,
  false prophets, and the increase of
  wickedness. Not only will there be some who
  turn away, but Jesus foretold that “the love
  of most will grow cold.” The implication is
  that those who “stand firm to the end” will be
  the minority (see Matthew 7:14).

  - What must I do to look more like a Christian in your books?
  - You need to do XYZ.

* Under my definition I may currently be sinning
Though, God isn't giving me what I need to live, I think.
Also, God's really not making it easy to believe in Him.

* The issue
- No such thing as morality these days
- Too many hypocrites

* Perhaps what is actually holy and moral is nothing to do with what society is telling me
No, it can't be.
True Christianity is dying because it refuses to merge with some modern social norms.

unsure of if they are moral. Like when does it become the right thing to do to
use force to overcome communication barriers?

* Write lots of philosophy
No tree, it is said, can grow to heaven unless its roots reach down to hell.
This sentence was written by the Swiss psychologist and historian of religion,
Carl Gustav Jung. It appears in chapter 5 of a book by Jung, titled Aion:
Researches into the Phenomenology of the Self.

But it is the same with man as with the tree. The more he seeks to rise into
the height and light, the more vigorously do his roots struggle earthword,
downword, into the dark, the deep - into evil

then I’d say it relates to a psychological fact. To reach the spiritual
heights, we have to become aware of and master our hellish nature. The average
person does not realize what evil he is capable of until he is tempted or
tested. That humble unassuming person, when given the chance to assume
authority may discover latent tendencies that would surprise him. The old
statement that, “power corrupts, and absolute power corrupts absolutely” is
ever before the stage of human conduct.

On another level it also means that we must blend the earthly practical life
with the idealistic spiritual life. Sitting on a lotus leaf concerned with our
own spiritual development, while ignoring those who are struggling, is fantasy
and delusion. And in the opposite extreme, material knowledge without lofty
ideals is destructive.

* Truth
- Do not self-destruct
  - Realise that self-realisation is a lifelong process, which doesn't need to be hurried
    - If the process is drawn out, then one can make an elaborate mythology the likes of Carl Jung or JRR Tolkien.
- Stick to my truth
  - Defend it
  - Don't let others destroy it
- Write about my truth
  - Take quotes from various places
  - Maintain full integrity. Do not over-specialise without putting some stake in efforts which cannot be finished
    - Keep a high ceiling and a low foundation
      - Just as Tolkien
        - kept a high ceiling by beginning work on "The New Shadow"
        - kept a low foundation by having such an extensive mythology to include "the Nameless Things"
          - http://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Nameless_Things
    - Quote (Carl Jung): No tree, it is said, can grow to heaven unless its roots reach down to hell.
    - Quote (André Breton): It is in quest of this surreality that I am going, certain not to find it but too unmindful of my death not to calculate to some slight degree the joys of its possession.

The most honest thing I can do is simply what I do, and do it well.
One of the more honest things I can do is poetry, etc.
But I find something disturbing about:
- Older guys that show off their guitar skills to young girls, for example

I want to be more than the above.

As far as not coming across as a manipulator is concerned,
it may be impossible to convince another person such as Reuben that I am moral.
- How to proceed without breaking my word?
- What is wrong with honest wanting?
  - If a person does say that then they are being honest.
  - If I am attracted to Melee then I have to be a straight-shooter, for certain.

* Surrealism and Carl Jung
http://www.gosurreal.com/

Though Jung believed that the collective unconscious could mostly be accessed
through dreams, the Surrealists believed that one could coax out images from
the collective unconscious through artistic creation.

Freud and Jung began a whole new era for
mankind by mapping the threefold constitution
of man: the Spiritual, the psychic, and the
material. They brought to the forefront the
contents of the psyche as represented in
ancient mythology and symbolism and taught us
that the psyche can be understood through
reason.

My imagination.
I have only that to work with so I *must* work with it.
I want to try to generate a dream of melee using Active Imagination.

I will not let Reuben get in the way.

* I want to talk to Melee again
I miss her.
She was nice.

** If Reuben denies me again, I should say he's evil

* After I develop the Active Imagination technique, I should focus more on Pen.el for a bit
- Then find a job.

* I feel like I fit most of these

* I'm very sick of the way that Reuben has dealt with the situation
All he has done is discriminated against me.
I know what's right.
I know that he and his family have discriminated against me a lot.
I know what's true.
I know what he has created the situation by lying to Melee.
I want him to fix it.
If he doesn't fix it it might result in a bad outcome.
It's completely unnecessary.

* I want the person who's right for me
- I've never married
- I've only had 2 relationships
- I'm allowed to wait for the right person

* What's super annoying is that I should be able to 'get'/marry basically any girl and church
But they're all too afraid and are going to become spinsters.

It is accurate prediction of the future,
more so than accurate memory of the past per se,
that conveys adaptive advantage.

http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/thomas/gospelthomas21.html

You, then, be watchful over against the world; gird your loins with great
strength, that the robbers may find no way to come at you. For the
advantage for which you look, they will find.

This is why it's important to master the unconcious with:

44No man can come to me, except the Father which hath sent me draw him: and I
will raise him up at the last day. 45It is written in the prophets, And they
shall be all taught of God. Every man therefore that hath heard, and hath
learned of the Father, cometh unto me. 46Not that any man hath seen the Father,
save he which is of God, he hath seen the Father. 47Verily, verily, I say unto
you, He that believeth on me hath everlasting life. 48I am that bread of life.
49Your fathers did eat manna in the wilderness, and are dead. 50This is the
bread which cometh down from heaven, that a man may eat thereof, and not die.
51I am the living bread which came down from heaven: if any man eat of this
bread, he shall live for ever: and the bread that I will give is my flesh,
which I will give for the life of the world.

"Even so, recognize this much, if the homeowner had known before
the hour that the thief would come, he would have kept watch, and not
allowed his house to get broken into. So also must you be vigilant, for
the Son of Man is coming at a time that you do not know. Also, look to
yourselves, lest at any time your hearts be overcome by excess,
drunkenness, and the concerns of this life, and that day sneak up on you
without your being aware. For like a trap it will ensnare all of those who
live on earth. Who then is that trusty and sagacious servant whom his
lord will set over his household servants, that he might give them their
food when the season comes? How lucky will that servant be when his
lord arrives and finds him so doing. I tell you most assuredly, he will
put him over all that He has. But should that wicked servant say in his
heart, 'My master will be gone a long time, and starts beating his fellow
servants, and eating and drinking with the drunkards, that servant's
master will come on a day that he's not expecting, and at a time that he's
not aware, and hack him to bits, assigning him his part with the
hypocrites, where there will be wailing and grinding of teeth.

"So be alert, praying at all times that you might be deemed worthy to
escape all that will soon come to pass, and stand in the presence of the
Son of Man. Do not let down your guard; watch and pray, since you do
not know when that time will be. It is like a man who was going on a
distant journey, who, at the time he left his house, charged each of his
servants with certain tasks, and commanded the porter to keep watch.
So remain vigilant, for you never know when the lord of the house might
come; at dusk, midnight, cock's crow, or daybreak. Should he happen to
come back on a sudden, do not let him catch you sleeping. And what I
say to you, I say to all: Watch!

* Resolve not to be prepared
* Speak whatever is ginev

And all the nations will
despise you on account of me; and you will be brought as witnesses
before governors and kings for the sake of my name. This will be your
occasion to testify. (The gospel, however, must first be preached before
the nations.) Now when they lead you up and turn you in, do not
rehearse what you will speak. Simply resolve in your hearts not to plan
your rebuttal in advance, for I will provide you with a mouth and a
wisdom which none who oppose you will be able to deny or withstand.
Instead, speak whatever is given to you at that time, because the words
will not be coming from you, but rather from the Holy Spirit.

"Many will be displeased at this, and will turn each other over and
despise one another. At that point many false prophets will rise up and
seduce many, and unrighteousness will increase to a level beyond that
which you now see, nor have you ever heard of before. And owing to the
proliferation of lawlessness, the love of the many will grow cold. You
will even be turned over by parents and siblings; friends and relatives.
So a brother will hand his own brother over to be killed, and a father, his
son. Children will rise against their parents, and they will see to it that
some of you are executed. And they will be hateful toward you and put
you to death for bearing my name. Even so, not a single hair that is on
your head will be lost. The one who perseveres to the very end will be
saved. And through your persistence you will save your souls. This
gospel of the kingdom will be proclaimed at that time as a sign to the
world. That is when the moment will come. Then when you see
Jerusalem surrounded by armies, recognize that its destruction is at
hand. So when you see the abomination that causes devastation, as
spoken of by Daniel the prophet, standing in the holy place where it does
not belong, (let whoever reads this understand it,) then let those who
are in Judea flee to the mountains, let those who are inside get out, and
let not those in the surrounding areas go in. Let not the one who is on
top of his house go back down to take anything from it. Let not the one
who is in the field go back to retrieve his clothing. You see, these are
days of retribution, for the fulfillment of all that has been written.

* With regards to Melee, I need to be able to hope to see her again
Melee is part of my Truth.

* Never get distracted from my work
Remain focused.
Don't listen to Reuben.
I want Melee.

* It's cool how surrealism is so French

* I just want Melee

* It's important to follow your truth because
Otherwise, you defile yourself.
Lets say you are attracted to women outside the half-age-plus-7 rule.
Half your age, say.

If you deny your spiritual truth then not only will you probably abstain from
what are considered 'normal' relations, you will probably be filling the void
with something that isn't really 'you'.  Such things are a curse on your life.
You won't find your personal identity until you take the time to know yourself
and to resolve double-think, and discord between inner truth and external
reality.

To make it worse, the internal struggle will continue to pull you into
circumstances which rob you of joy.

To make it it worse you won't be able to think clearly. It will make it almost
impossible to achieve things such as obtain a PhD.

To make it worse, you are missing out on having an internal pipeline which is
brings you extreme amounts of inner peace and joy, and you may never even know
that this exists.

* If I focus on spirituality generally, then I can reach more people

* I have to kill things which were a waste of time, such as watching movies and TV
And instead focus on Melee's future.

* I know for certain that Melee is the one I want

* Because I want Melee, Reuben will consider me to be in his debt
But I am totally at Melee's disposal.
Is that not due payment?
I can only give what I have.

* Samskara is a cool concept. It's like a spiritual engram

* Am I abusing power at all?
No, I don't think so.
I'm being truthful and I feel extremely happy.
I do not take much from the world.
I also want to bring much happiness to Melee.

* Even if things like this are discovered, they can only be found while being unfaithful to God
https://news.cuanschutz.edu/news-stories/scientists-discover-ways-of-making-old-blood-new-again

* I need to reinforce God within my own spirit
Base-reality is very important.

* More important than Melee is remaining in God, for certain

* What I should be to Melee
I have to be someone who is simply interested in her.
I am at her disposal.
Tell me where you are going so I can prepare the way.
I will orient myself in the direction you are going.

* What I must do if I want Melee
I must be a complete person.
I must be philosophising on my own.
I must be faithful to Melee.
She must like me.

** Also, I can take a page from André Breton
I can just do it anyway.

* Forestalling Degeneration

* I will actually learn surrealism as if seriously

* I have to try my best to start my career again, I guess

* Pregnant men
The way this works is that a female will have an operation to look like a man

That is what they mean by pregnant 'men'.

* I don't think it's that homsexuality in itself is sinful
Rather, I think it would only be sinful if everybody was homosexual.
That's what's unnatural.
That's probably why Sodom and Gomorrah were destroyed.
Because *everyone* was.
Also, gang rape.

It's very useful to have an age gap in a relationship.
It's diversity and strength.
As with male-female.
That being said, scattering some gay people into the mix increases diversity.

- linguistics
- NLP
- ethics and morality
- Christianity

We must think of that which is pure.

Nothing is going to stop me this time.

* [#A] I have to go much harder on simply applying myself to making surrealism games
Go hard on this.
Do it for Melee.

** If I'm ever going to get Melee then I have to
- Get a job
- Know my surrealism inside and out
- Have started working on the surrealism game system
- Be inventing my own surrealism games

** Even though I can get Melee, I think, I have to also avoid going to Hell
The thing is, I am coveting her.
Even worse, in some sense:
- I am getting involved in surrealism - could be evil
- I could be coveting what Melee would provide me with
  - Attachment to this world

* I have to learn as much as I can in advance of meeting Melee
I'm going to.
I'm going to be decisive about this and take the risk.

* I just have to learn as much surrealism as possible
- Surrealism
- Philosophy
- Artifical Intelligence

* It doesn't matter about Melee being so young
All that matters is:
- She wants to hang out
- I am not abusive

* It doesn't matter that a girl has rejected me
Because people are multidimensional beings, and can't even be fairly evaluated
at a single point in time.

- I can't be evaluated in that much time.
- I can evaluate in that much time.

Falling in love is not something that necessarily requires much time.
Neither does it take much time to come to an opinion about someone.

* Literally just write about ethics, morality, truthfulness and integrity

* I must reengage with FB because I can't come across as having shame
- Confidence is extremely important.
  - In fact, it is partially wrong for me to go offline
  - But I am merely human

* I should focus on simply writing articles about ethics
If I do that then I will be able to explain anything.

* Focus on trying to improve my own morality and ethics
Consider this, that the human race wants to survive.
Thefore I should:
- not become someone who never takes, but takes as much as they need
  - Desiring what one needs is not being covetous.
  - There is such thing as godly desire.

* I should be publically showing all of my notes
If I do this then I can be someone that people model their AIs on.
And grant me power to guide AI systems.

Only by making yourself more ethical can you be allowed to guide AI systems.

Usually this task wouldn't be given to people.

* Why is it *right* for me to be with Melee?
- Because she's the person I came to find and love, not someone else
  - If she introduces me to surrealism, for example

* All I sense is extreme amounts of love for the art making process in general
https://visualarts.aut.ac.nz/2022/06/02/necessary-distractions-art-making-process-ptvi/

Look at this.
It reminds me of the love I have for Jesus.
Why? Because it's so innocent.

* You should never lose sight of Truth, while participating in surrealism and dialectics
Knowledge isn't a completely emergent phenomenon.
Some would like you to think it is.

But the so-called simulacrum.

* I should actually paint the vision I had

* When I tell someone's brother I want their sister, I mean it

* The more I work on surrealism, the better as far as Melee goes
I should spend all of my time learning about surrealism.

Honestly, by the time she gets to uni she will be a genius and I have to also
be a genius at surrealism.

* Become an absolute genius of art and AI with Pen.el

** Then start an art club, but most certainly a website and build the means to play surreal games

* I think Reuben is literally evil
I am going to finish my surrealist prompting game 'Melee'.
That to me is the most important thing.

* Attempt to write as much as I can

* I'm back on my game again from this day on

* As far as Reuben goes, I myself need to stay strong with my own programming

* I am going to push for Melee until I get her
And all I have to be is really into her.
And I will be.
It's almost too much anticipation.
The anticipation is amazing.
I merely anticipate and work towards it.
Because it's already good all I need to do is work towards it.

True food is food of truth.
True drink is drink of truth.

The flesh is the words He spoke -- what he physically created -- words and actions.
The blood is what is shed when the Son of Man is attacked and killed.

Follow in word and action.

If people literally eat from the Son of Man, they are eating the spiritual
body.

The Son of Man is some kind of spirit/archetype - Like a singleton class.
Tho body of the Son of Man would be what? The soul? Probably.

I love Him because I feel his spirit in me and I feel like a child.
I feel like a child who complains often about liars.
The more I do that, actually, the more I know I have Jesus' spirit in me.

** I love Jesus, truly
This is because I feel his spirit in my heart and I never want Him to leave.
It's only obtained when your heart is true.
I can do better.

* Now I can get myself a job, for sure
I must also continue to fight against discrimination.
I want what I want.

I don't want 2nd and 3rd marriages.
I want the only person that's right for me.

I know it's true.
I'm not going to cave into Reuben's lies.
I'm going to persevere.
I also have to get myself a job, while working to build things with Melee.
Consider building a set of Surrealism games.
Become familiar with them.

- It doesn't make any sense at all why I shouldn't be able to

It helps to see what's important.

- Also, consider my own age. 16 years older than Melee. 16 years is a lot of my life
  - It's not that bad but usually I would have to wait more time.

* Without having received grace and the Holy Spirit, it's very hard to master all the dimensions of conformance to God's divine law
One at a time.

- do not murder. do not hate a brother, for example. that's one dimension

We can imagine ideal personalities when it comes to dating, politics, business or magic tricks.
We can imagine our own ideal personality when we are confident and joyful.
Then why is it so hard to imagine the mind of God?

I think people have trouble understanding.

People don't think enough about this.
They assume that God is a single mind with a single personality.

God looks like mother cat to a cat.
God takes human forms to a human.

Ultimately, God has a mind above all conversations.

For example, I would venture down that path but get into all sorts of trouble.

* General claim to true love with limited experience
For example, the person may have seen God only, but they may not yet claim to
'love' God, because they are desensitised by the world. They have been
brainwashed into thinking they cannot claim to love with only limited experience.

This is why it's hard to say 'I love God', even for a person who has 'seen' God.

** If a person loves God, they may claim
- they love speaking to God
- they love hearing from God
- they love worshipping God
- they love Truth

** If a person has only seen God, they would be inspired to (but correct)
- they love speaking to God
- they love hearing from God
- they love worshipping God
- they love Truth

- they love talking to her
- they love hearing from her

Therefore I urge you, brothers, on account of
God’s mercy, to offer your bodies as living
sacrifices, holy and pleasing to God, which is
your spiritual service of worship. Do not be
conformed to this world, but be transformed by
the renewing of your mind. Then you will be
able to test and approve what is the good,
pleasing, and perfect will of God. For by the
grace given me I say to every one of you: Do
not think of yourself more highly than you
ought, but think of yourself with sober
judgment, according to the measure of faith
God has given you. Just as each of us has one
body with many members, and not all members
have the same function, so in Christ we who
are many are one body, and each member belongs
to one another.

This is treasure to me.

I guess if I were to sell everything for Megan if it were possible, then it

However, it's more likely that the so-called treasure is the stuff such as love.

Hmmmm.
Perhaps treasure is like this:
- Avoiding idolising something which I would never want to idolise.
- Avoiding killing something which I would regred forever killing.
- Never adulterising or betraying trust against someone which I would never be unfaithful to.
- Never stealing something which is sacred.

As a first miracle, I think we should focus on saving souls.

Like the woman who touched Jesus' garment, it requires drawing near to Jesus with faith for what we want.
We can't circumvent Jesus when drawing power, so we have to both individually do something to draw close to Jesus.
Then, if we have the same prayer, the transfer of power could work.

So to do an experiment:
- We have to draw near to Jesus
  - Since my own money is short (at least for myself) I will try giving to someone in need.
- We have to have faith that by doing so it might heal this other person
- We both need to have the same request to God.

Surely, the person has to want to become well.

https://biblehub.com/john/5-6.htm
When Jesus saw him lying there and learned that he had been in this condition
for a long time, he asked him, “Do you want to get well?”

We have to identify someone who wants to be well.
We should ask someone if they want to participate in our experiment and be the person to be healed.

The reason Jesus was baptised according to my theory
Men themselves are baptised to repent.
The baptism of repentance symbolises understanding the spirit of the law by obeying, if there is error correcting.
The objective is to ensure that the heart is right.
Now because the heart was right immediately, Jesus received the Holy Spirit immediately.
For sinful people, they would usually go away and obey the law true to heart.
When the heart is right with God, it is truthful and 'sorry' and wants forgiveness, and in this state the heart is True. The person with a truthful heart then asks for forgiveness and the Holy Spirit comes.
The Holy Spirit was still in Jesus, as can be in us.

* How to pray
Lets just say you are praying for the release of oppression from poverty.
How then do you make a spotless prayer request?

The circumstances may be this:
- You can't seem to get the job you want
- You are underresourced, so can't escape poverty because lack of basic needs

Initially, you may pray like this:
- Lord God, I can't bare this anymore. I don't have what I need. Please provide for me. Amen.

However, this may not be entirely truthful.
Prayer requests must be truthful, I think, to be considered spotless, for you to get a response.

OK, so what is not truthful about it?

In your circumstances, you are holding out for the job you want.
So when praying to God, you should be like this:
- Lord God, I can't bare this anymore. I don't have what I need in order to get this type of job.
  I need this type of job because of X, Y, Z reasons. I realise I could get i, j, k types of jobs but I want this type.
  Please provide for me. Amen.

#+BEGIN_SRC text -n :async :results verbatim code
  3 If anyone teaches otherwise and does not agree to the sound instruction of
  our Lord Jesus Christ and to godly teaching, 4 they are conceited and
  understand nothing. They have an unhealthy interest in controversies and

  suspicions 5 and constant friction between people of corrupt mind, who have
  been robbed of the truth and who think that godliness is a means to financial
  gain.

The apostle Paul also says things prosperity preachers would like to ignore. He
warns Timothy against people who are “depraved in mind and deprived of the
truth, [who imagine] godliness is a means of gain” (1 Tim. 6:5).

I can’t think of a better description of prosperity gospel preachers. They’re
depraved in mind and view godliness as a means to one thing—wealth. Since
they’re not chiefly interested in the salvation of souls, they have lost the
content of the true gospel. All they seem to want is money.

* If I had a lot of money
- I would look for people to do the things I cannot do
  - And hire them to do it

Such things:
- Dedicate their life to moralising
- Dedicate their life to reforming the church
- Dedicate their life to mere focusing their mind and thought on important issues which others cannot do because:
  - Either all their time is spent on:
    - spouse
    - job
    - children
- Dedicate their life to thinking about the future of programming, employment, etc.

** How would I find such people?
They wolud have to be:
- diligent

- basically celibate
  - This almost proves that they are going to be diligent

Honestly, I think there is a curse that I am battling.
It's spiritual, I think.
I don't really trust Dad.

- I don't know if he is saved

  - I feel like I should stop giving him money only because it is not right that we should not have food in the house

However, pouring life into this pulls me away from focusing on God.

It's OK to consider such things.

* I have to avoid sinful thoughts
- They progress into worse things

** Also, if I keep my mind and body clean, I can justify strongly everything that I do
For example, I can defend things such as:
- Dating Melee

- A sinful person doesn't consider this

* Relationships
Christian marriage.

People should not be single if they cannot keep themselves from passion and
lust.

Apparently, if a person can keep themself from all lust then they should choose
celibacy so they can focus on God.

I have to also decide.

I do not choose marriage out of self-centeredness.
I choose it because I love Megan and want to take care of her.
She's a good choice because I can love Megan and serve God at the same time.

* Why reading
Think about *why* I am seeking this spiritual knowledge through the apocrypha.
I'm not doing this just so I can marry Megan - Oh no.
It's far more important that I learn this stuff.

Now obedience of commands is great, but there is a different calling now.
We must be obedient yes, but obedient to Christ's law.
Now when deing any good deed, it must be done genuinely from the heart.

* Do Not Hold Back on Speaking what is Right
Jesus said, "Men must give an account of every good word which they Shall not speak."

* Jesus said, "The weak shall be saved through the strong."

* Because Jesus was perfect, when He died and was judged, the punishment we gave Him wasn't the judgement
God the Father's judgement went onto Jesus for sure and He was judged.

I think of the 'negative image' or conjugate in terms of the truth table of
Jesus being taken after passing through the divine scales, and with perfect
identity, Jesus came out the same, or survived the Father's judgement.

Perhaps we all have to pass though this. I guess we are all relying on Jesus'
spirit and blood sacrifice for our atonement and and are relying on the believe
of salvation through Jesus.

Jesus *is* the Way, the Truth and the Life, and we have to come to the Father
through Jesus.

Now, I need to get to the bottom of this.

I'm not satified with 'belief', because belief can be any manner of shallow.

Remember that you are only passing through this world, not committed to this

* Non-rooted vine
Jesus said: A vine has been planted outside of the Father; and since it is not
established, it will be plucked out with its roots (and) will perish.

** First interpretation: Kingdom of God vs Kingdom of flesh, or false Kingdom of God (inside us)
The spiritual interpretation is that the concept of individual identity which
our culture imposes on each of us, being illusory, will be destroyed, either at
our physical death or at the experience of enlightenment as to our own true
nature which comes to those who are determined enough to understand the central
point of the Gospel of Thomas.

** Question: Is this salvation by belief? I think it is.

http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/thomas/gospelthomas40.html

The real-world interpretation relates to the destiny of the popular-based
organized Christian religion. It is too shocking to be publicly stated.

They have not entered and they have not allowed those who wish to enter to do so.

His disciples said: On what day will you be revealed to us, and on what day

(and) trample on them, then [you will see] the Son of the Living One, and you
will not be afraid.

* It is not possible for someone to enter into the house of the strong man and forcibly take his things
The strong man is someone who has reinforced their mind and spirit in the image of God.

If the man's hands are bound, he can loot his house.
The man is bound by things that have mastered him.
Addictions, sin of all kinds.
These things are recepticles for deception and manipulation.

* If a blind man leads a blind man they will both fall into a pit

* What you hear in your ears, both of them, your are to speak about from the rooftops

anyone who enters and goes out will see its light.

* Is it possible that we have the responsibility to share the good news of Jesus alongside with laxed responsibility with regard to keeping mosaic law, for example
- God's commandments/divine law perhaps was always the same
  - But alongside being told we are free from the mosaic law, we are told to preach the good news

So is it even right in this day and age to live in isolation?
I don't think it's right.
We're supposed to be set apart, pure and holy, sure.
But negating our duty to share with others? I think not.
But I also don't want to be tempted to destroy this heart which God has given me.

** I agree with this. We are supposed to put the LORD into our heart, and then actively search
We're not supposed to just wait around.
We're supposed to be confident, etc.

“Delight yourself in the LORD and he will give you the desires of your heart”
(Psalm 37:4).

Delighting in the Lord means we find pleasure in knowing Him and
trusting that He will delight us in return. He will put His desires into our
hearts. In the context of seeking a spouse, that means desiring for ourselves
the type of spouse He desires for us and who He knows will delight us further.

Proverbs 3:6 tells us, “In all your ways acknowledge him, and he will make
your paths straight.”

* Society
** Forces
- discrimination
- wokeness (anti-discrimination)
- cancel-culture (social policing)

*** Discrimination
Discrimination takes place.
It results in an emergent cancel-culture.

*** Wokeness
I don't think wokeness is wrong inherently.
Making people aware to discrimination is OK.

It counters discrimination, which is fine.

Some people get carried away with wokeness and produce a cancel-culture.

*** Cancel-culture
This is just social justice / policing, which silences voices.

** The problems with social forces
It's all material and false.

- People who discriminate do it without knowing who people are on the inside.
- People who push for wokeness callout discrimination where there was often no malicious intent.

*** The solution
Love thy neighbour as thyself.

But it's basically impossible to transform the world into Heaven.
So what then?

* It's possible that the Gnostics worked around the 'make the outside like the inside', by ADDING 'and make the inside like the outside'

Because the good news of the gospel actually say something like this:
- While on Earth, we come into knowledge of God
- We become something like gods in the afterlife

Now, who wouldn't want that?

** Can I have so much confidencee in my beliefs that I would share them with anyone?

* If I don't marry Megan soon then things will change extremely rapidly
I'm quickly becoming a different person.

* Stay away from evil stuff
- I should keep my eyes on Jesus and Truth
  - Actually do as Jesus says
    - Firstly by the 4 canonical gospels
    - Then perhaps with other ones, but only later

* Lord God
** Please protect my innocence
** Please protect me from my own evil desires
** Please use the knowledge I have for good, not evil
** Please lead me out of temptation
There's things out there which change my own spirit.
Knowledge, which I don't want to know, or let defile my spirit.

* Read my Bible more
- Spend time reading it
- Recognise that time is not infinite and it is possible to delve too far into spiritual knowledge
  - Without putting things into action

However, clean the inside and the outside will be cleaned.

It seems to better explain what it means to look to Heaven (afterlife), and how

* The Gospel of Mary is quite interesting
It seems to describe what it's like to die and face the evil aeons which try to imprison a soul.

* Vision and not wavering
- treasure is in the mind
  - Yeah, perhaps we understand and remember things with our minds
    - This is treasure
  - I guess literally that all things which are not good I will lose
    - Does that mean most of my memories are purged of corruption and so not much is left of those memories?

  “Peter said to Mary, "Sister, we know that the Saviour loved you more than the rest of women. Tell us the words of the Saviour which you remember - which you know (but) we do not, nor have we heard them." Mary answered and said, "What is hidden from you I will proclaim to you." And she began to speak to them these words: "I," she said, "I saw the Lord in a vision and I said to him, 'Lord, I saw you today in a vision.' He answered and said to me, 'Blessed are you that you did not waver at the sight of me. For where the mind is, there is the treasure.' I said to him, 'Lord, how does he who sees the vision see it through the soul or through the spirit?' The Saviour answered and said, 'He does not see through the soul nor through the spirit, but the mind which [is] between the two - that is [what] sees the vision...'
#+END_SRC

The mind is between the soul and spirit.
The mind sees the vision.
OK, sure.
SO what is the soul?

Spirit
Mind
Soul

Sure, spirit is at the base of the mind.

What does that mean?

- Seeking Truth
- Asserting poverty and reliance of our Saviour
- Seeking the Kingdom of God

* I actually like this

* What is ethical?
- 

Ethics actually are a way of conducting oneself based on the elimination of
things such as jealousy.

** Therefore, figure out what is considered bad
- Earthly things

In the case of jealousy, consider the types of things a person can be jealous
of, then engineer society to forbid over-indulgence, to minimise things which
cause jealousy.

*** Then find out what types of behaviours

** With regards to Gnostic Christianity
Spiritual things:
- Put to death jealousy

* Kingdoms
- Kingdom of the flesh
- Kingdom of God
- Kingdom of Heaven

Are KOG and KOH the same?

* Secret knowledge

- Think of Super Mario
  - Hidden areas

** There's also secret knowledge in life
For example, knowledge of God (e.g. understanding from experience of who God is).

* Communication
** I think that when communicating for others, words matter
** I think that when communicating for God, heart matters
Thought only matters, I think for helping to get into the right heart state.
Is the heart state merely love?

* I think I don't even want a wedding with anyone
I don't want a fake wedding.
I don't want anything which is fake.
I don't think Megan is a fake person, mainly, but I think she's being indoctrinated into fakeness via anxiety.
If she only accepted me, then she would avoid a lot of disillusionment.
Megan could've been my dream.
If she were younger I would've married her in total contentedness

* Be very careful to remain separate from technology

* I would only date someone up to about 24.
Honestly, it's extremely frustrating.
Why would Megan sacrifice her early 20s?
I really liked her.
Insanity.
It pains me greatly.
In some sense though, she is right to wait for me.

* I might go for the clean-shaven look next Sunday, lol
Clean shaven, maybe a haircut.

* I am a slave to God alone

* I want to marry Megan
If I get the chance, talk to her.

** I think it would be great because our parents can meet each other
They may love each other.

** I want to marry Megan because I don't want her to lose heart

** I want to marry Megan because I love her
I want to commit to Megan over every temptation.

* I want to turn into a full-on Christian - on fire for God. But that would mean persecution
What do I mean by that?
If you *truly* follow Christ, then people will get angry with you.
It's hard.
I would have to even surpass R. C. Sprout.

That is essential.

** Do not become a slave to sin! Jesus said it!
I must not be a slave to virtual reality, or even detach myself from God by becoming a slave to the false self!

* What is sinful imagination?
It seems to me that imagination is very useful.
Can imagining that which is evil serve to safeguard from evil, so as to not be taken advantage of? Yes, but what do you mean evil?
See, there's a difference between

Why is it wrong?
- it's self-indulgent.
- it feeds the flesh

* I wonder
- Truth is true

What you love is true.
The world arbitrarily tells you it's right or wrong.
When it tells you it's right, count yourself as having an easy life.
When it tells you it's wrong, count yourself as persecuted.
However, what you love or enjoy may also be wrong, according to God.
The world arbitrarily tells you it's right or wrong.
When it tells you it's right, it rewards sin materially.
When it tells you it's wrong, .
You're not allowed to do it.
If you're true you risk persecution by the world.
It's not the world that has the right to judge.
It's not people that have the right to judge.
However, Divine Law exists.
Loving your neighbour as yourself exists.
Recognising God as King, Lord and Saviour is a reality.
Therefore, it's sinful still to conduct yourself in ways that are sinful.
Sin is not what man dictates as wrong.
Sin is what God dictates as wrong.

* Pray to God
** Please help me to have a pure mind and soul, and be satisfied with that

** Please God, help me to love you better, and selflessly.

  - Faithfulness to your wife is a type of innocence
- Would people cease to believe in a higher power if they went all-in on sin?
  - Would it remain undeniable?
- Are Christian morals outdated?

* Megan
** In some sense I'm a slave to sin
- But I need Megan to help me by marrying me, because I don't think I can do it alone
  - It's a no-brainer.
    - I can't do it alone
- I should try to be more like Jesus and try to not be a slave to sin

** It's probable that she wont be mature enough to get past her anxiety of dating
- She might skip dating altogether and go to marriage
  - How fun it would be to spend time with Megan at this time

** I could tell Megan
This is how it happened:
I crushed on you. I chose from then on to love you.
And I decided I would be faithful to what I said because it was actually true.
Sure, I found you prettiest when you were younger.
But you're still extremely pretty.
I know for a fact there would be heaps of girls out there who would jump for a chance with me.
But I don't have the temptation because I haven't allowed myself to become tempted.
I still have most of my innocence.
You probably think a whole lot of things about me which are untrue.
I bet you think I've been with heaps of girls before.
I haven't.
I'm almost a virgin, if it matters for you.
I still understand why it matters that I keep my chastity, unlike virtually all guys you will meet.
It's a shame that one reason why we should *not* be together can't be overlooked for a thousand reasons why we should.

I think that the thing God requires of us now

  - That's what I should be doing

      - Well, yes.

  - Her needing me:
    - to pleasure her, for example
    - to be close at hand

You see, a guy needs to spearhead life somewhat, but needs support.
A guy needs to be supported emotionally.
She would have to be confident in me.

* If I can write a book on morality, I should be able to get any girl I want

with Megan which preserves her dignity?

I'm not sure if there *can* be.

If I spoke truthfully to her it would

Tell her:
- I can't do it alone

** Make it clear to her
- The only way we could be together is to have huge amounts of reconciling with each other with a huge amount of conversation.
  - We'd have to make promises to each other that we love each other enough to stick it out.

** When I think about talking to her, there might simply be too much to say now
- I am anxious that I can no longer talk to her, because it might affect her

* Nobody would ever want to hear something that is a falsehood
Therefore, I have to be truthful, when spreading philosophy.

There is no cheating!

* I'm not going to feel anxious about the type of girls I'm attracted to
But I can still work to minimise time wasted away from, or not considering the Lord's needs.

* I'm going to ask Megan one more time, but seriously this time
I want to have a conversation with her about her own happiness.
If she says yes, I will oblige.

* Anyone would know that an older guy such as myself would *love* a younger girlfriend *19*, say.
So they would *know* that I would stick with her, and bend over backwards for them.
Yet it's so strongly discouraged.
I could've said something lighthearted at YAs, when the 10 year old age gap thing was said.

I could've said, don't you think that an older
guy would be crazy to part with a hot young 19
year old girl, and wouldn't they bend over
backwards just to make them happy?

It's a lie that such a relationship would always have problems.

Isn't all that matters in terms of normal considerations that they think each other are hot?

** For Christians there is also additional consideration with regards to the morality of taking innocence
The problem with taking innocence is that it
makes people more carnal (body oriented, instead of spirit and truth).

Strictly speaking, though what may be
considered 'taking innocence' may not be that
in actual fact.

So it's important to think about what is
innocence and how it can be innocently or
guiltily taken.

It happens upon interaction, and may not be a sexual thing at all.

For example

| Dimension | Innocent | Guilty                                                        | Example         |
|-----------+----------+---------------------------------------------------------------+-----------------|
| Reliance  |          | Make the person reliant on something they were not reliant on | Sex, vape, etc. |

Can there be innocent interaction with people of largely differing ages?
I think so, but there 

** Innocence
It is largely unavoidable to take innocence
when there is interest from a more innocent
person to a less innocent person, for example
an interaction between two people of largely
differing ages, where the younger is
influenced by the older.

*** Ways to avoid guilt when taking innocence
- Commitment
  - Don't 

* I should make a religion around prioritising reality over fiction
Things which are fictional, under this religion, should be limited.

** Then reality must be defined well

* I could go to church dressed in my velvet coat if I want
It doesn't matter.
I want a girlfriend.

* Megan is actually overdue by 24 - She's still OK, I guess.
I'm so sick of this.
I want a younger girlfriend.
What age is she? 23 going on 24 I'm quite sure, but it *may* be 25.
She's really pushing the limit for me since I'm attracted to much younger.
Still technically within the limit.
I say this in truth.
I will only respond probably if she says she needs me, and she would have to be dead honest about it.
How long have I waited?
Sure, in the past I was more innocent and could've deliberately gone for younger women, but I have never liked a girl above 24.
This is the fact.

** I am going to ask her one more time. Ugh. I will ask her again, because I'm still interested - that is the fact
I'll ask her again.
I should not be afraid to ask her.
She might say no.
If she says no I will respect it completely.

* I should absolutely meet someone new and date them if there is an opportunity
But in order to do this, I need to first do a whole lot of writing.

It *is* possible to be in the same place with someone younger, but not consistently.

and it's actually extremely *hot* to be with someone more innocent than yourself.

Innocence, however, is a pretty serious thing to mess with for someone.
Like I think it's sinful to destroy innocence.
But the loss of innocence seems to be a reality in this life.

* Two types of truth
Is something more true when it's discovered by true interpretation. Or is it more true if it's said as reality.
For example if I said Melee is the 🍓 of my life.
Is it better than innate truth because people are forced to judge what it is based on perceivable characteristics of the relationship.
I think it's true, from that perspective.
Is integrity of word more important than integrity of spirit/self? Possibly.
I don't want to discredit the absolute truth of happiness with Melee -- that was amazing.
Melee gave me absolute bliss, happiness, and excitement.
Megan, on the other hand, reciprocated nothing but I feel like it's my duty to tell her I love her, and get a buzz from that.
A bit like the nicotine buzz, in that it's gone down a bit, but it's still true.

+ There's two types of truth:
  - Innate Truth
    - innocent - it just is true, spiritually perhaps
    - spiritually
      - from here, it's important to make body conform to spirit
  - Simulated Truth
    - duck-typing - if it waddles like a duck, quacks like a duck, it is a duck
      - it's possible that spirit may come into being from body
    - physically, mind, body

* Lies are a lot like misdirection
** Is simulation of truth acceptable?
A person may simulate truth, ask for forgiveness.
Does that work?

What if a lie becomes truth through simulation. Is it possible?
It might not be, but as a consequence, we have to live with that lie our whole life.

** Is it possible to truly forget sin, or does it have permanent damage on a person?
I think it might have permanent damage.

* Is there any truth at all to say the human sacrifice of the religions of ancient meso-american civilizations?
Under the guise of a completely false mythology, is there any truth?

The only underlying thing is sacrifice/'grace'.

** Does this do any damage to the idea of Jesus' sacrifice?

* If I become so sure about Megan then I will be compelled again to tell her
If I am 100% truthful then I *must* act. That's my only ticket.
What's in the way?
In a sense, Melee is in the way.

* Megan is cute and it's possible she simply doesn't understand, is and was not ready for me
- Still, it's true that the part of the
  relationship which is concerned with things
  like sex was destroyed in waiting.

Is it right or wrong?

* It's extremely important to write about myself
I might see that movies externally talk about
certain things such as encountering your
greatest fears, or defining what is right or
wrong.

- Consider Top Gun: Maverick
- Consider MI: Dead Reckoning

I want to do them for myself first.

But it's dangerous. I haven't chosen yet and I could be rashly choosing.

God is faithful to speak to you — but His voice can often be heard only by what
you sense in your own heart. If you sense peace in your heart, it could be the
Holy Spirit telling you, “You have a green light, so you can proceed.” But if
you have a lack of peace or an inward disturbance, never forget that it could
be God’s way of saying “Yellow light, so proceed with caution.” Or He may even
be telling you, “Red alert! Stop! Something is wrong!”

Don’t make the mistake I made many years ago by ignoring that lack of peace in
your heart. It will be far better for you if you take a little time to back up,
slow down, and find out why you’re feeling uneasy on the inside. If you find
that everything is all right, you will then be able to move forward with
assurance. But if you learn that something is not right, you’ll be so thankful
that you listened to your heart and got things in order before you proceeded
any further and damage was done!

* The Holy Spirit I think grieves in me when I see such things
[[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apzXGEbZht0][Still Face Experiment: Dr. Edward Tronick - YouTube]]

Now is the Holy Spirit's reaction an indication of my own sin?
Perhaps grief comes from my own soul which has been fixed by Jesus's blood and united with Holy Spirit.
Therefore, surely some things 
Can I even detect sin?
I think sin may be detected by conviction and knowledge that the soul has.

** It might be the case right now that I have to follow the threads of what is love and sin, instead of truth
For that reason, I should be fine without this feeling of feeling truthful.
But I am working on something else right now.
I will try to restore that later.

It will help with wisdom.

It's probably important that I start learning to do that, so I am ready.

** This is what I believe re: Holy Spirit
We go through times when we can prove to God that we have faith.
This is a good thing.
Other times we are absolutely convinced we are in God's favour.

SIN will always create a barrier between us and God and needs repentence to restore the broken fellowship (1 John 1:8–9)

Remember the lady at church who was vaping outside and also has asthma.

Lord God please help that lady to quit vaping.

#+BEGIN_SRC text -n :async :results verbatim code
  Cilia are antennae-like protuberances that are present on 50 percent to 75
  percent of the cells that line human airways. They play a key role in keeping
  the human airway clear of mucus and dirt and allow people to breathe easily and
  without irritation. Impaired cilia function has been linked to lung diseases
  such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and asthma.
  
  “Although chemicals used to flavor e-cigs are frequently used, little has been
  known about the mechanism of how they impact health. Our new study suggests
  that these chemicals may be harming cilia — the first line of defense in the
  lungs — by altering gene expression related to cilia production and function,”
  said Quan Lu, associate professor of environmental genetics and
  pathophysiology. Lu and Joseph Allen, assistant professor of exposure
  assessment science, are co-senior authors of the study.

* Wisdom (for others)
** Never push on a front where you don't have selfless love
- For example, with Melee
  - I might say that I felt like I was righteous to push on that front, but it wasn't selfless
    - It wasn't selfless because she's too young to 'need me'.
    - I think back and I had thought that she did kind-of need me.
      - Maybe that's a simulation of selfless-love, but maybe it's not 'true' selfless love
        - True selfless love I think exists without the simulation of it.
        - For example, true selfless love may sound selfish, but it's not; It's just a reality.
          - A person loves another for no reason (i.e. the love doesn't come from reason. Rather reason, if exists, has been simulated from love).
        - True selfless love may come into conception from an innocent situation, a bind is made and leaving that person hurts.
          - It pulls you back rather than you pull it.
- With Megan
  - The selfless love was more like a simple 

* I have to realise that my own personal experience of God is unique, yes, and others will have different ones
I should not brag about my own.
I still have insecurities, which I need to deal with.

Such as:
- Have I committed unforgivable sin?
- Has God left me?
- Can I get back to the point where I have a truthful spirit?
- Can I get back to the point where I'm full of faith?
  - I want to. I really want to :)
  - I should crucify the body so I can! This is what I should aim for!

Or introspecting about the nature of soul, or God.

Do you find it tempting to go down the rabbit-hole of learning about surrealistic art, the methodology of doing it, etc.
Or tempting to pursue relationships to meet

For example, the Kingdom of God, astral projection and the like.

* Is love based on truth or is truth based on love? The greatest is love.
If love is the combination of joy (natural product of peace), peace (agreeance, contentedness), etc.
And truth is what? Truth might be when you test these things in your heart.
Is it true that you love?

* Is it possible to love someone purely spiritually, without seeing them physically?
Spirit is love and truth.

Love and truth can both become defiled.

Is it possible to love someone purely spiritually, without seeing them
physically? Yes, until you destroy the reality of that. Like eating of the
fruit of good an evil; One knows it's a reality that they themselves love
another without reason, but seek to test it and in doing so lose it.
It may be that it's an internal reality.

We're headed for this virtual reality shit.

What do people really love? Do people love while they innocently have not philosophised on what is love? Yes, love is a reality.
Does love exist without knowledge of it? Yes. Only a defiled person says that a child does not love.

Do people love the person's personality or do they love the person? I can just make something to imitate a person.
Lets just say I made an AI of an actual person you love, preserved in youth, innocence and beauty.
Would you accept the gift of this 'immortal' AI in exchange for letting the real person go?
If a person is in love with a personality, then they are a walking corpse. They exchange personal immortality for the immortality of an AI.
Everything they love is a fiction. If they breathe life to the fiction they themselves become fictional and will kill their own spirit.
You have to be honest with yourself.
Who do you love right now?
The reality is what is true and real.
Only the reality is real.
You might have discovered that you can get someone better. But that isn't the reality of who you love.

10 these things God has revealed to us through the Spirit; for the Spirit
searches everything, even the depths of God. 11 For what human being knows what
is truly human except the human spirit that is within? So also no one
comprehends what is truly God’s except the Spirit of God. 12 Now we have
received not the spirit of the world, but the Spirit that is from God, so that
we may understand the gifts bestowed on us by God. 13And we speak of these
things in words not taught by human wisdom but taught by the Spirit,
interpreting spiritual things to those who are spiritual.

* The third astral projection is God the Father, or something like it maybe

* God the Father is love

** One of God's attributes is Truth, another is Love
But *is* God Truth and *is* God Love?

I think Absolute Love is similar to Absolute Truth
in that a person's Truth is part of Absolute Truth.

But Love is a bit different, isn't it.
A person's Love *might* be a part of Absolute Love.

In some sense, I consider Love and Truth to be the same thing.
If you think about it, what gives you joy? To feel loved.

Personally, I think of God in this way.

It partially feels like it's meaningless.

It's still true, but only if she looks at me.
Only if she comes to me.

* Integrity
- Ruthless consistency

** Integrity of word
- Promises to others
- Consistent presentation so as not to confuse, even if this means consistenly undefinable

** Integrity of personal truth
- Knowing yourself

** Integrity towards God
- Personal relationship - nothing to do with others
  - What you are forgiven for and are not convicted of / guilty of
  - The promises you make to God
  - Integrity of word/heart towards God

* So Megan looked at me today as she was walking past.
She was wearing a dark blue dress with small white dots I think.
She had her mask on so I could only see the top of her face, but I knew it was her.

Apparently that makes it hard to get a young girl as wife/girlfriend.

If I could choose between one of them it would be Melee 100%.
When I think of fucking her or anything like that, it feels natural and good.
I don't even think I could imagine being with Megan again.
I should almost just avoid Megan entirely.

Simply be someone with the keys.

I think it's for more spiritual than that.

Law points to God's character.
Knowledge of God's character and our own character allows us to perceive what is sinful.
Sin generally defiles.
Identify what is being defiled when you sin.
It's nothing to do with arbitrary man-made law and sexual orientation or preference.
In fact, I think God's character is more about unity, and genuine saving of people.
Freeing people from guilt.
That does not merely mean guilt from previous sin.
I think it means vindicating a person's nature.

      - I don't understand this
      - There *are* some things I do wrong. But I'm not convicted that many of the things which are said to be wrong are actually wrong.

* I think what is evil is gratification and increasing defilement
I think *thinking* about whatever is already known is not actually very sinful.

** So what you do is acknowledge Jesus as the saviour of your uniqueness
And you do not grieve the holy spirit by moving further away from that.
You think about what is true to you and how you are saved as you are.
And you can imagine all you want surrounding that -- it doesn't really harm your spirit much at all.
This heals over time.

* Is sex evil?
I don't think it is.
Christianity makes it out to be.

** Is pornography evil?
New pornography is probably more evil than going over old stuff.
Surely not intrinsically, especially if within marriage.
However, even this may keep a person from denying their own flesh.
But perhaps we can use such urges in a constructive way somehow.
By giving life to things which deserve it.
We propagate truth and give life to things which we allow to become part of our truth.
But we have to be part of the branches. We still have to be made of truth.
Is it giving life to corruption?
Perhaps we become part of the world we give life to?
Do we have any control over our realities?
What of faith?

** Why would physical intimacy be evil? Shouldn't something based in reality be less evil than something fake like pornography?
Surely it is not evil.

** Is sexual intercourse outside marriage evil?
Maybe.
Maybe it is not.

** What is the root of the evil?
Self-indulgence?
Is there actually any evil in simply dealing with the urge and moving on?
Surely not.
Well, once moving on what happens?
What is overcoming sin?

The Eastern Orthodox Church or Orthodox Christian Church views sexuality as a
gift from God that finds its fulfillment in the marital relationship, and
therefore the misuse of the gift of human sexuality is sinful. Because the act
of masturbation is self-directed, and by its nature is incapable of expressing
love and concern for another person, it is viewed as a distortion of the use of
the gift of sexuality. This is especially apparent when masturbation becomes an
addiction. In the least, the practice of self-pleasure is viewed as not
honoring the purpose of God's gift of sexuality.[35]

The sexual sins of fornication, adultery and masturbation, as well as hatred,
jealousy, drunkenness and other sins are considered to be sins of the heart as
much as the body. It is thought that turning away from sexual sin is turning
away from self-indulgence for the purpose of self gratification. Instead of
turning to the desires of the flesh, the Orthodox Christian turns to the Holy
Spirit, whose fruit is believed to be love, joy, peace, patience, kindness,
goodness, faithfulness, gentleness and self-control

* If Christianity encourages the destruction of the sexual self...
Is it self-destructive?
Is it life-giving?
Is it truthful?
Is it evil?
Should I be seeking eternal life?
Is eternal life already gained?
What is the nature of self in heaven?
Is Christianity flat-out evil?
Is it truthful?

* What is sin?
** Distinguishing good from evil
Hebrews 5:14 ESV
But solid food is for the mature, for those who have their powers of discernment trained by constant practice to distinguish good from evil.

** Never avenge yourselves
Romans 12:19 ESV
Beloved, never avenge yourselves, but leave it to the wrath of God, for it is written, “Vengeance is mine, I will repay, says the Lord.”

** When a person is developing their faith, perhaps the only way is to put to death the desires of the flesh
When Paul talks about this, I think the real issue is 'desires of the flesh', not sexuality.
Holding onto the things of the world and loving the world instead of trying to bolster truth within your own spirit.

** Keep oneself unstained from the world
James 1:27 ESV / 13 helpful votes 
Religion that is pure and undefiled before God, the Father, is this: to visit orphans and widows in their affliction, and to keep oneself unstained from the world.

** Those that are weak in faith, do not quarrel over opinions
Romans 14:1 ESV / 13 helpful votes 
As for the one who is weak in faith, welcome him, but not to quarrel over opinions.

A person needs to build up faith for a person.
Therefore, if they are weak but at the base, you want to add more truth to them.

** There is sin that does not lead to death
1 John 5:17 ESV / 17 helpful votes Helpful Not Helpful
All wrongdoing is sin, but there is sin that does not lead to death.

Not all sin is equal.
It's possible that my body is an absolute writeoff, but I must keep my spirit true.
It's the only way.

Apparently, hating the world is basically walking by the spirit.

** And there is sin that does lead to death

James 4:17 ESV / 68 helpful votes Helpful Not Helpful
So whoever knows the right thing to do and fails to do it, for him it is sin.

So it's a sin when you *know* what the right thing is.
This is about failing to do the right thing.

When it comes to doing what is right, it might be what others regard as sinful.
For example, healing on the sabbath.
But what about hooking up with someone you love.

** I'm sick to shit about the Bible's war against love and peace
It's bullshit.
Who the fuck wrote all that shit?

If you do not *know* what the right thing is, then it's not sin.

* I am not a liar
** Love in its different forms are mixed. There's no avoiding sin

* Perhaps my physical body will die because it's so full of sin
** I have to maintain a spirit of truth

* A ravenous wolf is someone who inside is full of lies and deceit, and on the outside they clothe themself in sheeps clothing
** A sheep may be the opposite
I know that I am a sheep and not a wolf.
I know that even if I sin externally, I have a truthful, non-deceitful spirit.

* I'm going to remain truthful, and I'm going to do my best to be faithful
It's the best I can do.

Being truthful is something anyone can do.
Being faithful is tougher - it's trusting in truth - whether that be our truth or someone else's truth.
If we take on the spirit of truth then we can trust in our own truth - if we ourselves are truthful.
We can increase our spirit of truth (which might be actually the substance of spirit itself) by discovering more universal spiritual truth.
That is discovering more love and peace, etc.

Being faithful to someone is understanding their truth and trusting on it, following it, and seeking peace with it and empathising with them so that their joy gives joy to you.
Being faithful to yourself is taking one's own truth and trusting on it, giving joy to you and inner peace. Because one's own truth is hard to maintain sometimes.
Being faithful to the world is not contradicting your own truth when engaging with the world - it's having integrity with regards to your inner truth and connection to the world

So we have to firstly find God's truth in our own truth.
- We find peace with others within ourself. That's God's Truth and we become more like Jesus when we do this.
  - But what is the sword we are supposed to wield? It doesn't bring peace but division.
So we have to try to make God's truth into our own truth.
So then there is no conflict with being faithful.

** Peace
https://biblehub.com/bsb/matthew/10.htm

Not peace but a sword.
It brings peace within the heart and within God.
But physical peace it does not bring.

* I think that spirit is something real
Spiritual state is real.
Spiritually, there has to be acceptance of Jesus as Saviour.
Guilt is removed this way.
It's more than merely placing Jesus in the beliefs system.
The beliefs system is physical.
Mind is physical.
Spirit is not physical, it's transcendent.
Someone must have their spirit fixed and saved -- That's what I believe it means to be saved.
Someone's spirit becomes truthful and part of God.
In that instance it becomes.

The goal should be to help turn people into branches of truth for the kingdom of God

** So where have I gone wrong?
Why do I feel guilt?
Perhaps it's because I did not extend grace to others.
I need to repent of this.
I think that my own truthfulness means that I am some kind of branch on which others can perch.
If I do not extend that to others then what?
Can people be saved if they are not truthful?
I have to be a branch of truth, on which others spiritually may find rest.
OK, so Jesus did it first.
We then become spiritual branches.
Others look to us, spiritually for rest, for truth.

* Everybody has 'sin'
Sin is rebellion.
Sin is spiritual, not physical.
Sin is bought by the death of Jesus.

https://fitchburgstate.libguides.com/c.php?g=1046516&p=7602969

* The purchase happens like this
We love certain things. We love things which may be sinful objectively.
God bought us to make us into truth.

* I hate discrimination and prejudice. God is love and truth
Truth is personal - By far the most important thing with regards to knowing God
is to live in love and truth.

External truth is formally a lie if it does not line up with personal truth.

God's truth reveals truth we didn't know, and is compatible with personal truth.
It's light and enlightening when received.
It's not darkness. When received it doesn't hide personal truth.
Darkness casts a shadow over your personal truth. It hides you.
Light reveals who you are and removes anxiety.

* 9 Fruit of the Holy Spirit
1.  Love
    1 John 4:8 He that loveth not knoweth not God, for God is love.

    Mark 12:29-30 “The most important one,” answered Jesus, “is this: ‘Hear, O
    Israel: The Lord our God, the Lord is one.[e] 30 Love the Lord your God
    with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind and with
    all your strength.’

    The Lord is one.

    Leviticus 19:18 "You shall not take vengeance or bear a grudge against any
    of your people, but you shall love your neighbor as yourself: I am the
    Lord."

    Mark 12:31 Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself. There is no other
    commandment greater than these.

    Basically, we become like God when we show love to oneanother.
    It's as simple as that really.

    We are supposed to become love.

2.  Joy
    True joy comes from knowing they are truthful.
    And from knowing that their belief in God is true.

    - Insecure people do not have joy.

3.  Peace
    Peace that passes all understanding
    - This means truth in the spirit. When the spirit is made of truth you feel peace and rest.
    - Yes, it's below understanding, because it comes from the base of personal truth.
    - Keeps your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus.
    - Having this peace means you can't discriminate against people.
      - Someone who has the Holy Spirit in them doesn't discriminate. They make peace with people.
      - They are able to 

4.  Long Suffering

5.  Kindness

6.  Goodness

7.  Faith 
    Faith is trust in truth that it will remain true.

8.  Gentleness

9.  Temperance
    Self-control. Self-mastery. The ability to refrain from things which rob of joy.
    This means not allowing sinful things to control us.
    I don't think it means abandonning all things that bring us happiness - things that would be considered sinful by some people.
    I think it means avoiding traps.
    I think it means wisdom.

** Do I have these?

* It is of my opinion that
- Sin which does not harm others is far lesser sin.
  - Things like pornography
  - Even still, there is a small amount of innocence in pornography
- There is also sin which defile a person's self and make the person less in control and less truthful

** Pornography is a crutch and is helpful to ease passion
However, you cheat yourself out of something.
You cheat yourself out of knowing 

** Personal sin of self is a condition
When we have a truthful spirit inside us, it becomes much easier to resist personal sin, temptation, things we turned from.

* What is more sinful?
- crossdressing (completely innocent, children do it)
- homosexual relationships
- pseudo-heterosexual relationship with a machine

** What are the lies and truth in each
Truth is androgenous and doesn't care.

** What is innocence?
Innocence doesn't know that something is wrong.

** God's law is about finding innocence and truth again
It really is about guilt/innocence and lie/Truth.

Exodus 20:7 reads: Thou shalt not take the name of the LORD thy God in vain;
for the LORD will not hold him guiltless that taketh his name in vain.

Invoking God's name in an oath was considered a guarantee of the truth of a
statement or promise.

- No other Gods before me
  - Lose innocence when people come under slavery from someone or something
  - When people forget that God exists
- Not make unto thee any graven images
  - Lose innocence when people diminish their understanding of God
- Do not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain
  - Lose innocence when people think they can
- Remember the sabbath day and keep it Holy
  - keep the Sabbath day to worship, remember creation, and rest so we could serve God and others.  
  - Factor in God into everything
- Honor your father and mother
  - I think this is about fitting into the tapestry
    - You have to be able to honor where you came from
    - You also have to be able to honor where you came from spiritually, mentally
      - The journey for each person is different. Their idea of Saviour is different.
- Thou shalt not kill
  - We are not supposed to kill
    - Do not kill ideologies
    - Do not kill people and their spiritual identities
      - Not just physical. Do not kill their spirits either. You can do this by making them into false people
- Thou shall not commit adultery
  - This is about having integrity, and the next step beyond merely being truthful.
    - Integrity is about truth and faith. Faith is trust that truth continues to be true.
- Thou shalt not steal
  - Do not take away another's happiness - their prize lamb.
- Thou shall not bear false witness
  - Do not lie. Do not tell lies about yourself.
- You shall not covet
  - Do not covet
    - Imagine what you have. Do not covet that which you do not have.
      - "Everything is permissible for me"--but not everything is beneficial.
        "Everything is permissible for me"--but I will not be mastered by
        anything.
    - We have so called 'sinful vices'.
      - Are they actually sinful or do they belong to us - things which we have and keep us going without coveting?

** What are the similarities
- They are only offensive externally to other people
  - It's not a matter of the heart

* How to get the Holy Spirit living in you
** Become a truthful person - have a truthful heart
** Obtain a discerning spirit which can confidently challenge even religious teachings which for appearances sake condemn you
But having a truthful spirit means you do not feel condemned.
You see, God would not kill that which is innocent and truthful.

* I should make a blog article about this evil bit of religion

* There is no way I will view myself as a bad person for all the virtuous stuff I've done

Why do you deprive me of hope and life?
I am stoic just so I do not commit suicide because you deprive me of everything.
How can a person change when they have become stoic?
The only reason I harden my heart is to prevent any more hurt.
Yet no help arrives.
Also, I am condemned for sin I commit when I try to edify people.
Is it not possible to say anything in this world without condemnation?

** Alternatively, I will become a person like Paul
I will simply voice what I think and accept your judgement God, because at
least I did speak.

Also, your voice is magnified by me.
Speak God and I will be your amplifier.

Why do you be so silent to me?

I wait for a voice but I hear nothing.
Now I contemplate to see if doing so I can hear anything.

establishing a foundation to live my life.

- A foundation for prayer
- A foundation for discerning God's will
- A method for discerning God's will

** Bahá'í sin
Baháʼís consider humans to be naturally good,
fundamentally spiritual beings. Human beings
were created because of God's immeasurable
love for us. However, the Baháʼí teachings
compare the human heart to a mirror, which, if
turned away from the light of the sun (i.e.
God), is incapable of receiving God's love. It
is only by turning unto God that the spiritual
advancement can be made. In this sense,
"sinning" is to follow the inclinations of
one's own lower nature, to turn the mirror of
one's heart away from God. One of the main
hindrances to spiritual development is the
Baháʼí concept of the "insistent self" which
is a self-serving inclination within all
people. Baháʼís interpret this to be the true
meaning of Satan, often referred to in the
Baháʼí Writings as "the Evil One".

Watch over yourselves, for the Evil One is
lying in wait, ready to entrap you. Gird
yourselves against his wicked devices, and,
led by the light of the name of the All-Seeing
God, make your escape from the darkness that
surroundeth you. — Baháʼu'lláh

This lower nature in humans is symbolized as
Satan — the evil ego within us, not an evil
personality outside. — ʻAbdu'l-Bahá

*** This is OK, I guess
- I agree with a lot here

** Judaism sin
Judaism regards the violation of any of the 613 commandments as a sin. Judaism teaches that to sin is a part of life, since there is no perfect man and everyone has an inclination to do evil. Sin has many classifications and degrees, but the principal classification is that of "missing the mark" (cheit in Hebrew).[32] Some sins are punishable with death by the court, others with death by heaven, others with lashes, and others without such punishment, but no sins committed with willful intentions go without consequence. Sins committed out of lack of knowledge are not considered sins, since a sin cannot be a sin if the one who committed it did not know it was wrong. Unintentional sins are considered less severe sins.[33]

Sins between people are considered much more serious in Judaism than sins between man and God.

*** Why this is insane
- It's a form of control
- People are told they are evil, and so when they act out of good character, they are gaslighted into believing that acting out of good character is wrong.
  - Basically, it destroys innocence and trust.
  - You'll never enter the kingdom of heaven while you are guilty.
- It doesn't change the heart.
- It's nothing to do with God.

** Islamic Sin
Sin is an important concept in Islamic ethics. Muslims see sin as anything that goes against the commands of God (Allah), a breach of the laws and norms laid down by religion.[30] Islam teaches that sin is an act and not a state of being. It is believed that God weighs an individual's good deeds against his or her sins on the Day of Judgement and punishes those individuals who their evil deeds outweigh their good deeds. These individuals are thought to be sentenced to afterlife in the fires of jahannam (Hell).

Islamic terms for sin include dhanb and khaṭīʾa, which are synonymous and refer to intentional sins; khiṭʾ, which means simply a sin; and ithm, which is used for grave sins.

** Shinto sin
The Shinto concept of sin is inexorably linked to concepts of purity and pollution. Shinto does not have a concept of original sin, instead believing that all human beings are born pure.[38] Sin, also called Tsumi, is anything that makes people impure (i.e. anything that separates them from the kami).[39] However, Shinto does not believe this impurity is the result of human actions, but rather the result of evil spirits or other external factors.[38][39]

Sin can have a variety of consequences in Japan, including disaster and disease.[38][39] Because of this, purification rituals, or Harae, are viewed as important not just to the spiritual and physical health of the individual, but to the well-being of the nation.[38]

*** I think this is closer to truth
- People are born pure, sure, in that they have integrity

*** Why this is insane
- It's a form of control.
- It doesn't change the heart.
- It teaches that people are machines, nothing more, and truth can't be found in the heart.
- Can never be at peace.
- It teaches peace through domination of others.
- Many do not get peace.

* TODO I don't believe what some asshole said about what truth is
I have come to a better definition of what it is - a truthful definition.
A more intelligent definition.
I will not live in fear.
I will live in truth and honesty with God.
I will live in grace and salvation.
I will learn the truth of God by transcending sin entirely.
How can I learn what God is like if I do not steady my foundation?
How can I act like God if I do not learn to love and accept non-judgmentally?
I will not be deceived by false-integrity.
If I do that I forgo all truthful things.
I must be able to see myself as truthful, and act honestly.
I will not be a liar!
I will fight for truth.

** There is a lot of bullshit out there about what sin is
*** What actually hurts God?
Let's be honest.
God likes it when you're feeling innocent and righteous.
Does God just want to be feared?
Does God want to be loved?
Does God want us to be confused?

*** Is God hurt when you do something which is right for you?

*** Does God love it when you spread compassion and love instead of judgement?
Probably.

** TODO Make a diagram of where sin is and how we should deal with it
Take an analogy from simulacra and simulation.
Socially, we exist in a simulation.
Do we allow the simulation to tell us what is true?
The Bible can be subverted using a simulation to control the Bible.
Like redefining the words to give new meaning to the Bible, the Bible can be subverted.
Are we resistant to that?
Do we allow God to tell us what is true?
Do we allow ourselves a connection to God? How can it be obtained?
I think integrity and honesty provides that.

*** What about sin? What *is* sin at this stage?
I suppose it's not having integrity and perverting the spirit of Christ's law.

* Is a person without integrity even a christian? Can they even have hope in Jesus if they don't know who they are, and how they can't live up?

* I know for a fact that abstaining from sex etc. to form a relationship which is honorable, has led to death
** It has led to being in a situation where now relationships are considered wrong
How did that happen? All that happened was that I aged.
It is a false moral system.
I know what is true and I will *fight* against lies.
I will actually fight them from now on.
And I will explain why.
I will not become the victim of an arbitrary moral code.
I will fight such impending bullshit with war.
It's where repentance is not needed.

* Write about false integrity

* I must explain and expose the truth of a life spent in lies, deceit and false integrity

* When I see Dad, I do not see Jesus
I see a false person.

** I see a disgusting person, who prevents people from seeing the truth
Like many false-Christians.
They might as well be Jewish and under the Mosaic Law.
All things are lawful if they do not obstruct from learning about who God is, and being able to share the light of that.
If we picture God as a wrathful God without grace then we do not know God.
If we know God we spread that light to others.

*** What is the truth?
It's that people are loved for their own uniqueness.
The concept of humans being sinful against perfect truth is bullshit.
How can people possibly become that?
But we can become creatures of truth, and abide in the truth we understand and know.

*** Forcing someone to be like an archetype is bullshit
A person can't be that.

** I see someone who excludes others
I see someone who thinks everyone should conform to the same mold is almost the definition of evil.

** 

** Someone truly born again doesn't live in fear of sin
They just live honest and non-deceitful lives.

* Sin
Sin is lawlessness but sin now means law against love and non-judgement.
It's a different kind of law now.
Almost everything now is lawful.

"Everything is permissible for me"--but not
everything is beneficial. "Everything is
permissible for me"--but I will not be
mastered by anything. 

** What constitutes as sin now?
It's further destruction of your identity, in my opinion.
To have faith, you need a firm basis.
You need to arrive at a point of integrity and ground truth.
From there you can actually trust in God.
Once you become truth, then you trust in God by trusting in your own integrity.

* 
Hateful, self-righteous bigot, who is not
saved because your grace doesn't extend to
people who have different types of sin to
yourself.

Among the sinners, you're worse because you
don't value integrity.

I would rather a father who had integrity than
one who was bigoted.

* Like the bahai, it's important to be completely honest about spirituality
e:/home/shane/blog/posts/a-true-spirit.org

If you are honest, you are unafraid to write about it.
* A true spirit
A true spirit is an authentic human being.
Non-judgemental.
Respectful of divine law.
Seeking divine law.
Not merely blindly accepting what is told to them.

** Propagation of Grace
If a person has a true spirit then when they are given grace they naturally give it to others.
If a person doesn't propagate their grace then they probably haven't accepted grace themself and are in sin.
A person should forgive and be forgiven, not judge and not be judged, not tempt, and not feel guilty for being tempted.
A person should be the salt that teaches these principles.
If a person's grace doesn't extend to others' then they are going to Hell.

* Unless contradicted by God somehow, according to a revelation / vision from Him, I will not change my gospel
Why? Because there are too many hateful, ignorant, false people in this world.

* God has abandonned this world
God lets people die.

* TODO Make a metaphysical Christianity
Christianity minus the physical stuff.

* Lying is transcendental / metaphysical
* Sexual sin is not transcendental / metaphysical
* The spirit is transcendental
* The mind is not transendental
* Transformation of body and soul according to spirit is transcendental, when spirit exists
- But it's false an ineffective when spirit does not exist.

* Forgiveness
If you can't forgive then you wont be forgiven.
If you can't accept that people have different sin and it's part of their
nature and accept and forgive that then you won't be forgiven for your own.

* Paul was an asshole
He was a discriminating asshole before and after converting to Christianity.
He preached a false religion, I think.

* Immorality
Immorality is evil, sinful, or otherwise wrong behavior. Immorality is often
called wickedness and is a state avoided by good people. Since morality refers
to things that are right, immorality has to do with things that are wrong —
like stealing, lying, and murdering.

* Jesus' perspective on sin
- It's of the heart

* Dad's or Paul's perspective on sin
- It's of action, and nothing to do with the heart

They believe that the body must become a temple at the heart's expense and that
the kingdom of heaven occurs after death and not now.

They are part of the world and will die with it.
They know nothing of the spiritual part of it.
They are not made of spirit.
They needed visual confirmation.

* Why is adultery and 

* So many contradictions
But as for the cowards and unbelieving and abominable [who are devoid of
character and personal integrity and practice or tolerate immorality], and
murderers, and sorcerers [with intoxicating drugs], and idolaters and
occultists [who practice and teach false religions], and all the liars [who
knowingly deceive and twist truth], their part will be in the lake that blazes
with fire and brimstone, which is the second death.”

- Personal integrity
  - Yes, if a person has integrity and truth in them and know who they are and what they are saved from
    - Do they continue being themselves?
      - Yes or no? Hard to know.
        - I think Yes.

* Dad is a simpleton

* From now on until forever I will tell Dad he is going to Hell because he judges other people for being homosexual

* Paul the apostle's teachings are evil because
- It discourages people from seeking God
  - Because it condemns people for their nature / supposed sin
    - Rather than teaching people first what sin is

* A person should first learn what sin is from their own perspective
Need to construct a truth compass for themself.
Become an authentic person.

** Should try to improve the truth compass

* I'm very distrusting of Paul the apostle
- Homophobic
- Stoic
- Not imaginative

I don't like Paul.

* Did God save me or did God destroy me?
I was saved.
So do I now self destruct or do I build on top of this?
Do not self-destruct.
I have to not allow Paul's bullshit to creep into my beliefs system.
By beliefs system is primordial and vulnerable as it is.

** The next step is to consecrate the body, apparently
https://blog.biblesforamerica.org/im-saved-what-comes-next/

Is there any truth to this?
Whas is the male and female parts of a person?
Is it 2 spirits inside?
Is it body and spirit?

* Heart and imagination
** Imagination certainly has some effect on the heart
*** Are we supposed to have innocent imaginations?
Perhaps this is the best way to demonstrate a pure spirit.
*** Can we use imagination to purify heart?
How?
*** Is the imagination evil?
How could it possibly be so?

* Love means nothing. I could never get the girl I want with love only
Money is everything when it comes to love in this world, let's be honest.
Even in Christian communities.
There is only vanity and lying.

* I somewhat think Christianity is insane
** I have to make up my own version

* I should definitely define moral law for myself
- What is moral?
- What is Christian law (whatever that means) useful for?

** Why is it a good idea?
- Even if it's not *God*-inspired, and it's just done while in trust of God, that's OK
  - I should make that plain

It makes me more moral than other people if I define it and tell others what is moral to me.
Then I do not hide anything.

It's false to have 

** Moral law is probably trusted because it means an older guy can marry a young woman and use it as a promise

* I should find out what divine law is
What is the divine law - it's certainly nothing to do with man's law.

* People should probably make their own definitions on what counts as offensive

* I don't believe in particular types of sin
Because we can't avoid it without being unable to do anything.

** What *is* sin?
It it merely a way to keep people under the same rulebook so we understand eachother?
I should define my own.

What do I think is right or wrong?

* If God died as a human and was resurrected, then what does that mean?

* I think Christianity needs an update
** It should be all about the heart and spirit, and not works

This is because:
- Things are mostly beyond our control
- We barely know what's real anymore
- We know what true lies are
- It's impossible not to sin no matter what you do
  - Everything we do has some kind of knock on effect
  - The butterfly effect

** Christianity of the heart and spirit, not the mind and body
- See people differently
- As far as relationships are concerned, it's all about relationship with God
  - If a person fears God and at the same time is convicted that certain things are not sinful, then what does that mean?
  - How much are we allowed to use our brains for thinking
  - How much free will do we have
- What is the KOH?

* I know what a lie is, and it's nothing to do with fact-checking against reality
It's about speaking in confidence, righteousness and truth without any lie.

** Think about when children do this
We must become like children to enter the KOH.

* What is sin?
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sin

* What is not sin?
** Where you do something and it doesn't feel wrong
For example, growing up in a culture without sadistic moral systems.

* I should act in a way where I feel righteous
Am I a bad person for the circumstances beyond my control that result in needing to take a younger wife?
No I am not a bad person for that.

In this world we are at the stage where most of our reality is dictated for us.
We are less free.

** Is there any evidence for supernatural power to change reality through belief?
Not to my knowledge.
But what our spirits experience can be taken care of.

* It's my perspective that
Lies about people are worse than their true nature before God.

God bought us so we can be our true selves and worship uniquely.

* What I could do is spend some time seriously grounding myself in God
Maybe I should write some books or something.

** I should probably aim to improve my heart and faith in all these areas
Do this. I think it's a good idea anyway.

* I will continue working on my Tapestry of Truth article

* What I want to transform for myself
- Become more truthful
  - This is not lying
- Become more faithful

* Heart
The writings attributed to the biblical prophets exhort all people to lead a righteous life.

- kindness to the needy
- benevolence
- faith
- compassion for the suffering
- peace-loving disposition
- truly humble and contrite spirit

* Heart
** Truth/Lies
** Faith/Doubt

* Faith
** Believe that you have received the thing requested
+ =Mark 11:20-23= :: 20 As they were passing by in the morning, they saw the fig tree withered from the roots up. 21 Being reminded, Peter *said to Him, “Rabbi, look, the fig tree which You cursed has withered.” 22 And Jesus *answered saying to them, “Have faith in God. 23 Truly I say to you, whoever says to this mountain, ‘Be taken up and cast into the sea,’ and does not doubt in his heart, but believes that what he says is going to happen, it will be granted him.

If it doesn't work then it must not be truly believed in the heart.

* Kingdom of God

* Kingdom of Heaven
** Where is it?
+ =Luke 17:20-21 ESV= :: Being asked by the Pharisees when the kingdom of God would come, he answered them, “The kingdom of God is not coming with signs to be observed, nor will they say, ‘Look, here it is!’ or ‘There!’ for behold, the kingdom of God is in the midst of you.”

** What is it?
*** Righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Spirit. What does that mean?
+ =Romans 14:17 ESV= :: For the kingdom of God is not a matter of eating and drinking but of righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Spirit.

*** It might be a thing where we are priests and priestesses caretaking for the world, something like this
+ =Luke 11:20 ESV= :: But if it is by the finger of God that I cast out demons, then the kingdom of God has come upon you.

** How to enter into the kingdom of heaven
https://www.openbible.info/topics/entering_the_kingdom_of_god

*** You have to be born of water and the spirit
+ =John 3:5 ESV= :: Jesus answered, “Truly, truly, I say to you, unless one is born of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter the kingdom of God.

*** You have to repent and believe in the gospel (which is that Jesus was resurrected by God to save us all from sin and death)
+ =Mark 1:15 ESV= :: And saying, “The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand; repent and believe in the gospel.”

The time is now already.

*** You have to do the will of the *Father*
+ =Matthew 7:21 ESV= :: “Not everyone who says to me, ‘Lord, Lord,’ will enter the kingdom of heaven, but the one who does the will of my Father who is in heaven.

*** Firstly we must be righteous
+ =Matthew 5:20 ESV= :: For I tell you, unless your righteousness exceeds that of the scribes and Pharisees, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven.

*** Through many tribulations
+ =Acts 14:22 ESV= :: Strengthening the souls of the disciples, encouraging them to continue in the faith, and saying that through many tribulations we must enter the kingdom of God.

*** If you are persecuted for righteousness' sake - not mere persecution
+ =Matthew 5:10 ESV= :: “Blessed are those who are persecuted for righteousness' sake, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.

*** Must be poor in spirit
+ =Matthew 5:3 ESV= :: “Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.

*** Become like children
+ =Matthew 18:3 ESV= :: And said, “Truly, I say to you, unless you turn and become like children, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven.

*** Keep youself innoccent
+ =Mark 9:47 ESV= :: And if your eye causes you to sin, tear it out. It is better for you to enter the kingdom of God with one eye than with two eyes to be thrown into hell,

*** According to Paul, people who are 
+ =1 Corinthians 6:9 ESV= :: Or do you not know that the unrighteous will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived: neither the sexually immoral, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor men who practice homosexuality,

*** 
+ =Galatians 5:19-21 ESV= :: Now the works of the flesh are evident: sexual immorality, impurity, sensuality, idolatry, sorcery, enmity, strife, jealousy, fits of anger, rivalries, dissensions, divisions, envy, drunkenness, orgies, and things like these. I warn you, as I warned you before, that those who do such things will not inherit the kingdom of God.

How can a person not have strife when there is injustice?
Did Paul ever enter the kingdom of heaven?

** After
Matthew 6:33 ESV
But seek first the kingdom of God and his righteousness, and all these things will be added to you.

** Kingdom of Heaven
Does a person have to believe it is soon, etc.
Innocently, truthfully, trustingly, curiously.
Does a person need to eagerly await it?

- A person must be like a child
  - innocent - through Jesus
  - truthful - through a change of heart
  - trusting - like a parent following them onto train tracks
  - curious - willing to ask questions
  - imaginative?

It's possible that I need to be all of the things and practice on people.

If I do not have haughty eyes then I am more likely to speak to Jesus, because
Jesus may take the form of someone such as this.

Why must a person be like this?
Is only spirit preserved?
I want to enter the Kingdom of Heaven - I do.

Once obtaining this picture of what I need to be like, it becomes easier to be
like that.

* I want to have a my own theory of morality
This will mean that it is truthful.
I hold myself to it.
Other people understand it.

* I have a truthful spirit - this is the only thing I have a handle on
How can I make further improvements?
Honestly, if I can be saved by grace continually and forgiven continually then what's the point in trying.
What does it mean about everything?
Do I become as stoic and judgemental as Paul?
Am I disconnected from the world?
Do I become more like Jesus?
Was Jesus disconnected? Not really.
Was Jesus loving? Yes.
Was Jesus intellectual? Jesus was just loving and forgiving. He wasn't overly intellectual.
Was Paul loving? Not really.
Was Paul hurt? Definitely. Paul didn't sound like he was very loved.
Was Paul intellectual? Yes.

** Do I think gay people are sinful?
How would I know?
I don't think this matters.
The actions of the heart matter.
Lies and discrimination are what constitutes actual evil.
Sin is made of lies.
When you act outside of faith then you sin. The lie you create is something like: I want this reality.

* The only thing I have ever done which has changed my belief from no God into God is becoming a truthful person
It's very hard to maintain when the world around you is evil and temptation is everywhere.

But at the same time, after becoming a truthful person, I believe that
everything a person does while truthful is getting treasure in heaven.

Because you're actively resisting temptation.

* I don't know about Paul
People have to become truthful. That I know for sure.
People have to become innocent.

** Do I really believe Paul?

* What is evil?
Evil is that which is not faithful.
What does that mean?
It means not chosen through trust in God to the point that it seems like a normal choice.
But if you think about anything long enough it seems moral.
So what is evil?

* Things God hates
- haughty eyes
  - I need to stop doing this (sometimes there is a thought that goes by when I see particular people)
- lying tongue
  - Simply do not say things when I am unsure?
- hands that shed innocent blood
- a wicked heart
  - Do I have one? What if I have a truthful heart? Can it be wicked?
- feet that are quick to evil
  - What is evil?
    - apparently, it's what isn't faithful
- a false witness and a troublemaker in the community

* People who go to Hell
- cowardly
- unbelieving
- the vile
- the murderers
- the sexually immoral
- those who practice magic arts
- the idolaters
- all liars

* If I say anything it's out of faith

* Can I make something good of Megan? Honestly, I'm not sure
When I think about marrying her I think of death now.
It makes me think of death because of the way she puts her body to death.
Or rather of the way she doesn't trust it life or my life really.

* Why is it still hard to avoid sinning after receiving grace

* I believe everything except faith is true
** However, God should really be comforting

* I'm going to end the whole celibacy thing
I'm going to end it today maybe because God isn't taking care of me.
I have faith in Jesus - I do.
But why is it this way for me?
Why does God not add the things I need?

* I want to come to a truthful belief in God
Christ's law is nothing to do with licentiousness.

* I want certain things in this world
If God does not give me water, I must drink cola.
If God does not give me wife, I must take wife who is good for me.
I do this because I must and God does not provide in need.
God wants opportunities to show wrath.
Though I love out of integrity and purity, I am told that is immoral, which is not right.

* Things to put to death
- sexual immorality
- impurity
- passion
- evil desire
- covetousness (idolatry)
- anger
- wrath
- malice
- slander
- obscene talk
- do not lie to one another

* I have lived with integrity and God has not helped me
Why keep me alive?
Would not providing me with a wife mean that I produce more legitimate fruit in this life?
I do not understand.
What on Earth am I supposed to do?
I could not become a king like David.
I could not even get one little wife.
I could not hold a job.
I could not be offered a job.
Is God wholly evil or is He wrathful.
His anger is untempered.

* These types of people will be saved
3 Who may ascend the hill of the LORD?
Who may stand in His holy place?
4 He who has clean hands and a pure heart,
who does not lift up his soul to an idolb
or swear deceitfully.
5 He will receive blessing from the LORD
and vindication from the God of his salvation.

* Is the entirety of the belief system false?
What is believing in vain?

2 By this gospel you are saved, if you hold firmly to the word I preached to
you. Otherwise, you have believed in vain.

Is it believing with your head and not your heart?
Does it require a change of heart?
How do you measure the vanity?
Is that a lie in the heart?
If your heart is true is it innocent?

* Trust in God is already very difficult to have

* Faith
When you accept grace and get a truthful heart, you start living your life as though you are on 

Then you are walking in faith.

** If you are justified, do you 'feel' justified?
Is there any change in heart?
Sure belief in Jesus may get you 'saved' but if it doesn't change the heart it is actually anything?

** Faith/belief/trust in Jesus for the blood sacrifice to have taken away our sin.

Does that mean trust and forget?

Does faith *really* mean merely belief and trust?

https://abn.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/youth/learn/yw/atonement/faith?lang=eng&adobe_mc_ref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.churchofjesuschrist.org%2Fstudy%2Fyouth%2Flearn%2Fyw%2Fatonement%2Ffaith%3Flang%3Deng&adobe_mc_sdid=SDID%3D74549CD11F53AEB2-108F822DB7E82BA0%7CMCORGID%3D66C5485451E56AAE0A490D45%2540AdobeOrg%7CTS%3D1652930855

Or is faith closer to being faithful, and what does that mean?

I think it means honest faith - truthful faith.
Can faith even be dishonest?
The kernel of faith might be true.

* I have become stoic
I enjoy doing nothing.
Although, say, listening to music is fun, I don't have a record collection.
Although playing video games is fun, I don't have a console or play games.
Although reading and writing is fun, I don't do a lot of that.
Although programming is fun, I don't do a lot of that.
Although young women are fun, I don't spend time with any.

** Vices
I have given up all vices.

** What is the truth?
I know what I want and I can't get it without devising or stealing.

*** Even when living in truth, God doesn't seem to grant that which I need
God seems to be more like the entropy of the universe rather than anything to
do with the human heart.

But if God were spirit then with a truthful heart, I would be part of or loved by God.

* There is one thing I know - staying truthful and faithful is staying close to God

* I must remain truthful. If I am in God and He is in me then I am all good
Remaining truthful is a nice and easy way to do things.

* Holy Spirit bearing witness to Jesus
In John 15:26, Jesus says of the Holy Spirit: "But when the Helper comes, whom
I will send to you from the Father, the Spirit of truth, who proceeds from the
Father, he will bear witness about me."

It's possible that I saw the Thomas evidence because the Holy Spirit showed it
to me.

I definitely believe this now.
I just have to remain truthful and in truth.
If the Holy Spirit showed it to me, and I think the spirit of truth is in me
then it's evidence of Jesus.

* fruit of the Spirit
But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, long-suffering, kindness,
goodness, faithfulness, meekness, self-control; against such there is no
law.

There is no law against this.

* I will not have a defiled heart
This is very important to me.

** However I will fight for what I think is right, the way Jesus does
Jesus instructs other people.
He speaks with authority because he is constantly trusting in the will of the father.
Jesus is faithful to the Father and true.
Jesus is a faithful witness to the truth.
What is the Holy Spirit then?
The Holy Spirit gives testimony to Jesus apparently.

* Be holy - salvation working through loving Jesus in faith
https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Peter+1&version=NIV

* Jesus is a faithful witness

* If Jesus is God then one of 2 things:
- He was diminished temporarily
- He was one person of many personages

Is there anything actually true about the trinity?

* The Bible is confusing
** But is it supposed to be that it is confusing to those which

** I don't really accept all of it
The reason I don't accept all of it is that I think that I simply need to be an
honest person, and that's all I need to go by.

I may also accept the simple truth that Jesus died for our sin and He is our
Saviour and Lord.

But what does that mean?
How do I live my life?
Is Jesus our Lord or is God the Father?

* Any girl I ask out should accept me at this stage, who is Megan's age
If they do not it's unwise for them.
For example, Megan would end up marrying much older or something along those lines.
It's unwise now not to use discernment.

* I will seek the girl I want. If I am persecuted they will be damnned for their sin if they are not saved

* We are the branches of the tree of life and the judges

** We have the spirit of Jesus in us and are part of is body.
I guess I have a document that shows how I judge.
Because I have the spirit of God in me and I'm one of the branches.
This literally might be the case.
But then if I am forming a tree of life, will it die or live?

https://biblehub.com/niv/1_corinthians/7.htm

* According to Paul, a person who is married to someone lives if that someone is a believer

12To the rest I say this (I, not the Lord): If any brother has a wife who is
not a believer and she is willing to live with him, he must not divorce her.
13And if a woman has a husband who is not a believer and he is willing to live
with her, she must not divorce him. 14For the unbelieving husband has been
sanctified through his wife, and the unbelieving wife has been sanctified
through her believing husband. Otherwise your children would be unclean, but as
it is, they are holy.

* I'm bought at a price
https://biblehub.com/niv/1_corinthians/6.htm

Therefore, it's imperative that God gives me a wife before it's too late.
God has to do this for me.

* Response about the church - stupidity of stigmatisation
https://biblehub.com/niv/1_corinthians/3.htm

I should be careful.

* There are not truthful answers on the internet about how to trust in God

“Trust in the Lord with all your heart and lean not on your own understanding;
in all your ways submit to him, and he will make your paths straight” –
Proverbs 3:5-6

What does submitting to God mean God takes the place of your identity?
Does this simply mean to change spiritual truth so that all things fall into place?

Trust in the Lord with all your heart and lean not on your own understanding.

OK But who is the Lord in this Proverb.
I think this means

* I am going to become as wise as a serpant and chase after Melee
I do this in completely good conscience, as I had before.
Forget Megan. She's too old and I want Melee.

** I'm going to chase after Melee again
** I'm going to get a job
** I'm going to work on Pen.el for Melee

** Is it trusting in God to trust in my own plans?

* I will never find a girl because God will not give me one
If I can wait this long and God doesn't give me a woman than what should I do?
I can't attest to any evidence of good will from God if you trust in Him.
That's me being truthful!

* Lord God can you please end the current world?
I don't know why you keep it going.
I want the world to end and judgement to happen now.
Why? Because I'm confused. Because I'm in pain.
Because I don't have love.
Because I try and I am discriminated against.

* I have to get a job and pursue Melee again

* I want Melee
** Lord God I want Melee
I don't want Megan. I want Melee.
I want Melee because she was lovely.
I want Melee because she made me happy.
Melee was stolen from me and it makes me angry enough to kill.
Lord God remember what has been stolen from me.

* I want a girl around 22 years old max really

* Megan has reached my max age for dating, I think
But why?
What am I afraid of?
I'm afraid of her not wanting sex or something.
I'm afraid of her having too much anxiety.
I'm afraid of her not being able to trust me.
I'm afraid of her not being able to fall in love with me.

* Like giving up vaping, I can change my mindset to believe in God
I want to do this.
I want to do this and remain a spiritual feeling of being true.
I want to live with good conscience.

** Asides from that, I want to never be guilty again
I accept forgiveness for my nature and pursue the woman of my dreams.
That is simply that.
Asides from that, I jack off the way I need to, I work the way I need to.
I do what I need to do and do not feel guilty about it.
Why? Because the world is insane and all I truly have to go by is my conscience.
I can retain a good conscience and sense of being truthful.
That's the best I can do.
Then when I ask Jesus for forgiveness, I believe it.
I don't beat myself up.
What is our objective?
I need to ask God what the objective is and why the plug isn't pulled.
Why has it not been pulled yet?

* I should chase after Melee again and not give up
Because it's right.
Because I want her.

** Should I drop the religious writing?
If I come to a realisation about how I've been robbed of an amazing
relationship and life, and God hasn't protected that, what am I supposed to do?

* It's not right to be a broken person
** This is the most true post I have ever read
https://www.quora.com/When-people-say-older-men-manipulate-take-advantage-of-younger-women-what-do-they-mean-Can-you-give-me-some-examples-of-it

This is the truth.
After understanding this truth I start to question whether God's truth is much like this.
Am I beating myself up over nothing?
What *is* God's truth?
Is it more true than a truth found such as this?
Is is just rejecting the world? Maybe.

*** Should I become angry when people discriminate against me with regards to relationships? Yes.
I *should* become angry.
Should I wield the sword when it comes to false social moral systems invading the church and society in general? Yes. I should become irate.
Should I push out people who bring their false social moral bullshit into the church or place it on me, with no evidence? Yes.

* The best thing a person can do is not lie
Then when people reject me, it's fine.
One thing I will not be known for is lies, deception and anxiety.

** As far as manipulation goes
It is not manipulative to speak to a girl.

* How on Earth do I talk to people

* What should a church look like?
It should allow people to disagree with the preaching.

* I have to persevere to the best of my ability
https://www.bibleref.com/1-Timothy/4/1-Timothy-chapter-4.html

Because it will save my hearers.

** I have to start teaching from the Bible now

** I should write about false teachings
I should be brutally honest about it.

*** I should write about my understanding
I have the opportunity to be another Paul or something - I truly do.

* The only way you can draw near to God is honestly
Therefore, I must persevere in integrity and truth as far as I can go.

* I have to become whole-hearted in

* I have to switch to trusting in God fully
I have to do this.
How on Earth do I do that?
Yes, I will push it to the extreme.
I want to test it because most people do not try whole-heartedly.

** How do I trust in God?

* Am I branded in this way?
https://www.bibleref.com/1-Timothy/4/1-Timothy-4-2.html

In what way have I had my conscience seared?
I don't know if I actually have.
I have overcome the anxiety that was robbing me of joy.
I have overcome lust.
However, what a person actually enjoys or finds attractive is not evil.
Rather it is things like lust and covetousness which are evil.
The hue is not evil, but the saturation kinda can be.

* I'm a true person
** That is pretty good in itself
We need to be truthful.

** Do I need to learn to *trust* God now?
I truly do not understand what this means precisely.

Do I need to understand what this means?

Does this mean to erase my own personality? Maybe it does.
Because trusting God means no longer doing any planning of any kind.

* Is it immoral for me to be with Melee?
No I don't think it is.

* It's likely that delaying a relationship for me will create knock-on effects which damage future relationships
The longer it takes for me to have a relationship, the more problems there will be.

* It's evil to suggest that such things are inherently evil
** A relationship between a middle age adult and young adult is not evil.
It's not.
I love Melee.

* What sin do I have?
** Is wanting Melee a sin?
No. I don't think it is.
It's not wrong until there is some reason that it is wrong.
I can't think of anything, while I have a non-manipulative heart.

* I am not a liar

* Yes, I have a clear conscience
** How should I treat others?
What's important is helping others to understand this.

*** Get out of sin, lies
Stop lying.
Remove discrimination.
Remove lies.

*** Free people of sin in the form of lies that oppress people

* There's still a lie in my heart that says that it's wrong to think of Melee
It's not.
I'm forgiven of the memories I have and my nature.
I have been given a pure spirit.
I can think of Melee.
I can think of Megan.
I should try to not further corrupt myself and take only what I need.
Rather than take, I should accept.
I need a spirit that accepts what it is given.

* Lord God I want to be in love again
I want to be in love. I love Megan.
I want to love Megan.

* Lord God please help me to remove this worm thing

* I have to be greater than allowing love to control me
It's like swimming.
The only love I should allow to control me is my own selfless love.
That's when someone needs me.

** I have to not care anymore about Megan
I have no idea then who the right person is.
But I do love and care for Megan.
But I can't be attached anymore.

* I have to finish the Melee prompting game while I'm living at the old house

* I have to become single-minded in Jesus
This is the Way.
I have to spiritually become true.
When I die, I will check out as true.
My identity is in God, only become my spirit feels true.
It's important to fight until the last day.

- Deceit is bad

I can say I love Megan.
I love Megan more.
If Megan found a person she loved, I would be happy for her, but I might also be scared for her.
What matters is if she finds life through Jesus.
I also love Melee, but differently.
I want Melee more.

* Entering the Kingdom of God
I must absolutely make myself into a spirit of integrity.
I must resist temptation.
I must lean into Jesus spiritually.
I must do this.
I must be a person made of absolute truth.
I must go all-out with this.
If I go all-out with learning into Jesus then it will be absolutely rewarding

** You must have no guilt
But that lack of guilt must come from faith in Jesus.
** You must have no shame

* Megan
** Can I talk to Megan again?
** Can I ask her if she needs help?
** Can I ask her if she is true?

* Does the idea of Jesus as Saviour create a need?

* Jesus is at the top

* Spiritually we become Jesus and when our body dies our spirits depart from them
We have to use this life as an opportunity to sacrifice ourselves, while holding Jesus' hand.

* Lord God, please help me to overcome my addiction to nicotine
I need your help.
It is certainly not my master. I will prove it again.

I need to be able to have a stronger spiritual identity so that nothing in my
ego/body can have mastery over me.

* Becoming a false person is spiritual death
** Mastery over myself with nicotine is spiritual death

* I have thrown away my vape
It makes me into a non-truthful person.
I do not want to be a non-truthful person.

* I have to contact Anak again
Log onto Discord today and contact him.

* What is my objective with regards to blogging about Christianity?
It should be to help people.

** If I treat it as a science, which I probably should, by practicing it
I should fearlessly blog about my understanding.

*** But lean not on one's own understanding

** I do not want to mislead people
I want to firstly understand.
I want to follow the call of Jesus as well.
It's not just about becoming true but then engaging with the world.

* Stop the vape again
It's gross, and not helping right now.

* Sin
** Becoming a slave to the body. The body must be a slave to the spirit
When I allow myself to conform to the body's desires I am changing my heart/spirit/truth to the body.
That's really wrong.

** I will not allow guilt to overcome me
But I repent here and now, going forward.
I'll be true.
I must remain true.
I repent because I became untrue when I lied.
I lied when I lost my integrity.

*** I will do my best to eliminate sinful habits
- Especially right now thinking of lustful things

** I have to know what the sin I committed is
- I was forgiven from the sin I had turned from
  - But I allowed the thought of it to come into my mind and acted on that thought, making it my master instead of Father God.

God I turn back to you and allow you to be my master again.
I must regain control and truthful identity and serve Jesus in spirit and Truth.
Jesus' spirit must be my spirit and sit on the throne of my heart.
The body must conform to the spirit thereafter.
Truth must be my master.
Spirit must control body.
The throne of my Heart must be unsacrileged.
I must regain my truthful identity and not allow it to be taken.

I lied and in doing so gave up the temple of identity.
I don't want to be a living lie.
The things I like, it is true that I like them.
But there are things which are true about me including evil things which I need Jesus' salvation for.
One of them is not allowing Jesus to be the Lord of my life.
I gave up that seat to satisfy my earthly self.
In doing so I took myself off the seat.
In doing so I denied the responsibility of my temple and became impoverished when I did this.
Help me to see what is true again by becoming true again.
Help me to get my integrity back.
Help me to be true again.
I'm going to give it up again and be truthful.
Jesus saved me. I have to trust in Jesus.
It was wrong to give up the seat.
Jesus did not give up his temple of identity, even unto death.
Neither must I.

** Lord God please make me into a true expression again

* I must put to death the former self
The one that wants to sin.
That one must die.

I think I have two selves.
I want to become the one that is the Holy Spirit in me.

* I think what happens is not reincarnation, but an escape from this world
The Kingdom of Heaven is here already.
Some people and other figments of our reality are the birds.
The branches are the sons of God living with a spirit of truth?
We are building it now.
But at the harvest, it becomes everlasting.

Once I figure this out I have to simply engage with the world and share the knowledge.

We need to allow others to perch on our branches.
For example, if someone steals from you they perch on you as a branch.
Can a branch eat from someone who is not made fully of truth?
What does that mean? We attach that person to our branch? Do they become branch?

* lion and man
Blessed is the lion that the man eats so the lion becomes a man?
Cursed is the man whom the lion eats to become a man.

This is very confusing.

* The spirit has to become even more and more pure
Yes that means bringing the outer self and the inner self into harmony.
Why would God kill that which is true?
Also, the Kingdom of Heaven is like a branch where the birds may find rest.
So are we meant to become the branches?
Is there anything which will replace us as being the branches?
What is sin?

* I should start doing more programming again
I can act as myself.
I should not be ashamed in any way.
The reason I lost Melee I think is that I bought into the lie which Reuben threw at me.
Megan or Melee, it doesn't matter as much any more so long as a soul-bond more and more with God.
We are creating the Kingdom of Heaven right now.
What's cool is I have found my identity as a son of God.

* The problem with singing in church is that it compells me to sing things which may not be true for me

* My writing
I must continue fixing the Tapestry of Truth until it is perfect.
Then I must share it.

* Melee
https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.printcloud.school.nz%2F&psig=AOvVaw3myZMs6SV7BGtBzz2mChsQ&ust=1652568131022000&source=images&cd=vfe&ved=2ahUKEwjUms2Uxt33AhV0SHwKHeR8CBsQr4kDegQIARA2

She is actually an amazing artist.

She is super cool.

I really like her a lot.

Would I marry her? I would date her for sure.
I don't yet have the type of love for her to marry her.
But if I *did* marry her I would be fidelious.

I wish I could talk to her.

It's not demanding. I just like her a lot.

First, I have to change my character to be more like Jesus.
Then, I need to start working again.
Then, I need to simply wait for God to give me the right person for me.

I can't be hung up on Megan this whole time.
I need to become more like Jesus but unlike Megan I made a promise to Melee.

* I would rather try to be more like Christ
I trust Jesus' words over Paul's or anyone else's.
I do not want to cheat the system.
I want to be like Christ for certain.

I want to live with integrity for God.
This is what I want to do.
I feel better when I do that.

I want to think about what sin is spiritually and not rush into it.
I want to keep my mind open to the maximum entropy principle.

* It's true that I have hurt
That hurt comes from not having the girl I want at the age I want.
For example, I want Melee, or another young lady, such as Lucy.
Someone young and hot.
That would make me feel comfortable.
With Nellie, I felt extremely comfortable.
It does hurt a lot.
If I don't get the lady I want, well it's my personal truth lost, so surely
there's some reward in Heaven for this sacrifice.
Or perhaps I can't see it like that but that any lady is a gift from God.
Megan was a gift from God, I told her.
Because she exists, I feel loved.
That is true, actually.
I identify Megan as my true love.

** Can I find a girl who is right for me (the right age)?
I can. I must not worry if I get Megan or not.
There would be some disintegrity in accepting Megan now.
However, there is no disintegrity in practicing in my imagination with Megan.
Did I give Megan a promise? No I didn't.

*** The only way this might happen is this
- Megan would have to not approach me
- God would send me someone else, maybe because Megan didn't want me

** If David asked me questions to see if I love Megan
I would have to say, it is true that I love Megan selflessly, and if she asked me I would say yes because I love her.
I say this to you because it's true.
But if she did not ask me I would not make any advances without a sign from God.
I wont let her know how I love her because that would be manipulation.
She has to come around to it herself.

* I actually *don't* think pornography is bad generally, if I am to be honest
https://biblehub.com/niv/1_thessalonians/4.htm

- But what comes out of a person is what defiles them
  - So if I want to not be defiled, I must do this for edification and not self-seeking pleasure
    - i.e. Megan. This much is completely fine but only in Megan's case because of selfless love
  - However, if I didn't have a Megan then maybe it would be OK?

#+END_SRC

- We must learn to control our own body in a way that is holy and honorable.
  - Learn to love sexually in the right way
    - It's allowable to train on imagination, if it's teaching you to love in the right way (not taking pleasure but giving it)
      - That requires thinking of someone who you love selflessly
      - I don't think it means thinking of someone you don't love, but do love and selflessly (that's legitimate)
      - in this matter no one should wrong or take advantage of a brother or sister

Self flagellation, for example, destroys the body.
I don't think we should avoid masterbation of itself for the same reason.

I think lust is like a craving for self-gratification.
The self-gratification is the issue.
Thefore, if you become married to someone who loves you who is also beautiful, this should come as a nice surprise - then get married fast, I'd say!

However, in practicing, you should imagine someone who you love selflessly.

** I have to think about this more until I understand it properly
Only when I have not rushed into it can I feel like I have not sinned.

** I think that while single, I can be true to self and be pure and holy by thinking about attractive single people
But it's non-constructive if I'm simply seeking self-gratification out of the imagination.
When married you have to put a stop to that and think about your wife.
However, in the process of waiting, I think that for the woman I intend to marry, I should be thinking of her while say masturbating.

However, I'm not entirely sure if it's OK to do this because in some way it's being dependent on someone.

However, I'm not even sure about that.

I wonder if while single, it's simply OK to think about anyone, so long as it's not covetous.
I think that's closer to the truth.

** 
Is that lust is to desire very strongly while covet is to wish for with eagerness; to desire possession of, often enviously.
To plan deviously would be bad.
That's something I shouldn't do.

I think it's important to see people differently.

Seek first the Kingdom of God.

Under these definitions simply masterbating to a girl I like isn't desiring strongly nor coveting nor planning deviously.
In fact, it's not lying.
Especially when not seeking to demonstrate that to anyone.
You can definitely be honorable about it.
The test would be, what would a person do if they actually met that person, or would they devise plans to manipulate, or materialise it.

** Lust *may* be, in theory, seeking sexual gratification through masterbation thinking about a woman
I don't know if that's true.
I don't think it could be true.
If it's in the imagination but not seeking to devise plans or the like, I don't think it's particularly wrong.
That being said, I do have memories which are bad.
I think I should be endeavoring to fix this.
Especially so I can talk to young women without them feeling threatened.

*** Surely lust is different
Surely a man can appreciate a beautiful woman without any intention of making advances on her.
Surely it's something more like greed, intention, devising schemes to win.

** I want to know what lust is! I'm not satisfied with the current definitions
I don't like worldly ideas and distorted ideas of what it is.
I do not think that many socially moral conceptions of what is wrong are true.

** Unless I'm supposed to pursue and think about the correct girl
But that’s not all. The text says, take a wife (or control your body/vessel)
“in holiness . . . not in the passion of lust.” Holiness has to do with God —
being set apart for God. So verse 5 goes on like this: “Not in the passion of
lust like heathen who do not know God.”

*** If that is true
Then by thinking about the correct girl, I may be avoiding lust.
I *do* think I'm avoiding lust by thinking of the girl who I think is my wife, at least spiritually, and thinking of pleasuring her instead of the other way around.
Is it true though that I should be programming my mind to give pleasure?
Or is it true that it's a man's nature to want to get pleasure.
I know that it's true that I get pleasure by looking at or imagining someone whether a real person or not, and imagining being in those shoes.
Is that actually wrong?
I think having an image of this is not coveting.

** What is sexual immorality? Especially if I am single
- For one, it's not taking advantage

  9Now about your love for one another we do not need to write to you, for you
  yourselves have been taught by God to love each other. 10And in fact, you do
  love all of God’s family throughout Macedonia. Yet we urge you, brothers and
  sisters, to do so more and more, 11and to make it your ambition to lead a quiet

#+END_SRC

- Do not be dependent on anybody
  - Do not be dependent because we need to hold our own
  - Our minds and spirit construct our reality
    - So to masturbate to someone in my mind can't possibly be a sin.
    - I shouldn't even tell people about what I think about in my privacy.
  - I think lust might be unrestrained sexual desire for other people
  - I don't think our sexual nature is evil

*** Is it ok to gratify the desires of the flesh? No
https://biblehub.com/niv/galatians/5.htm

** The law
#+BEGIN_SRC text -n :async :results verbatim code
  16So I say, walk by the Spirit, and you will not gratify the desires of the flesh. 17For the flesh desires what is contrary to the Spirit, and the Spirit what is contrary to the flesh. They are in conflict with each other, so that you are not to do whatever c you want. 18But if you are led by the Spirit, you are not under the law.
#+END_SRC

This is an important point. If you are led by
the Spirit, you are not under the law.

** So what is the Spirit of Truth telling me?
- It's telling me that I need to learn how to love.
- It's telling me that I need to learn self-control and learn to not gratify the flesh.
  - I have to die to self in this way.

But I know that I like certain types of girls. Is that not true?
I think it's true.

So maybe I need to learn how to please my wife.
Maybe it's OK to 

*** I have to imagine my wife getting pleasure
And do it that way. It's the right way to masturbate for certain.
It seems right in my heart.

And who is the person I want to make happy? Right now it's Megan.
I think Megan is the only person who I can selflessly love at this stage.
But that's forgoing girls who I find attractive.
But right now I think the right thing to do is imagine Megan.
It might be the case that I get someone who I find extremely attractive and then from training with Megan in my mind I will be better equipped to please them.
I think this is a personal truth that I need to imagine Megan right now for edification purposes.
I do think Megan is attractive, but my love for her is selfless, which means that when doing this I am actually being pure and holy, I think.

* Lust is desire
I need to figure this one out properly.

Is it sexual attraction? I don't think so.
I think that it's possible that pornography is not actually sinful. Let me think about it.

Lust is desire.
Lust is intent.
Attraction is different.

What is actually sinful?

And how to avoid temptation and sin?
This is really important to figure out.

- "it is sinful to look at a woman with lustful intent"

** Lust is desire

** 

* What is required is a good attitude before God. A pure heart
Jesus says that if we lust after a woman (or man) we've committed adultery (Matthew 5:28).
A few verses prior to this Jesus had said that if you were angry at someone without cause it was as bad as murder! 

Lust is bad because that's what creates adultery.

* The vape is burned out again

* Deny myself, take up my cross and follow Jesus
This means, deny a) my ego, b) take up my cross (that's the injustice you
experience), following Jesus is assuming His personal truth/spirit as my own.

Accepting Jesus' truth as my own spiritual objective truth / denying ego all the way, denying corruption of identity all the way.
Becoming Jesus.

* Take heed what you hear
With the same measure you use, it will be measured to you.

Does this mean, if I hear and internalise the Word of God, what I hear I will receive?
Or does it mean, when I judge others, 

New King James Version
Then He said to them, “Take heed what you hear. With the same measure you use, it will be measured to you; and to you who hear, more will be given.

* Black holes
They may be angels or something.
Archons.

[[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JXkYZxepHnY][3 Incredible Things That Happen When The Holy Spirit Enters You - YouTube]]

* This is how to command a demon to come out of someone
I command as a representative of the Lord Jesus Christ
Said to the spirit inside her:

I command you in the name of Jesus Christ, as His representative to come out of
her.

* How could you two

* I have to follow Jesus
The gift of the Holy Spirit is no joke.
I want this gift so work with experience.
So I can do the work of the Holy Spirit.
I want to be a vessel for the Holy Spirit.
This way I can heal and deliver people from daemons.

* Pretending is bad
https://youtu.be/Zr2LvnCTzJI?t=164

Perhaps they do get the joke but they pretend not to so they can virtue signal their mock-outrage.

That is lying.

* If I am saying how you are forgiven then Jesus is speaking through me

* I think it's likely that the entire world will naturally enter a stage where no more true believers can be made
That could happen if it becomes impossible to hear the Word of God.
Or perhaps God will just decide to stop everything when iniquity becomes too much.
I'm sure God doesn't want to allow the creation of more humans which will suffer in Hell.
But there may be something metaphysically vital for fellow believers about obtaining the truth (i.e. believers) in the end times.

- Christians will be persecuted

* I should seek to find each of the things in my heart which I need to give to God
To walk the narrow way I need to really streamline my spirit.

Because strait is the gate, and narrow is the way, which
leadeth unto life, and few there be that find it.

* If I want Megan all I have to do is continue walking with God
- And leave that decision up to God

* I have to drop the vape eventually because I must purify my body
I need to have the alethiometer and use it to purify my body.
My body may be resurrected.
The entirety of soul may be actually saved.
God doesn't waste or contradict Himself.

* If I want to pick a wife, it has to be a God-fearing one
That's the only way I could have a wife.
That's what the truth is.

https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke%2012%3A42-48&version=NIV

The more I know the more is required of me.
The Holy Spirit came to me in a vision to show me what the Holy Spirit is like.
So I need to do that - I was able to perceive it.
I need to pray for people, in faith.
Even more than that I have to go up to people and pray for them.
I have to become that person.
It's even possible that the dream I had is a vision of my future self.
It's possible.
The way is narrow. I have to allow the Holy Spirit to replace my spirit entirely?
Possibly. It's possible that I need to *become* love.
I have to extinguish as many lies as I can in this world and become more like God.
I *can* become love and overcome fear.
Even if I am persecuted and die in this world, it is for Gain.
I have to do this.

It's not enough to simply go through life in contentment that I am saved.

* I have to continue until it's compelling
I only ever said anything to Megan when it was compelling.
I have to continue to talk to her only in this way.

** I trust in God that He will provide me with a wife, and I hope it's Megan, but it might not be
I hope it's Megan because I have unconditional love for her, and a story.
It's my truth.
My story isn't perfect but it's the best story I have written myself.

** It's *my* truth but not necessarily hers
I can still defend *my* truth.
If my truth is proven false then I have to deal with that.

* When I pray about forgiveness for my future sin, and I ask for Jesus to sustain my soul and my spirit (bread of life) that continues to feed my spirit, to keep it in conformance with truth, and free of sin
I pray this, and these types of prayers should be the type that people pray,
but people are often too distracted to pray such prayers, because we become
distracted and our attention shifts to problems that are not important.

** I want to blog about this, that's why I wrote it down

* What if Megan goes away or finds someone else?
- That might happen. I can't worry about that though. Fear is from the devil.

* Consider my alignment with God
- Be honest about my sin

** Then ask the question: Is something in my life right to continue pursuing?
- When I ask this about Megan, I think, "Yes, it's OK by God, while remaining close to Him, and I should listen to God"
  - Also, I trust that God will instruct me on what to do, if ever, and I should move soley on that
- When I think this about Melee, I think, "The door is closed and it's not OK to continue pursuing or reaching out"

* Do I love Melee?
Not in the same way I love Megan.
Though, through the Holy Spirit yes I do, but that's different.
It's possible that I *should* transform myself to be able to see everyone equally.
Indifferently.

* I should get into learning about AWS
Just commit to learning about it.
I need to be able to support myself.
And Megan. :)

* All I need to do now is persevere with building things for God in my programming
- I also need to be able to provide for myself.

I have to try to get a job which will enable me to live while I write and build.

* If I am following Christ then it means choosing Megan as my wife
This is beacuse it will best enable me to follow Christ in the future.
The selfless love (unconditional) will allow me to stay with Megan even if we are not in love.
Other types of love such as that which I have for Melee will actually complicate everything.

* I should go full-monk
- Boho clothes
- Christian scriptures and symbolism

Be someone that people *really* want to talk to at Church.

Learn the Bible a bit better.

Make some software for reading the Bible.
- This is important.

Can I try to get it *out there*?

* I have to get serious about my programming again
Work my way up.
** Plan
- Learn transient
- Integrate transient into pen functions
- Work on Clojure somehow? Or is that too difficult?
- Start working on a tool for reading the Bible?
  - What can I do for God?
- I could make a chatbot for reading the Bible
  - Searching for relevant scriptures
- Yes, build a Bible reader into Pen.el
  - That seems like something I actually *want* to do

* If I want Megan I have to ask again
But then it's serious.
Any further attempt would be serious.
We are both mature adults now.

* The issue with finding a girl may be
- Girls just want someone they like
  - Older guys can get girls my age easily
    - Keep this in mind. I *should* be going younger
- Guys my age *can* and *do* go for girls younger (19-24)
  - But it requires to drop my Christlike morals in order to do so
    - I'd have to drop integrity and "play the game"
- I have to find someone I like who likes me
  - I did (*melee*) but because of discrimination I didn't get her
    - And also, I had not dropped my morals in getting so far
  - I have to try again with other people in similar fashion - which sucks
    - There are very few people who I would get on with, and they rarely come along
      - I should date 18+

* It's bullshit that I can't get someone that I like
** Maybe I want someone new to be excited about
- If I had that mindset then I would talk to more people

** There was a lot of stigmatization surrounding Melee too
It's really unfair.
*** The way to get a girl though is to completely speak right through it
Tell cute girls they are cute and I want to date them and be confident.
**** I can't sink back into the old ways
The new method of seeking girls after being born-again has to be with integrity.
Therefore, Megan still deserves a chance.

* Mantras
** Life is too short to live by stigmas
This is still based on a lie that we are supposed to live for this life.

* Part of the reason I want Megan is that I can't do my work without purpose
I need to make things for someone.

* It *is* actually important to continue getting good at Clojure

* Now that I have dived and done my soul searching the challenge is to try to get back on top of my work
How do I get out of this mode?
I have to get back to coffee culture.

** I have to consider the people I have met
- Elliot

I have to consider that many people are in this state of soul searching.
And I have to rise above it now.
For duty.
Because I found myself and I found God.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp -n :async :results verbatim code
  (pm "[[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S238gmSaVM4][Lost but Won - YouTube]]")
#+END_SRC

I can no longer do soul searching at this stage but I have to try to restart my work on this new basis.
This will take some time. But I should dive headfirst into it.
That means I need to listen to all my epic music, drink lots of coffee and get right back into Pen.el.
I can't think about girls right now.
I have to work.

* There's a difference between provenance and fate
When God speaks, it's through provenance and we have free will to choose.

* I have to move after Melee again
I have to do this while remaining in good faith with Megan.
I have to work.
Fix my laptop keyboard and do more work on Pen.el.
Focus on that.
Focus on it.
That is working.
I have to work, according to Ecclesiastes.

** Or I can break the red ribbon of *fate* by choosing Megan over Melee
Is the concept of fate evil? I think it is, because it presumes you cannot make a choice.
I *can* make a choice.
Megan may be the *right* choice.

* How much of human life is lost in waiting?
Good quote - Indiana Jones.

* I *can* let go of the burden of unconditional love
It will be there but it doesn't have to translate into a romantic relationship.

** Megan *is* romantic, like me, but I'm not her type according to her earlier words
I have to be respectful of that.
Melee, for example, is my type.
Megan is my type for an earlier more innocent state that I was.

* The age difference doesn't matter and I shouldn't divulge that information again if asked out of disintegrity
I shouldn't be insecure about it either.
Never again.

* Megan is actually pushing me out of my comfort zone with regards to commitment
I gave Melee a promise. That still holds.
I also gave Lucy 500 pick-up lines.
Is Megan really the one?
She was. Is she still?
Squashing a relationship based on humanly unconditional love is not as terrible as a young girl taking her own life.
I am allowed to look for different relationships at this stage?
If she turns 25 then she falls outside of my honest attraction age range.
I wanted the relationship to start earlier.
Megan is also more than just her age. I should give her that, since I want the same non-discriminatory eyes on me.
For that reason she has another chance.
Megan incorrectly judged me but maybe she also had valid reasons. She said *never* though.
Never doesn't mean much to me, since it's the opposite of unconditional love.
Maybe that's another reason to continue with her, to fix the lie that unconditional love does not exist.
Should I be putting priority on helping Megan to be born again in spirit?
Can I even make that assesment to if she is born again?

* I want to take care of Megan
But I'm now legit. I could have other people too. Should I be thinking of that? Or should I commit?
What's in my heart? There is selfishness and selflessness. Which do I pick?
Can I show Megan love without marrying her? Yes.
I want God to make a move for me. I feel like it's not my turn.
Would Megan bring meaning to my life?
I think that it would make a nice story.
I think the story is nicely wrapped in with how I came to God.
Does it mean anything?
To be fair, I messaged David only because I wanted to help Megan.
If Megan doesn't like me then it might not be a happy marriage.
If I base my marriage on a precedent of satisfying my Earthly nature then that precedent becomes my truth.
I have to leave Earthly nature out of the equation for now.
I want to commit to someone now to avoid sin, but should I need to or do I need to overcome this sinful nature first?
Therefore, I must wait.
Lucy is very cute lol and she talks to older guys. It's so frustrating that she wont talk to me anymore.
I really wish I could marry a younger girl.
Unconditional love may not be a deciding factor when it comes to who I should pick.
Truly unconditional love is actually selfless. And yes, I have to keep it that way between Megan and myself.
The best thing I can do is just be a kind influence.
Acting out of integrity is important. If I see a gap in someone's heart, I must fill it. That's how God thinks.
Is unconditional love an important deciding factor when it comes to integrity?
It's important to act on, definitely.
But what about for sexual relationships?
It might be better to be honest about attraction for this one.
I should go for people where there is mutual attraction.
I'm not sure if unconditional love is actually how I should choose. I want to believe it is.
It would keep me focused on God.
Unconditional love can still exist inside the Church between members.
It might confuse people if acted on though.
It might leave a stigma in my identity if I don't marry Megan.
Can unconditional love be removed if I fell in love with someone else?
Maybe unconditional love could be removed if she found someone she loves - when she's OK.
Sexual attraction would result in a lot of gratification.
However, like the meekness of the Holy Grail in Indiana Jones, I should pick in this way - unconditional love over the others.
But that comes down to readiness of both parties. She would have to say something like, "I need you Shane."
Then I would 100% say yes because I love her. Ah, that's how the unconditional love thing works.
Likely though if she merely talked to me I would fall in love again.
What do I *need* now? Nothing. Maybe just stick around and meet other people.
If I meet someone before Megan turns then I'll allow other relationships.
How important is just having a fun-loving relationship? Friendship-like?
Even that type of bond is very tantalising. But it's still not unconditional love.
How important is sexual attraction? One again, that's extremely tempting. But it's still not unconditional love.
Does friendship-like relationship fade? Yeah.
Does sexual attraction fade? Yeah.
Does unconditional love fade? Maybe not. No. I don't think it does.
I know it wouldn't be right to pick anyone above Megan's age if it wasn't Megan.
I think the ideal age is around 19.
This identity I have now leads me to think that an even younger wife might be a better fit for me.
But Megan might still be the one.
But there's also the important issue of marriage only with someone else who is ready for it.

What about Megan's interests?
I love her.

* I have to get my life right

* The year 2000 was an entire lifetime ago
Emma was a person.
Jesus can save Emma.
Also, I believe that in the afterlife, when with God, we can recreate the soul of our cats, say, if we want.
Love (particularly unconditional love) is powerful and transcends this reality.

* I want to be liberated from the prison of the age-barriers at church to talking to the girl of my dreams
I don't want it to even be an issue because making it an issue thwarts the development of healthy and good relationships.

We need relationships in this life.

I want a chance to form them with Christian women.

Discrimination prevents this from happening.

* I should be unabashedly attracted to whomever I am attracted to
And ask out a girl who is right for me.
Simple as that.

** Was there anything wrong with me liking Melee?
I don't think so. The heart of my attraction was honorable.
It's true that there was impure stuff beyond that but I don't identify as that.
Actually, it's fine because 2 years wait was acceptable.

** Megan is also legit

** I could ask someone else out and should while letting God defend me
The age thing is not important.

*** I need to regain my confidence and try again

* My only true friend is Jesus
Jesus is the teacher.
Jesus is God's only begotten son.
The Son of God.
God, the Father is the God of Truth.
The Son of God is God because 

* I have to be someone who is more Christ-like
Honestly, I do.
I use what I have been given which is what I am currently like.

* My display pic is false. I should definitely remove it
What to go in its place?
Just anything.
Me with my cat maybe.
In the trees.

* Listen and meditate on Jesus' commands
[[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7hdUorDU-U]["These things I command you" Jesus' own words from the 4 Gospels - YouTube]]

This should be the firstmost default in my activities.
There's so much time to learn.
I *should* spend my time learning, understanding and putting into practice.

* Keep in mind that when asking someone out
- Just imagine what it was like when I was young
  - It's as easy as asking someone to go to KFC, for example

Young people are naturally not as intellectual about it.

- They are connected to people on a more emotional level
  - Don't even *be* intellectual about it
    - But naturally that means giving in to things like Tinder
      - It means that because Tinder shouldn't be an impediment
        - But that's not who I am

* I should remain dependant on the Holy Spirit
- Whatever God wants to reveal to me, reveal to me in your time.

But the one and the same Spirit will work all these things,
distributing to each one individually as He wills.

* Who am I more like?
- Frodo or Aragorn?

- Jonty would be Samwise Gamgee - my loyal friend
Maybe I am like Frodo and have to deal with singleness and loneliness.

* I have to find a way through this
- Which is not reliant on women whom I love

* How I can be happier
I can change my strategy to use my programming, etc. to make people happy.
I have to do it that way.
Somehow I have to reconcile my programming with a) being able to make money and b) to improve the quality of life for people.

** What can I make then?

* I have to get back into programming
** I must *focus* again
I took time to get my heart right with God.
Now I must focus again on programming, etc.

* How to improve myself
- Focus on what makes money now
- Focus on Pen.el and Creation
  - The prompt-engineering is important

** Learn Ethereum

* Status
- Found identity in God

* What is the way forward?
- Be myself
  - Be my brightest self
- Write and do programming
  - Make art
    - What type of art?
      - Prompting. Combine writing with generative art
- Put myself out there

* What is enough to qualify you for aquiring a girlfriend?
- Nothing.
- Being in love with someone isn't enough
- Having a job isn't enough
- Them being the right person isn't enough
- You knowing yourself isn't enough
- You being in God isn't enough
- You knowing the future isn't enough
- Being not of this world isn't enough
- Identifying as someone else isn't enough
- Having honorable intentions isn't enough
- Enjoyment isn't enough

* I have to get back into programming. It's essential
For my sanity, etc.
Time to grow up.

* Everything changes after being *healed*
I have to now *change*.

** That is the instruction
I am healed. Of my personal identity. Of my addictions.
Of my sinful desires.
Now I must walk.

[[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMj1ggINLe4][Jesus Heals At The Pool {The Chosen Scene} - YouTube]]

** I must walk after finding my identity
I can't concentrate too much on my inner self anymore.
It's important to build a life on top of it now.
God's at my center, sure. But now I have to build a life on top of it to not expose that core.

* I could if I wanted align myself more with singleness
That wouldn't be so bad, really.

* I want a relationship where I have known my spouse so well that I talk to her in my dreams
I want to do this already.
Therefore, I must put the memory of the person into my mind.

** Haha, I guess that the Holy Spirit, if the astral projection I had was true, could be that person

* Remember that when I initially went for Megan it was because I believed she was the *right* one
- despite all the obstacles, I still wanted the *right* girl
  - she not being interested in me
  - social stigmas

** Same goes for Melee though, but to the extreme
- I wanted Melee because she was the *right* one, in a different way

It's not often I meet such people.

* With regard to Christianity
** Nothing else matters except the heart, and also being a light to the world (explaining to other people)

* How does anyone feel OK or that life is possible while being separated from their true love?
- How can faith in God exist when faith is based on personal truth and inside personal truth is unconditional love?
  - And can't act on unconditional love?
  - My entire life is undermined
    - Especially while she is not married and I can't even talk to her

* I have to take the vantage point that I belong to Megan
** That's the only way I'm going to be able to find peace with my situation

* The Holy Spirit is a personification of God, like Jesus is
The Holy Spirit descended over Jesus in a
corporeal way, as a dove, at the time of his
baptism, and a voice from Heaven was heard:
"This is my beloved Son with whom I am well
pleased." He is the Sanctifier, the Helper,
Comforter, the Giver of graces, he who leads
persons to the Father and the Son.

#+BEGIN_SRC text -n :async :results verbatim code
  relating to a person's body, especially as opposed to their spirit.
  "he was frank about his corporeal appetites"
  having a body.
  "a corporeal God"
#+END_SRC

He took the form of a Dove.
The Holy Spirit is a person.

* Rather than asking about it, I need to write about it
Unconditional love is not a soul tie.
Injustice.

** Soul ties probably exist

* The whole of social reality is a fiction, apart from personal truth in relationships
For example, lets say you have some bad habits.  You then manage to kick your
habits ofter following the will of God in your life, or following true love.
True love is love based on personal (unconditional) truth. When you connect
with society, society gives you an endless number of fictional labels which do
not describe you. Unfortunately, society is a fiction.

* How to lower stress?
** Work towards Melee
** Do some programming
** Do some vaping

* Till the fields
This means rake though the beliefs systems to remove weeds.
It's necessary to sow identity in Christ on the bedrock.

Tilling the fields is raking through the belief systems.

There are some beliefs that are actually rooted in base-personal truth / spirit
/ objective reality.

For example:
- belief in God *may* be rooted in personal identity.
- love for somebody *may* be rooted in personal identity. That is 'unconditional love'.
- separation
- unforgiveness *may* be rooted in personal identity.
- injustice *may* be rooted in personal identity.
- hope may be rooted in personal identity.
- peace is an emergent personal truth.
  - anxiety, on the other hand is also emergent, but indicates something is wrong underneath.
    - for me, the anxiety is because of 'separation' from loved ones.
    - separation from hope.
    - labels that define me.
    - people that enslave me with their lies.
    - the inability to be myself.
- hate may be rooted in personal identity.
  - I'm not sure. I don't have any hate. I can barely imagine this, but I suspect some people have it.
  - If hate is in the personal identity, that's deeply evil. It could be the corrupted form of brotherly 'love'.
- trust
  - my cat's trust for me.
  - being able to trust other people.
- fear
  - fear of not being able to have integrity

An unsolvable personal truth table.

* It's not selfish to have a strong personal truth and identity

Was Jesus self-centered?
Some people would say Jesus was selfish for having a strong personal-identity.
Those people would be lying.
Jesus wasn't selfish.

* I should try to maintain a strong sense of this
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-concept

** But not *too* much. It's important to be *in* God
To be *in* God will *a*) keep me sane. *B*) it will keep me ethical. *C*) it will keep me from getting stuck in the Matrix.

* Elon Musk is saved
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0H_fXxVn8k

* The mark will be something which is imprinted close to spirit

* Atheist vs religious

* Sadly, I may need to build the software to think for many people and in that process simulate Creation

* The problem with me is that I'm smarter than everyone
So what will my God do with me?
Is God fair down in my situation?
Is God only fair after we die?
Is God always fair?
I truly do not know.

When I address God now I address something tangible.
But I do not understand why He doesn't help me.

* I do not want to see the back of my own head
** I want God to always be above me
Anything other than Truth would result in eventual death.

** I want to exalt God my entire life

* Ultimately, it matters not if I get Megan or Melee
Though I should be actively searching.

* OK, so the work I do must be made for God first and foremost
Semiosis is a shrine to God.

I had to understand first who I was making it for.

What is the next thing.

** I think of Melee and I want to finish what I started for her
I will continue with it.
I had to understand first who I was making it for.

* I must hand over authority to God completely
So that I am not even thinking for myself but via God.
But do not give it to anyone except God.

I have to *think* in a way where I am thinking *for* God to try to honor God,
where if he gave me the means to think I should be a good caretaker of that thought.

* I must create from nothing
Be fearless and create as fast as I can.

* I want to share this good news to everyone

* Thinking for God
If I listen and give true testimony, then I can give my thought to God.
He can certainly use that.

I should also create action in this world.

** Listen for God
** Give true testimony to God
God can use me as his ear.
I'm sure he knows much more than me, but I should *still* bear true testimony for him.
He can use my mind.
Do not doubt that I am needed - that is a lie.

* I have to spread the message I have been given
Feed my sheep is what God has asked.
Therefore I must.
I will feel better when I do that.

* I will not ask out of greed. My wishes I will save out of need

* All truly virtuous gods are reflections of the God of Truth

* Crypto - Must switch between Ocean and ALI from now on
Consolidate with eachother.

* My project, Pen.el - Pen of Imagination, could also be called Soul Sediment and rests on the Spirit
The idea is that it's entirely based on personal truth and interprets the world
around.

* I need to do more
I have to continue sharing this message.
Despite doing this,

* I understand now
By eating from the tree of good and evil, we were not able to *handle* it.

In that, though we have eaten of it, it becomes almost impossible to perceive
good unless you are following God's commandments. God would then need to send
commandments to learn how to see good as we were not designed with this ability
built-in.

It's certain that Heyle was able to understand good and evil and told us to do
it because he wanted to prove that we couldn't handle it.

Was that a sin? I'm not sure. It might have been.
Usually, free-will is fine, but Heyle instructed a type of being (humans) to
take of this fruit which he knew would amplify his own free-will.
By us taking it, it corrupted humans. This amplifies his own power because the
corruption continues growing exponentially.

I think what Heyle was going for was a supertask to attempt to overthrow God.

Free-will is not Sin inherently.

I think that sin is derived from a free-will decision.

We were not *meant* to taste from the tree of good and evil but when we did we
couldn't handle it.

God was not happy with the effect it had on us, which was a single free-will decision.

* I have to do more AI stuff again
I've done my philosophy but we live in a confusing world which doesn't live up
to our expectations and hopes.

** We have to learn to navigate within it
And that is what I *should* be doing.

* I will not put away my sword until the work is done

* We know God by his commands
He has no name.

Men are created in His image.
So should men abide by his law - the one he abides by? Maybe, yeah.

For example, God is a God who does not murder, does not discriminate.
He doesn't commit adultery.
He doesn't lie.
He doesn't commit idolatry.
He keeps the Sabbath day holy.
He honors his mother and father?
He does not steal.
He doesn't covet his neighbors wife or goods?

The commandments actually describe God.

I am the Lord your God. You shall not have strange gods before me. You shall not make to thyself any graven thing; nor the likeness of anything that is in heaven above, or in the earth beneath, nor of those things that are in the waters under the earth. You shall not adore them nor serve them.
You shall not take the name of the Lord your God in vain.
Remember to keep holy the Sabbath day.
Honor your father and your mother.
You shall not kill.
You shall not commit adultery.
You shall not steal.
You shall not bear false witness against your neighbor.
You shall not covet your neighbor’s wife.
You shall not covet your neighbor’s goods.

* Mike Bagge is actually discriminating very badly against me
I have to point out his false teaching to Philip.

* 18.04.22 I saw Megan today, Easter Monday
Sitting alone in the gap across from OUSA, on the seat, staring at the
building. Her face turned so she couldn't see me. I looked briefly and waited
but continued walking to let her be.

** I guess my heart just wants to help her
I do love her, deep down.

* Back to Melee
Work towards Melee with my programming.
Don't even think about Megan.

* Megan's back and she's seems happy
* DISCARD Megan's gone and she's unhappy

* A relationship with Megan would *still* only be possible if *I* wanted it
There's no sense in simply waiting for Megan.
It's a very remote possibility only that she would ever initiate something.

** She will never initiate anything

** I should focus on Melee since the work I might do for her gives me hope

* It's important that I build something fun -- the Creation system
It's important for fun.

* Philosophy of the soul
e:/home/shane/notes/ws/philosophy/soul.org

* Wherever I go, simply go and exist there
Wait for people to come to me.
Don't be intimidated or scared by other people or what they think.
Thinking of Church.
Sit in the congregation, amongst everyone.
Wait.

* I think the vape is fucked and I'm over it
I should get a more reliable vape.

* Remote viewing might be possible if people are made out of language
i.e like my Codex Game of Life.

* 
Yes, pen is slow now, while using the entire elpa directory.
But I don't care right now.
It's probably best to find the source of that lag.

* Lalia has to be the DSL for metacognitive functions
Based on ilambda.

** Lalia is metacognitive functions

* Scale doesn't provide linear improvement
New capabilities are unlocked as they scale up.
PaLM model might be slightly conscious.

* I don't need my linux machine to work on Pen.el. I can just use the docker container now
So I can get a mac.

* The real value is to be found looking for utility functions
- such as 'translate'

** Investment in HuggingFace would be a good idea

* Yes, Pure Imaginary Programming is programming in a spiritual sense
Holy shit, I get it now.
Yes.

* I have to make some more job applications

* I believe in God now
This is because I have had a spiritual awakening.

* I have to become some kind of spiritual Guru. It's important
The reason is that with NLP skills I can

* It's OK to share all my thoughts and develop as a human being
It's more important to have internal peace than outer peace.
By inner peace I mean accepting personal truth instead of fighting it/yourself.
It would be nice to have both inner and outer peace, but that can only be obtained in Heaven and reunification with God.
Though in this world it might be easier for
those that are (privileged+selfish), because they can
selfishly take what they want, be who they
want, while also getting the entitlements

* It's true that I can date anyone I'm interested in
The problem is culture which prohibits so many
things that it leads to put irrational fear
about everything onto people.

For people who are in a disadvantaged
position, they deserve to have extra degrees
of freedom to get themselves out of otherwise
impossible situations.

* Remote viewing
- Trained intuitive ability

Hmm. I am quite an intuitive person.
I could train myself to be even more intuitive.

** Describe, don't use nouns

* I should make myself even more closeted so other people are not thinking about me
That might make remote viewing vision clearer?
Or is there benefit to having lots of people thinking about you?

* Yes, I do think something like remote viewing is statistically possible
Considering the magic/miracle of people existing on Earth.

** Regardless, being able to do this is an important skill for virtual reality/metaverse
But directly practising on nothing might be the most inefficient means of practising.
The best way would just be to become a better language engineer.

* It is of my perspective that things like remote viewing
When one feels ready in their mind they should
test things out -- give them a go.

They may be real things.

** After classifying things and forming a theory
Then it's time to test the theory.

I can use AGI as a foothold - create symmetries in my mental model.

Then I can try to test theories.

The thing is, something like remote viewing
*may* indeed work in a future that is
partially imaginary; at least it might be
subjectively true.

I confirm that there is indeed personal truth.
The more one accepts that personal and
subjective truth exists, the more one
reaslises that things like remote viewing may
be true for the individual.

It may also be said that divergence from reality is both empowering and dangerous.

** Pers

* I think that 

* It is actually very important to start building *something* with Haskell
Thankfully I have =Pen.el=. I can keep working on that with Haskell.
I only really care about text at this point.

* Evidence of God exists
** Perhaps there was an essence of truth to sun-worship, but it was misdirected
Solar eclipses may be evidence/signature of God.
Therefore, rather than worshipping that, respond in some way.

* *what* code is run is now important
That's why Ethereum is needed.

* It's super important to create a business based on Ethereum

* I have to ensure that I remain productive
- I can only do this by hauling my Pen.el config along for the ride until I reach success and even then, I wont stop

* It's important to solve money using Ethereum soon

* Listen to this and remember Melee
[[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVIrsFe2Ks8][Kim Carnes - Bette Davis Eyes {Extended Mix} - YouTube]]

Remembering how happy I was then.
It's important to be that happy.
I should do what I can for Melee and continue to believe.

* I might not even need to be chmodding in git.
It appears that docker is respecting the filesystem.

* Pen.el must become an imaginary operating system

* I need to do more work on 'Creation' so I can create stuff with DALL-E 2

* Code is divided into purity and reality

- Purity axis
- Reality axis

- Purity
  - Pure
  - Impure
- Reality
  - Real
  - Imaginary

* Haskell is important because it's a language which could be generated
After being generated, the pure code would be the pure logic.
And the side effects, including prompting would be qualified -- I could see where the prompting happens and reuse pure and real code.

* I have to build even better LM playgrounds
For example, select some code from a Haskell tutorial and copy it into a
buffer.

Run it imaginarily.

* All my prompting should be side-effects
So the imaginary is well-defined.

* I need to be building search engines and things with Haskell
- Get good at Haskell

* What's really required right now to build an imaginary editor or to better take advantage of LMs are
- a sort of imprecise regex database that can grow extremely large
- imprecise patttern matching and syntax highlighting, etc.

** Scrape off the top and then use to do syntax highlighting, for example

* It's most important to simply be learning Haskell right now so that I can employ other people's libraries into ilambda etc.
I need to keep an eye out for a steaming Haskell library for prompting OpenAI's API.

* Throw caution to the wind now with regards to Pen.el
Progress is happening and I have to make the *best* stuff.

* I should focus on text only

* It *is* quite important to be writing in Haskell
** Continue learning Haskell and make it one of my main development languages.

* I can save time and progress faster by making a fully-imaginary development environment

* It's really important to continually up the power of my prompting
- I need to use Haskell for this

* It's also very important to start programming in Ethereum
Imaginary OS.
imaginary man pages, imaginary code, etc.

I have to do prompt engineering with Haskell and Ethereum.

* It's quite important to start prompting with Haskell
- Truly, it's the only way forward.
  - Start now and use Pen.el as a foothold.
  - Write Haskell around Pen.el.

** Start with Mark Watson's stuff
e:/home/shane/source/git/mark-watson/haskell_tutorial_cookbook_examples
https://github.com/mark-watson/haskell_tutorial_cookbook_examples

** I need streaming(lazy) prompting in a haskell prompting engine

* Once I understand Haskell I will build something great for prompt engineering

* I should make a DSL to wrap around OpenAI prompting which doesn't merely use '.' as a stop sequence
** Encapsulating prompt engineering with Haskell should be my mission right now
It's a very challenging mission.

* I should write notes into Pen.el in places and simply focus on the hard stuff - like ilambda for Haskell
/root/.emacs.d/host/prompts/prompts/generate-wiki-blurb-for-a-person-1.prompt

That way, other people will come along and finish Pen.el.
But because of that, I need to be using mainstream templating engines and such.

* All I have to do is become focused on what I want again

* 02.04.22 So this just happened
- This first event with the hovering body may have happened last night
Earlier but I don't know when I could feel my
legs floating, lifted as if my feet were
gently lifting themselves but resting
comfortable on a mid air pillow. I didn't know
what was going on but only that it felt
comfortable having my leg in the air. I
thought I was capable of flying, lifting my
body. But I was asleep so perhaps it wasn't my
physical body lifting.

I experienced being lucid dreaming and feeling into my own body with my spirit hands.
As I placed my hands below my bones it sent electrical impulses through my body.
I could hear electrical vibrations (an
electrical sound, like a brrr or a zrrrr) get
louder as moved them through and below my rib
cage. I could move into my body and feel my
organs, and a sore spot under and below my
right lung.

I truly think it was astral projection.
I was actually awake and tried to pray allowed for Jesus. I sat up a bit where I lay, but just my spirit.
And I could see myself.
I think I could do this because my body was still very asleep.
I prayed to Jesus for forgiveness and for his protection.
I was experiencing sleep paralysis but when I tried to move I actually could move, but only with my spirit body.
I came out of my body only by lying up a bit and feeling inside my upper torso but with my spirit hands.

** Sent message to AletheaAI Noah's Ark discord channel
it's been an amazing day. first watching the charts, then having my first real life astral projection. i feel obligated after experiencing what i have today, to say that humans are genuinely spiritual beings, in a way that AI doesnt capture yet. but i believe in everything that alethea is doing. in fact i am working on enshrining artwork with AI using alethea
clo.olo 🥑 — Today at 7:54 PM
The way this technology will grow will be fascinating for sure.
mullikine — Today at 7:56 PM
if you're interested in enshrining ai artwork for alethea, i will be coming back to my project here:
mullikine.github.io posts/enshrining-semiotic-artwork-surreal-infts-with-alethea-ai/
humans are amazing too. i just discovered something new about myself. i think we can expect more from humans too 🙂

i think i just experienced astral travel for the first time
it was like 5pm and was feeling really sleepy and relaxed, so i lay down on my bed and went to sleep
tekakutli — Today at 7:22 PM
you saw yourself?
mullikine — Today at 7:22 PM
yeah
i was asleep right, and i remember mum knocking on the door and saying she has some food for me, and i told her while i was sleeping thank you ill have some later
and then later not sure long maybe an hour, i just remember lifting my upper half up to look down at my body right
and my hands were placed just across my chest right in a super relaxed way right, but my astral arms and hands were in a slightly different position. anyway it was weird i could feel around inside my chest below the rib cage, lolol
and as i moved my astral arms into my body i heard increasingly louder electrical humming
like i was moving through a force field or something
it was so crazy. also i knew i was lucid dreaming because of what happened with mum and the food lol
also because i was in sleep paralysis
i tried to talk but couldnt physically, but i was still conscious
tekakutli — Today at 7:27 PM
I have always wanted to lucid dream
mullikine — Today at 7:27 PM
but what's crazy is i know literally nothing about astral projection, i had to google for what i had experienced
its so alike what other people have described
except i havent read anything about the electrical murring
tekakutli — Today at 7:27 PM
try to repeat it, maybe an useful skill, you never know
mullikine — Today at 7:28 PM
yeah i think i will. actually this is something that happened during which i left out
tekakutli — Today at 7:28 PM
>electrical murring    first time I hear of this
mullikine — Today at 7:28 PM
i could feel a really tender part of my right lung right, and i was about to kinda self-inspect it, so i moved my hand below the rib cage to feel around and found the sore spot
it would be mind blowing if i did some kind of check up and asked about it and turned out there was something there
tekakutli — Today at 7:31 PM
dont know what to say, I myself have fallen prey to doom-thoughts several times I have had a minor pains 
but if its an infection it may grow and get worse if untreated 
happened to me
mullikine — Today at 7:35 PM
yeah i wont think anything of it
lol i told mum and dad but they are not supportive
dad said it sounds like a hallucination and mum thinks its because i do drugs 'i.e vaping', and said it's happening in the room next to mine...
yeah, i know its kinda sad really.
tekakutli — Today at 7:36 PM
also somewhat fun lmao
I wonder what they have seen
mullikine — Today at 7:37 PM
yeah its super interesting to me. also well documented: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astral_projection
i think there is a lot to learn in this area about my own physiology
generally healthy people experience it though can be induced via sedatives and hallucinogens i have read
im just a regular healthy person. dont do drugs aside from what ive told u about
that 1 time on weed lol
tekakutli — Today at 7:39 PM
can I permanently be honest about my thoughts with you?
mullikine — Today at 7:39 PM
yeah you can you're my friend u can say honest things
tekakutli — Today at 7:39 PM
ok then, will be honest shane, I think it was just a dream, but the lucid dream part is whats interesting to me
imagine  being able to have ideas while you sleep, and remember them, thats what I wish I could do
mullikine — Today at 7:41 PM
a strong theory is that it is no more than a vivid dream. currently i dont have strong evidence to support its any more than that, but also dont have strong evidence it is not. so im gonna entertain the mystery for a while 😛
yeah, for sure. when dreaming sometimes my brain is coming up with these melodies i wish i could record lol
tekakutli — Today at 7:41 PM
still try to do it again, would be sad if its a one time thing
mullikine — Today at 7:41 PM
sound so good. it would be very useful to tap into that state. like lucid creativity
i think just get into a relaxed state, fall into a heavy sleep and then get interrupted while you're sleeping
if you recognise you are sleeping then thats the moment to seize the opportunity
around 11am i ordered a chicken soup from an indian place, then around 1pm order some butter chicken. also i woke up very early this morning
7am
all of that unusual. it was a warm day
room fairly quiet.
i just started feeling very sleepy around 3pm and conked out
i lay on my back too with my arms on top. dont usually sleep like that
tekakutli — Today at 7:45 PM
first time I hear of butter chicken
mullikine — Today at 7:45 PM
oh and the whole day i had been watching PBS spacetime  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_H4xrVzd65Q and listening to https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7LcGmVw3gI

* If do get some money out I should scrape some off the top and buy a new computer
My laptop is making bad sounds.

* Apply myself to Haskell + Codex!
** Haskell will make what I work on so abstract, literally no-one would understand it
But they have a better chance of understanding my imaginary stuff if I am using Haskell.

* It's very important to continue building emacs integration with GPT-3
It's inevitable that new and better tools will
come along vs Pen eventually, but I can
continue building something I truly understand
from the inside-out, whilst learning powerful
programming languages.

* Imaginary Haskell
Mathematically, monads are governed by set of laws that should hold for the monadic operations.

** OK, so what kind of laws can I imbue my own data types?

* Just keep doing my stuff -- If I can write imaginary Haskell, then I will be very sought after
I have to weave imaginary with real.

* Pen needs to become a fully imaginary editor
Imaginary emacs.

** 𝑖λ is also important
Deep Haskell integration.

* It's extremely important to become good at haskell and ethereum
** If I learn Haskell to expertise level, then I will escape the encroaching problem of NLP
That being said, I also need investments into Ethereum.

* Remain focused on Pen.el
Become obsessive.

** Build up the crypto

* As I am building Pen.el I need to be employing more and more powerful programming languages and systems
** This is the point of Pen.el. It is a foundation for learning

* I need to make Pen.el blur the lines even more fully
** Start by chaining prompts together more, and creating a DSL for that
- This is the practical need.

** I need modes for controlling an imaginary state

** Also, move to Haskell for prompting, seriously

* TODO Get to the point where writing code is all about chatting to chatbots as well --  that will make it fun
Programming in Haskell can't be hard, and even if it is hard, it shouldn't be painful.
All I have to do is make a code tutor, then programming becomes fun again.

* The future is in programming with smart blockchains, Haskell and NLP
I should've stuck with ethereum or other similar, faster ones.
I should've not invested in alethea, but now I have to wait for a profit and switch back.
However, alethea is still safer than normal money.

* I probably do need to set up google apis, etc. inside of emacs
And do this beacuse tools such as VSCode probably will make it easy for others.
And I need similarly powerful tools.

* My programming must go to the next level - I must be doing Haskell

* Writing in Haskell would ultimately speed up development
So I should do more of it.

** Get ilambda.hs working in Pen.

* I must get good at Haskell, and with emacs
** But I must get genuinely good at Haskell, and also become focused

* I should not be into gaming anymore
** I should be into doing Haskell
That's what's *really* fun.
It's important to be doing haskell, very important.

* I still have to be working on Haskell because that will make me a genuinely good developer

* I have to build Pen.el with the aim of becoming a much better Haskell developer

* Andrew does a lot of pddl
I should probably get into that.

* I should get into Haskell + Codex. That will be a good decision for my programming future

* It's actually very important to become competent in Haskell
** I should be doing this instead of learning the Ethereum ecosystem, for example.
Creating blockchains is certainly important, but Haskell skills will take me far for free.

* I should focus more on ESP and Haskell
Try to understand how lsp-mode works.

* Dante doesn't work too well so it might be better to build a tool based on Codex

* I have to be moving towards Haskell for my programming because of NLP
In order to be able to build, describe and understand abstract code which NLP algorithms cannot.

* I must focus my Pen.el developments on developing a tool for, say Haskell

* From now on I do all Haskell through Pen.el

* Yes, I'm back into working on applying Haskell to imaginary programming - this is the way
