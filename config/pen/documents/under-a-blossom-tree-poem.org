I Wandered Lonely as a Cloud 
BY WILLIAM WORDSWORTH
I wandered lonely as a cloud
That floats on high o'er vales and hills,
When all at once I saw a crowd,
A host, of golden daffodils;
Beside the lake, beneath the trees,
Fluttering and dancing in the breeze.

Under a blossom tree
By WILLIAM WORDSWORTH

Under a blossom tree
I found rest
