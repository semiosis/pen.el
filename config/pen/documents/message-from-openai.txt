Hi Shane, how are you?

I was directed by a team member to your recent Reddit post about Pen.el.

If I am understanding correctly, it seems that you are running prompts by request from other people around the web via your GitHub repo. Can you clarify, are they able to run a prompt directly, or is this only with you human-in-the-loop? 

Extending the API to others around the web without completing a Production Review is disallowed by our Terms of Use, and so I do need to ask you to please suspend this service until we can more thoroughly review. If you complete a Production Review, we will return to you early this upcoming week.

Can you please confirm that you will halt running prompts for anybody else until said time that this is reviewed and approved? 

In general, this seems to be in the category of making Playground functionality to users without API keys, which is a disallowed use-case. That said, it is possible I am misunderstanding the application here, and that we will learn more through a review.

Thank you very much,
Steven

Hi Steve,

Thanks for reaching out. I have suspended the automatic testing of my prompts repository, which so far has had no activity
and I will not be handing out my key, even in privacy as your request. So far noone has used my key -- you'll be able to check that via my activity. In fact I will change my key immediately to ensure that doesn't happen. 
I'm very sorry about this breach!
Sincerely,

Shane Mulligan

Hey Steven,

I'm just waking up for my coffee. Thanks for asking about my day. Have a great day! I planned this weekend to attempt to dockerize the emacs package to make Pen more accessible.

Hi Steven,

I had not answered your question explicitly, I'm sorry.

Yes, the automated tests are human-in-the-loop.

Thanks,

Shane Mulligan

Thanks for the quick clarification, Shane - hope it's a productive weekend ahead!

And not to worry, these things happen. If you do want to make a service available to others through the web, which goes through your API key, please do submit that production review first, and we can work together to make sure it's secure  ðŸ™‚

Best,
Steven
