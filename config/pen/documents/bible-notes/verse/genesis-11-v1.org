** Genesis 10 recap:
- Noah's descendants repopulated the world from the middle-east. They spread out.

** Genesis 11

God's ordinance is that mankind spreads out and multiplies.

Quote from my friend Quinn (at Adson's flat), "God's will is going to be done. If we don't resist it then it will be a blessing to us and if we resist it then it will be a curse to us."

Noah:
- Japheth
- Ham
- Shem
  - Abraham

*** Tower of Babel
They turned into 'Auckland'.
They forgot the mission - God's ordinance is that mankind spreads out and multiplies.
They wanted to make a name for *themselves* (selfish) outside of God's plan, that would last forever.

Genesis 11:4
God dispersed the people.

*** Rainbow
I'll never make a flood again to destroy the earth.
God was faithful and did not wipe out humanity again with a flood.

God saved Noah but humanity's relationship with God is still broken.
