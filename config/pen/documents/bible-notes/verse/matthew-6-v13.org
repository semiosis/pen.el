Didache has the longer ending.

https://www.earlychristianwritings.com/text/didache-roberts.html

Our Father who art in heaven, hallowed be Thy name. Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done on earth, as it is in heaven.
Give us today our daily (needful) bread, and forgive us our debt as we also forgive our debtors. And bring us not
into temptation, but deliver us from the evil one (or, evil); for Thine is the power and the glory for ever..
