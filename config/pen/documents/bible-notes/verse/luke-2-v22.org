Mosaic law provided Israel a series of
commands relating to ceremonial purity.

One of these regulations involved childbirth,
and here Mary and Joseph are completing the
required purification (Leviticus 12).

[[bible:Leviticus 12]]

This cleansing is not an atonement for sin,
but a symbolic restoration of purity.

Leviticus 12:1-4
‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾
And YHWH spake unto Moses, saying, Speak unto
the children of Israel, saying, If a woman
have conceived seed, and born a man child:
then she shall be unclean seven days;
according to the days of the separation for
her infirmity shall she be unclean.

And in the eighth day the flesh of his
foreskin shall be circumcised.

And she shall then continue in the blood of
her purifying three and thirty days; she shall
touch no hallowed thing, nor come into the
sanctuary, until the days of her purifying be
fulfilled.
