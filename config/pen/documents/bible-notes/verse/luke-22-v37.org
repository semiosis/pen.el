** Kingdom of heaven
This here is the correct explanation for the swords:

It's nothing to do with self-defense, but about prophesy fulfillment.

Normally, Jesus wants us to rely on God to provide everything for us as
we preach the Kingdom of heaven.

Jesus only asked his disciples to carry belongings for the event
[[bible:Luke 22:52]] where the chief priests and officers of the temple
would help fulfill one of the prophesies "And He was numbered with
transgressors" [[bible:Isaiah 53:12]].

And as you go, preach, saying, ‘The kingdom of
heaven is at hand.’ Heal the sick, raise the
dead, cleanse the lepers, cast out demons.

Freely you received, freely give.

Do not acquire gold, or silver, or copper for
your money belts, or a bag for your journey,
or even two coats, or sandals, or a staff; for
the worker is worthy of his support.

And He said to them, “When I sent you out
without money belt and bag and sandals, you
did not lack anything, did you?” They said,
“No, nothing.” And He said to them, “But now,
whoever has a money belt is to take it along,
likewise also a bag, and whoever has no sword
is to sell his coat and buy one.

For I tell you that this which is written must
be fulfilled in Me, ‘And He was numbered with
transgressors’; for that which refers to Me
has its fulfillment.” They said, “Lord, look,
here are two swords.” And He said to them, “It
is enough.”
