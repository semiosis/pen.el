It's Dad's 77th birthday today.
Dad's over there for 7 days.
I stumbled across Genesis 7 today.
It's full of sevens.
Anthony stopped me before coming to John Watson's house tonight for 'equippers'.
He came up to me and said I look like I'm about 70 years old.
I then told him.

Praise the LORD!

Thank You for saving me Jesus.
Thank You for saving US!
