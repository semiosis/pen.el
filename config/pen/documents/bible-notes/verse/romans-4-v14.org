* Romans 4:14-16
These verses show that the Mosaic law can be followed while simultaneously having faith - they are not mutually exclusive.

But faith is required to receive the promise of grace.
Someone who adheres to the Mosaic law, if they have faith too receive the grace.

Faith is more important to have.
In fact the promice of grace only goes to those who exercise Faith.
