Maintain faithfulness.
Read the scriptures - Jesus' commandments especially, and when tested on them, be faithful to Jesus!
It's about works done in faithfulness to Jesus.
But I believe that from the beginning one must realise that all works are given as gifts.
The works don't make me justified before God.
God has already justified me and given me grace.
But it's faith for me to continue being obedient to God.
The works are done in faith, and come from wanting to give grace to others, as I have
freely received, so I must give in obedience to Jesus, displaying the character of
a true disciple of Jesus.
