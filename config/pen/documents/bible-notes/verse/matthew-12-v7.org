If a person is *actually* allowing mercy/compassion then they would not have made the mistake of condemning someone who is innocent.

They didn't know that Jesus was the Son of Man and Lord of the Sabbath.
Jesus was actually abiding by the law.
And if the Pharisees were truly allowing mercy and compassion
then they wouldn't have condemned the innocent.
