I think that the correct interpretation of what happened regarding
the Law of commandments is that in Christ Jesus the law of
commandments no longer condemn one-another, but on the condition that those
involved are indeed in Christ Jesus, having been saved by grace through faith - fulfilling the law by loving one-another.

Outside of Christ Jesus, the law still creates enmity.
