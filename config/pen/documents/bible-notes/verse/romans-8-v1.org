“I am the true vine, and My Father is the
vinedresser.

Every branch in Me that does not bear fruit,
He takes away; and every branch that bears
fruit, He prunes it so that it may bear more
fruit.

You are already clean because of the word
which I have spoken to you.

Abide in Me, and I in you.

As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself
unless it abides in the vine, so neither can
you unless you abide in Me.

I am the vine, you are the branches; he who
abides in Me and I in him, he bears much
fruit, for apart from Me you can do nothing.

If anyone does not abide in Me, he is thrown
away as a branch and dries up; and they gather
them, and cast them into the fire and they are
burned.

If you abide in Me, and My words abide in you,
ask whatever you wish, and it will be done for
you.

* About few weeks ago
I remember the vision of Chen lying down and me lying on him and Romans 8:1.

* Romans 8 is where it's at

Chen tried to get in contact with me today.

I could tell Chen my story.

I remember seeing Zoe, Reuben's friend, at Wakari.

* Now, waking up yesterday (I think it was yeterday or the day before)
I had a vision which just said

* Also this morning's vision was Pharaoh and a waterfall
and a boat climbing tiers of a waterfall.
