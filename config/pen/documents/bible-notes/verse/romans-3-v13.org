I had a vision some time this year of Nellie
saying my mouth smells like a graveyard.

This is so interesting.
I honestly don't think the dream was from the LORD.
I've had lots of dreams which are accusatory.
It's really hard to know.
But, regardless, I need to take every thought captive for Christ.

The dream reminds me of this verse.
At the time I didn't know the verse, but I had the dream.
