** amazonica
Don't use this. It's just a wrapper over java libraries. It's not a great abstraction.
Google-driven development is still a problem.

** pure-clojure alternatives
This is better.

** clojure.spec

** What we really want
- idiomatic clojure
- data-oriented
  - Not just talking about map-in map-out
- async primary
  - Don't want to do bindings.
  - Just have it as a function argument
- discoverability at the repl
- docs in the repl
- direct communication with AWS via HTTP
- pay as you go
  - don't want to depend on things that we're not going to use
    - separate artifact for each service
