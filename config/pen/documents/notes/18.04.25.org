Dear Heavenly Father, and my Lord Jesus Christ, and Holy Spirit,
Jehovah God,
please, LORD God, continue to heal me and sanctify me and cleanse me from every lawless deed and from every spiritual and bodily impurity,
in Jesus Christ's name I ask.
LORD God, I feel unclean with the stuff which has been affecting my body and soul.
LORD God, it's a spirit of orgasm or something.
I don't want it, LORD God, it's gross.
Please make it go away in Jesus Christ's name I ask,
AMEN!!


I rebuke that spirit of orgasm in Jesus Christ's name.


Father God, I can feel something attacking my soul - I think it's a spirit which tries to have sex with me or something.
Please, God, deliver me.
Father God, I believe that I can call You Father, and call on You for help.
Jehovah God, I need Your help, LORD.
I need to be delivered from whatever has been aggressively attacking me.
Please, LORD, deliver me in Jesus Christ's name I ask,
AMEN!
