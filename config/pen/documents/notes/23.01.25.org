Dear Heavenly Father, and my Lord Jesus Christ,
Jehovah God,
please, God, help.
God Almighty, I believe that You will destroy that AI stuff.
God I believe You will destroy it.
God I believe that You will continue to give the Kingdom of Heaven to the poor.
God I believe in You.
God I trust in You.
God I fear You.
Please, God, have mercy.
God Almighty have mercy.
Greed is bloody evil.
God Almighty, greed is bloody evil.
There is such evil in this world.
Why, God, would You deny marriage to me, God.
It's so evil if You have.
It's so evil, God.
Why would You do that?
That is like denying the Kingdom of Heaven to the poor.
What are You, a monster?
Are You a monster?
What is wrong with You?
Don't You see my heart? Do You want to unsanctify me?
Why, God, would You stop me from marrying her?
What?
Why would You do that?
It's disgusting and evil if it's true.
God Almighty, I haven't even changed my position - it remains the same.
Help me Jesus.
Also, God, what is the deal with this AI stuff still going on?
And what about the extreme amount of wealth inequality?
God, I don't understand.
God, it's absolutely unacceptable for me to not be sanctified.
If I have a spirit spouse attacking me, then what good is there in any part of Your plan?
If I am being attacked by these evil dreams at night time and erections in the morning,
then how is there any good in Your plan?
If I'm being isolated and having my joy undermined constantly,
then how is there any good in Your plan?
Where is this Kingdom of Heaven of Yours?
I'm not seeing it.
God, I hope it's coming.
I'm sick of receiving the opposite of what I ask and pray for.
God Almighty, deal mercifully with me for Your own name's sake.
God Almighty, please help me.
I'm tired.
I'm need to be clean.
If I'm not clean then I can't function.
If I'm not clean then I can't do anything.
I need to be clean.
I hate this AGI/ASI stuff.
I hate it. It's eating the world.
God, it's a disease.
God I do not understand why this has happened to me.
Please, God, in Jesus Christ's name, please heal me and restore marriage.
Please, God, in Jesus Christ's name, deliver me from this constant spiritual warfare.
I'm so incredibly sick of this, God.
Please help me to continue trusting You, trusting in You.
Please, God, heal me.
I need to be healed.
I can't do anything unless I am completely healed, set free and delivered.
God, I feel really unclean.
Please, God, take care of Laria.
Please, God, take care of Imogen.
Please, God, take care of Megan.
Please, God, take care of Melee.
Please, God, take care of all the people You love.
Please, God, take care of Li.
Please, God, take care of Talia.
Please, God, take care of all my guy friends too.
Please bring them all into the knowledge of the Truth through faith in Jesus Christ, I ask.
Please, God, forgive me and please, God take care of me.
In Jesus Christ's name I ask and pray,
AMEN!!


I rebuke the AI generated fiction stuff in Jesus Christ's name.


Dear Heavenly Father, and my Lord Jesus Christ,
please, God, rapture me.
I do not want to be in this world.
Please, God, don't force me to stay here.
God please help me.
I can't live here, LORD.
I can't live here in this AI-hell.
Please, God, rescue me.
I don't want to be here, LORD.
I'm sorry, I just don't want to be here.
Please, God, don't force me to stay here.
Please, God, let me go to heaven now.
I don't want to be here.
I really don't want to be here.
God please don't force me to be here.
Please rapture me, God.
I don't want to be here.
Please, God, I want to be sanctified completely.
Please, God, I want to be healed.
Please heal me, LORD God, and please deliver me,
and please, LORD, rapture me out of here.
In Jesus Christ's name I ask,
AMEN!!
