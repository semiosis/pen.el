Dear Heavenly Father, and my Lord Jesus Christ,
Jehovah God,
please, LORD God, deliver me (for the probably thousandth time I have asked)
from these strange and false and lying dreams, and all of
the spiritual attack and testing I've been hit with.
God, please rapture me.
I'm so sick of being in constant spiritual warfare.
It's awful.
It's definitely no way to live.
Please, God, help me.
Please deliver me.
I'm sick of this world.
It's a living hell.
Please deliver me from this world in Jesus Christ's name I ask,
AMEN!!

  Nu 12:6: And he said, Hear my words: If there is a prophet among you, I the Lord make myself known to him in a vision; I speak with him in a dream.
  Nu 12:7: Not so with my servant Moses. He is faithful in all my house.
  Nu 12:8: With him I speak mouth to mouth, clearly, and not in riddles, and he beholds the form of the Lord. Why then were you not afraid to speak against my servant Moses?
