I'm tired.


Dear Heavenly Father, and my Lord Jesus Christ and Holy Spirit,
Jehovah, Almighty God,
please, God, speak to me clearly.
I'm sick of being attacked by demons.
I want You to speak to me.
You promised that Holy Spirit would testify of You.
I want to hear that testimony.
I don't want demons attacking my mind and soul and relationship.
I do not want demons attacking me as they have.
Please deliver me in Jesus Christ's name, I ask,
AMEN!!
