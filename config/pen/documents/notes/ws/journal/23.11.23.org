This was a very interesting day.

I walked to the duck pond, but along the way Brittany from ALC called out to me.
I walked with her and talked about [[bible:I John 2:4]].
She told me I should visit Bill Berry in hospital some time - Bill from ALC.
I visted him later on in the day.
Brittany was there visiting him.
Brittany told me she was just reading from [[bible:Genesis 1:1-2]] (yesterday, I think).
Interestingly, Adson had just started the same Bible study with me last saturday - [[bible:Genesis 1:1-2]].



* TODO Try preaching to the ducks
(say Bible verses to the ducks)

This is what Bill Berry would do!

Bill told me today that he was ordained on 2 April 1987.
