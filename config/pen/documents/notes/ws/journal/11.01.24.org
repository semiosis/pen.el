Yesterday, Dad told me that Michael has probably moved out, as he no longer wants to work on the house.
I think the day before, also Trish from down the road told me something unusual - according to Trish,
mum and Michael had had a disagreement about the greenhouse, Michael saying that it belonged to him,
and Mum saying it was a gift from him. How odd. Do I believe this?
Perhaps I should not think too hard about this, or bring it up, since it very well may be spiritual.


Dear Heavenly Father, Jehovah God,
thank You for sending Michael to help with our house.
Please bless Michael.
Thank You God for Your mercy.
In Jesus Christ's name I ask and pray,
AMEN!!
