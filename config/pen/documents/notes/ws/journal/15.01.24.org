I think I should distance myself from Ian Dalziel as he seems extremely unhinged,
and I don't like the types of things he says.
As I went to Leith Valley Presbyterian church yesterday, he saw me along the way and stopped to pick me up.
In the car he said was that we are on a mission from God and he wants to blow himself up.
I think he is demon possessed.
So I'm going to just avoid that person because I do not want to be associated with him.
