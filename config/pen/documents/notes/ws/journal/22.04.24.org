It's Mum and Dad's anniversary today.

I get the impression that Jesus has abandoned me to be destroyed by evil spirits, or something.
I really just want Jesus to help me.
I don't understand it.

Whatever has happened to me since I was born-again is reprehensible.
I have no idea why it was allowed to happen to me - no idea at all.
I strongly disagree with the graceless nature of what has happened to me.
Firstly, the deliverance I received when I was born-again seemed to actually completely disregard actually protecting me against evil,
but, rather I was born-again and thrown to the wolves prematurely.
The situation with court was also extremely graceless and quite evil actually, considering that the objective seems to be to replace
a human wife with some kind of molesting spirit.
Yes, I disagree strongly with forbidding the marriage, and I rebuke it in Jesus Christ's name.
