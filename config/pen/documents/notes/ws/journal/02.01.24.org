I was walking towards the Dunedin City Library just thinking about how happiness is not one of the fruits of the spirit.
I was even thinking of how I should tell people who say things like, "As long as you're happy." that we should rather have joy.
Just as I was thinking that, a homeless person named Daniel called out to me, and asked me to come over to talk to him.
This man Daniel was 44 years old, he told me.
He was sitting on a bed (sleeping roll; pretty soft, actually) outside the Dunedin City Library.
He let me sit on his bed and talk to him for about 10 minutes.
He asked me if I smoke, drink, go after girls etc.
I said I stopped doing that.
He asked me what gives me joy.
I didn't respond, since I'm desolate.
He asked me why I am saving my money.
I said, "It makes me feel good when I give the money to others who need it."
He agreed.
He said, "Jesus didn't stay in the same place."
I responded saying, "He also told his disciples to do the same."
