* In waking life I've been assailed with falsehood through actual Christians denying certain things about Scripture

* In dreams I've been attacked with evil dreams and visions
Saying:
- they said 'this is the daily invasion' [of my body by demons]
- they said there is no god
- they said Jesus is not the messiah
- they said sumbit to the father [of lies and lawlessness]

Physical manifestations:
- Waking me up through the night to give me evil dreams
- Making me erect in the morning
- They gave me an evil dream saying it's trapping Melee in disgusting LGBT stuff

I rebuke them in Jesus Christ's name.

It's definitely not my fault.

* I have a problem
Well, firstly, the evil dreams are not my fault.
I have prayed for deliverance but not received deliverance from this, as far as I yet know.
My conscience is clear there.
