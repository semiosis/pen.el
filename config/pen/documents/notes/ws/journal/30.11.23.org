- I'm not going to throw an old friend under the bus, as asked through dreams this morning.
  - I'm going to pray for him instead.

- I'm not going to believe the deceptions I heard today, even the one telling me that I should not =uncarry= her.
  - Nor the one with the signpost, =joy=.
  - Nor the one where the person said used to want to be an apostle but the calling was too high.
  - Nor the one telling me there might be a suitable job for me which is not too difficult.

I rebuke that lying spirit in Jesus Christ's name.
