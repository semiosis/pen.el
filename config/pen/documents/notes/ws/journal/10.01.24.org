Today, sitting at the University Library, Albert walked underneath me as I was on the ledge in the libary, and he stopped and talked
to someone else under me.

Later, my Dad showed up in the same place below me and was talking to Roland Green on the phone about me.

Dad told me that I should not even bother with talking to the elders of Cornerstone church.

He also told me he had an argument with Paul Bernard once after he disagreed with Paul Bernard on theology.

At the same time as Dad was talking to me, Tom tried to talk to me.

After I left, I walked to the duck pond. Along the way I saw Ian.
I spoke to Ian. Ian said he does not believe in Jesus because of all the suffering in the world.
Ian said that Jesus is still dead.
I reminded Ian of the story of Joseph, and of my personal testimony.
Therefore, it appeared at that stage that Ian was not saved.


I have decided that I want to talk to the elders of Cornerstone church because:
- I'm already committed and I'm not afraid to come to the light about my testimony
- Roly has already agreed to have a meeting with me
- My testimony belongs to God


Dad has contacted Roland Green regarding the situation with me and Cornerstone church.
