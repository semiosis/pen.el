** Preparation
This precedes the actual notes.

e:/root/.pen/documents/notes/ws/discipleship-group/preparation

** D-group weekly devotional

** Memorization
e:/root/.pen/documents/notes/ws/discipleship-group/memorization

*** Ask the question, "What stood out to me?"

** Hear journals
e:/root/.pen/documents/notes/ws/discipleship-group/hear-journal

The HEAR-journal entry must be _per-highlighted-verse_.
I need to update the snippet and the filename to reflect
one HEAR-journal entry PER passage reflection.

Philippians 4:13

I can do all things through Him who
strengthens me.

*** E (Explain)
Pal was telling the church at Philippi that he has discovered the secret of contentment.
No matter the situation in Paul's life, he realized that Christ was all he needed, and
Christ was the One who strengthened him to persevere through difficult times.

*** A (Apply)
In my life, I will experience many ups and downs. My contentment is not found in circumstances.
Rather, it is based on my relationship with Jesus Christ. Only Jesus gives me the strength I need
to be content in every circumstance.

*** R (Respond)
Lord Jesus, please help me as I strive to be content in You. Through Your strength, I can
make it through any situation I face.
