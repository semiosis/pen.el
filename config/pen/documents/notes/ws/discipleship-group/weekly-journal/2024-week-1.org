While doing the reading, write bullet points about the story.
Take note of verses which stand out to me and think about what
the writer may have been experiencing when they wrote those verses.
Keep in mind the context of the verse.

Story bullet points (over entire reading):
- Luke is writing down his acccount of events surrounding Jesus Christ's life
  and ministry, having stated he has a perfect
  understanding from the beginning.
- Zacharias and his wife Elizabeth were walking in all the commandments
  and ordinances of the Lord blameless, but Elizabeth was barren and they
  became old but Gabriel, an angel of the Lord appeared to Zacharias,
  while Zacharias was on duty serving at the temple.
- I feel like Zacharias seemed like an ordinary old guy serving at the temple
  but who was following God's commandments but for a priest to be startled
  by a vision of an angel, and gripped by fear from it, he must not have
  experienced such things before.
- [[sh:bible-read-passage nasb Luke 1:16]]
  And he will turn many of the sons of Israel back to the Lord their God.
- Zacharias was told he would name the child John.
  The child, John, would be filled with the Holy Ghost, even from his
  mother's womb. However, John was not conceived by the Holy Ghost.
- Zacharias wanted further evidence, so Gabriel struck him dumb for his
  disbelief.
- Gabriel went to Mary next and told her she would bear the Son of God.

God lets you have joy and gladness in other things, but
it's true that this joy was a gift from God, which is what
the name 'John' means.

Also, the prayer was in alignment with God's will.

#+end_src

God's words never return to Him empty.
God's promises always come to pass.
When God decrees something, it always come to pass.
Nothing gets in the way of it.

Zacharias and Elizabeth served the Lord humbly.

Despite Zacharias's lapse of belief, him and his wife lived righteous
lives in the sight of God, and God still blessed them.
Indeed, God had decreed a blessing to them, and the blessing
was part of God's plan, and God wasn't going to relent on the blessing,
nor let anything get in the way of His plan coming to pass.

*** A (write down how I can [a]pply this Bible verse in my own life)
- I can live righteously in God's sight.
  - I can avoid idolatry, adultery, theft, hate, covetousness, pride,
    and every other thing the Lord hates.
  - I can keep God's commandments and decrees, his precepts.
- I can ask God for things that would give me joy.
  - But God is the one who provides them.
  - It glorifies God when we wait for God to provide for a want and God delivers.
  - It glorifies God when we wait for God, even when it might
    seem impossible, and then God delivers the impossible.
  - If I don't receive the gift through waiting for God to provide, then it's stealing - it doesn't glorify God.
- I can fear God, and serve God.
- I can believe God.
- I can have more faith in God.
- I can encourage others to walk in the attitude / wisdom of the just.
- I can expect God to win.

*** R ([r]espond to the LORD in prayer)

Dear Heavenly Father, Almighty Jehovah God,
please, God, forgive me for making incursions towards getting the things
I want, where I have not waited for You to provide them.
Please, God, let me be allowed to remain in that place of waiting on You to provide for me.
Please, God, help me to have the attitude and wisdom of the just, remaining faithful to your precepts, and Your commandments.
In Jesus Christ's name I ask,
AMEN!!

And Mary said, “Behold, the bondslave of the
Lord; may it be done to me according to your
word.” And the angel departed from her.

(NASB)
#+end_src

*** E ([e]xplain the context of the verse and what the writer may have been experiencing when they wrote it)

Mary had just been visited by the angel Gabriel.

- Mary was 'troubled' by the angel's words and wondered what kind
  of greeting it might be.
  - Unlike Zacharias, Mary was not gripped with fear by the angel, but
    by the angel's words.
- She believed Gabriel, and asked how it would happen.
  - Unlike Zacharias, she did not ask for more evidence.
- She recognised that she was not her own and belonged to the Lord.
- Her attitude was more righteous than consenting to the Lord,
  and it was never about consent. God had decreed something.
- But she already had given her life to God, and God knew this.
- She said, "May it happen to me according to your word."
- Her attitude was obedience.

*** A (write down how I can [a]pply this Bible verse in my own life)

As a servant of God, I can consider my life entirely owned by the Lord.
I can be more believing of God.
I can be more obedient to God.
I can be more trusting of that God's plan for me is better
than my own plans.

*** R ([r]espond to the LORD in prayer)

Dear Heavenly Father, Almighty Jehovah God,
please help me to live by faith in You and faithfulness to You, trusting
in You AND being faithful to You, and not have fear of what the pagans have fear of, which are materialistic concerns, but trusting in You that
Your plans are best, and that Your words are reliable, and Your promises
are reliable.
Please always hear me when I pray, so I can live in that knowledge
that You are always listening, and I can then live faithfully to
you with what You have already spoken.
Please forgive me for when I have come short of total service towards
You, and help me to live a more holy life.
In Jesus Christ's name I ask,
AMEN!!

“Do not think that I came to abolish the Law
or the Prophets; I did not come to abolish but
to fulfill.

For truly I say to you, until heaven and earth
pass away, not the smallest letter or stroke
shall pass from the Law until all is
accomplished.

Whoever then annuls one of the least of these
commandments, and teaches others to do the
same, shall be called least in the kingdom of
heaven; but whoever keeps and teaches them, he
shall be called great in the kingdom of
heaven.

“For I say to you that unless your
righteousness surpasses that of the scribes
and Pharisees, you will not enter the kingdom
of heaven.

“You have heard that the ancients were told,
‘You shall not commit murder’ and ‘Whoever
commits murder shall be liable to the court.’
But I say to you that everyone who is angry
with his brother shall be guilty before the
court; and whoever says to his brother, ‘You
good-for-nothing,’ shall be guilty before the
supreme court; and whoever says, ‘You fool,’
shall be guilty enough to go into the fiery
hell.

One of the criminals who hung there heaped
abuse on Him.

“Are You not the Christ?” he said.

“Save Yourself and us!” But the other one
rebuked him, saying, “Do you not even fear
God, since you are under the same judgment?

We are punished justly, for we are receiving
what our actions deserve.

But this man has done nothing wrong.” Then he
said, “Jesus, remember me when You come into
Your kingdom!” And Jesus said to him, “Truly I
tell you, today you will be with Me in
Paradise.”

Geoff:
- Fear God, His mercy will be for me. Humble myself to Him.

*** E ([e]xplain the context of the verse and what the writer/people in the story may have been experiencing when they wrote/experienced it)

Mary's soul was exalting the Lord and rejoicing in God her Saviour.
Mary was also fearing the Lord and humbling herself before God.

*** A (write down how I can [a]pply this Bible verse in my own life)
Continue to fear God:
- Do not take lightly his commandments and precepts.
- Always try to remain faithful to God.
Humble myself before God.

*** R ([r]espond to the LORD in prayer)

Dear Heavenly Father, Almighty Jehovah God,
Please, God, please help me to have the faithfulness of
Mary in my life, even when I'm going through life
without being under intense supervision. Father God,
Please help me to have the faithful trust
that Mary had and hand over my entire life to You,
that You may do with me as You will.
Please, Father God, I am so sorry for [in my own life situations]
coming short of the faithfulness and faith and trust towards You
that Mary has exemplified.
Please forgive me, LORD.
I want to be more trusting.
I want to be more faithful.
Please forgive me, LORD.
In Jesus Christ's name I ask,
AMEN!!

The peace that the angels were declaring God gives
comes to those on whom His favor rests.
This peace is only for those on whom His favour rests.
God decides who gets his favour and the peace which He gives.

Identity preceeds instructions.
This is what Geoff is saying.
Identity in Christ is crucial, as Jesus' identity in His Father is crucial.
