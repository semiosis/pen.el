While doing the reading, write bullet points about the story.
Take note of verses which stand out to me and think about what
the writer may have been experiencing when they wrote those verses.
Keep in mind the context of the verse.

** Prayer
Dear Heavenly Father, Almighty Jehovah God,
thank You for giving us the opportunity to study the words which
You have spoken through Your prophets.
Thank You for giving us the opportunity to come focus on the
Truth which is Your Word which has been revealed in Christ Jesus our Lord.
Thank You for giving us the opportunity to be a light to others.
In Jesus Christ's name, I pray,
AMEN!!

TODO Also, consider getting chapter headings from the chapter headings list.

Write bullet points for each of the readings, and optionally sub-bullet-points applications for applying to or making comparisons to my own life.

Abraham came near and said, “Will You indeed
sweep away the righteous with the wicked?

Suppose there are fifty righteous within the
city; will You indeed sweep it away and not
spare the place for the sake of the fifty
righteous who are in it?

Far be it from You to do such a thing, to slay
the righteous with the wicked, so that the
righteous and the wicked are treated alike.

Far be it from You! Shall not the Judge of all
the earth deal justly?” So the LORD said, “If
I find in Sodom fifty righteous within the
city, then I will spare the whole place on
their account.” And Abraham replied, “Now
behold, I have ventured to speak to the Lord,
although I am but dust and ashes.

(NASB)
#+end_src

**** E (explain)
Abraham was reasoning about what the LORD would do,
and he legitimately asked God a question, and then found
that God responded to him, and Abraham humbled himself.

**** A (apply)
Firstly, I am allowed to reason about what God may do,
yet, I must have the humility which Abraham had before God, the LORD.

**** R (respond)

Dear Heavenly Father, Almighty Jehovah God,
I am but dust and ashes.
Please, God, have mercy on me because I have ventured to
speak to You, although I am but dust and ashes, though
You have given to me a new spirit.
Yet, have mercy on me, LORD, and forgive me for speaking
presumtuously.
Please deliver me from the evil spirits which harass me.
Please deliver me so that I no longer pray frustratingly to
You, Father God.
In Jesus Christ's name I ask,
AMEN!!

Sarah denied it however, saying, “I did not
laugh”; for she was afraid.

And He said, “No, but you did laugh.”

(NASB)
#+end_src

**** E (explain)
Sarah was afraid and lied, but the LORD asserts the truth and reality of what happened.

**** A (apply)
- Being afraid isn't really an excuse to lie.
- 

I believe that Amelia Dowle has felt confused and perhaps her lies started to snowball.
If that is because she was afraid, well, the LORD is still just to rebuke that.
Now, the same principle applies to me, and the LORD is just to correct any error.
AMEN.

**** R (respond)

Dear Heavenly Father, Almighty Jehovah God,
