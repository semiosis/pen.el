While doing the reading, write bullet points about the story.
Take note of verses which stand out to me and think about what
the writer may have been experiencing when they wrote those verses.
Keep in mind the context of the verse.

** Readings bullet points
Write bullet points for each of the readings, and optionally sub-bullet-points applications for applying to or making comparisons to my own life.

*** H.E.A.R journal entry for verse [[sh:bible-study-passage nasb Titus 1-3 ][Titus 1-3]]
**** H (highlight)
#+BEGIN_SRC bash -n :i bash :async :results verbatim code :lang text
  nasb Titus 1-3
#+END_SRC

What does Paul mean by this?

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *Titus 1:15* - To the pure, all things are pure, but to the defiled and unbelieving, nothing is pure; but both their minds and their consciences are defiled. (ESV)
#+END_QUOTE

Paul doesn't mean 'sin' is pure:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *Titus 1:10* - For there are many who are insubordinate, empty talkers and deceivers, especially those of the circumcision party. (ESV)
#+END_QUOTE

Paul was simply rebuking being of the flesh:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *Titus 1:13-14* - This testimony is true. Therefore rebuke them sharply, that they may be sound in the faith, not devoting themselves to Jewish myths and the commands of people who turn away from the truth. (ESV)
#+END_QUOTE

But in the same passage Paul encourages people to be holy:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *Titus 1:7-9* - For an overseer, as God's steward, must be above reproach. He must not be arrogant or quick-tempered or a drunkard or violent or greedy for gain, but hospitable, a lover of good, self-controlled, upright, holy, and disciplined. He must hold firm to the trustworthy word as taught, so that he may be able to give instruction in sound doctrine and also to rebuke those who contradict it. (ESV)
#+END_QUOTE

**** E (explain)

**** A (apply)

**** R (respond)

Dear Heavenly Father, Almighty Jehovah God,
