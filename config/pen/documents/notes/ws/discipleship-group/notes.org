Now we have received, not the spirit of the
world, but the Spirit who is from God, so that
we may know the things freely given to us by
God, which things we also speak, not in words
taught by human wisdom, but in those taught by
the Spirit, combining spiritual thoughts with
spiritual words.

But a natural man does not accept the things
of the Spirit of God, for they are foolishness
to him; and he cannot understand them, because
they are spiritually appraised.
