Testament.

As you study these commandments (orders) of
Jesus it will become evident that God is not
only the God of Grace, He is also the God of
expectations.

Obeying the Commandments of Jesus will bring
rewards.

For example, “Ye must be born again”,
is considered to be one of the Commandments of
Jesus.

Those who obey receive Eternal Life! The Old
Testament Commandments beautifully teach what
God considers to be sin, but they require
perfection, and no person has ever been
perfect (good enough), so it can only bring
condemnation.

However, Jesus, being the "Son of God" and
therefore perfect, could and did live up to
the requirements of the Old Testament Law, and
by doing so was qualified to die in the place
of all who would accept Him as their Savior.

“Teacher, which is the great commandment in
the Law?” And He said to him, “ ‘You shall
love the Lord your God with all your heart,
and with all your soul, and with all your
mind.’ This is the great and foremost
commandment.

The second is like it, ‘You shall love your
neighbor as yourself.’ On these two
commandments depend the whole Law and the
Prophets.”

And Jesus answered saying to them, “Have faith
in God.

Truly I say to you, whoever says to this
mountain, ‘Be taken up and cast into the sea,’
and does not doubt in his heart, but believes
that what he says is going to happen, it will
be granted him.

Therefore I say to you, all things for which
you pray and ask, believe that you have
received them, and they will be granted you.

Jesus replied and said, “A man was going down
from Jerusalem to Jericho, and fell among
robbers, and they stripped him and beat him,
and went away leaving him half dead.

And by chance a priest was going down on that
road, and when he saw him, he passed by on the
other side.

Likewise a Levite also, when he came to the
place and saw him, passed by on the other
side.

But a Samaritan, who was on a journey, came
upon him; and when he saw him, he felt
compassion, and came to him and bandaged up
his wounds, pouring oil and wine on them; and
he put him on his own beast, and brought him
to an inn and took care of him.

On the next day he took out two denarii and
gave them to the innkeeper and said, ‘Take
care of him; and whatever more you spend, when
I return I will repay you.’ Which of these
three do you think proved to be a neighbor to
the man who fell into the robbers’ hands?” And
he said, “The one who showed mercy toward
him.” Then Jesus said to him, “Go and do the
same.”

saying, “This cup which is poured out for you
