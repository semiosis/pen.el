2Co 3:1-5	Lest their false teachers should charge him with vain glory, he shows the faith  and graces of the Corinthians to be a sufficient commendation of his ministry.
2Co 3:6-11	Whereupon entering a comparison between the ministers of the law and of the  gospel,
2Co 3:12-18	he proves that his ministry is so far the more excellent, as the gospel of life  and liberty is more glorious than the law of condemnation.

2 Corinthians chapter 4
2Co 4:1-6	He declares how he has used all sincerity and faithful diligence in preaching  the gospel,
2Co 4:7-11	and how the troubles and persecutions which he daily endured for the same did  redound to the praise of God's power,
2Co 4:12-15	to the benefit of the church,
2Co 4:16-18	and to the apostle's own eternal glory.

2 Corinthians chapter 5
2Co 5:1-8	That in his assured hope of immortal glory,
2Co 5:9-11	and in expectation of it, and of the general judgment, he labours to keep a good  conscience;
2Co 5:12-13	not that he may herein boast of himself,
2Co 5:14-17	but as one that, having received life from Christ, endeavours to live as a new  creature to Christ only,
2Co 5:18-21	and by his ministry of reconciliation, to reconcile others also in Christ to  God.

2 Corinthians chapter 6
2Co 6:1-2	That he has approved himself a faithful minister of Christ by his exhortations,
2Co 6:3	and by integrity of life,
2Co 6:4-9	and by patient enduring all kinds of affliction and disgrace for the gospel.
2Co 6:10-12	Of which he speaks the more boldly amongst them because his heart is open to  them,
2Co 6:13	and he expects the like affection from them again;
2Co 6:14-18	exhorting them to flee the society and pollutions of idolaters, as being  themselves temples of the living God.

2 Corinthians chapter 7
2Co 7:1	He proceeds in exhorting them to purity of life;
2Co 7:2	and to bear him like affection as he does to them.
2Co 7:3-12	Whereof lest he might seem to doubt, he declares what comfort he took in his  afflictions by the report which Titus gave of their godly sorrow, which his  former epistle had wrought in them;
2Co 7:13-16	and of their loving-kindness and obedience toward Titus, answerable to his  former boastings of them.

2 Corinthians chapter 8
2Co 8:1-6	He stirs them up to a liberal contribution for the poor saints at Jerusalem, by  the example of the Macedonians;
2Co 8:7-8	by commendation of their former forwardness;
2Co 8:9-13	by the example of Christ;
2Co 8:14-15	and by the spiritual profit that shall redound to themselves thereby;
2Co 8:16-24	commending to them the integrity and willingness of Titus, and those other  brethren, who upon his request, exhortation, and commendation, were purposely  come to them for this business.

2 Corinthians chapter 9
2Co 9:1-5	He yields the reason why, though he knew their forwardness, yet he sent Titus  and his brethren beforehand.
2Co 9:6-9	And he proceeds in stirring them up to a bountiful alms, as being but a kind of  sowing of seed,
2Co 9:10-12	which shall return a great increase to them,
2Co 9:13-15	and occasion a great sacrifice of thanksgivings unto God.

2 Corinthians chapter 10
2Co 10:1-6	Against the false apostles, who disgraced the weakness of his person and bodily  presence, he shows the spiritual might and authority with which he was armed  against all adverse powers;
2Co 10:7-11	assuring them that at his coming he will be found as mighty in word as he is now  in writing, being absent;
2Co 10:12-18	and withal taxing them for reaching out themselves beyond their compass, and  vaunting themselves of other men's labours.

2 Corinthians chapter 11
2Co 11:1-4	Out of his jealousy over the Corinthians, who seemed to make more account of the  false apostles than of him, he enters into a forced commendation of himself,
2Co 11:5-6	of his equality with the chief apostles,
2Co 11:7-12	of his preaching the gospel to them freely, and without any charge to them;
2Co 11:13-22	shewing that he was not inferior to those deceitful workers in any legal  prerogative;
2Co 11:23-33	and in the service of Christ, and in all kinds of sufferings for his ministry,  far superior.

2 Corinthians chapter 12
2Co 12:1-8	For commending of his apostleship, though he might glory of his wonderful  revelations,
2Co 12:9-10	yet he rather chooses to glory of his infirmities;
2Co 12:11-13	blaming them for forcing him to this vain boasting.
2Co 12:14-19	He promises to come to them again; but yet altogether in the affection of a  father;
2Co 12:20-21	although he fears he shall to his grief find many offenders, and public  disorders there.

2 Corinthians chapter 13
2Co 13:1-4	He threatens severity, and the power of his apostleship, against obstinate  sinners.
2Co 13:5-6	And, advising them to a trial of their faith,
2Co 13:7-10	and to a reformation of their sins before his coming,
2Co 13:11-14	he concludes his epistle with a general exhortation and a prayer.

Ga 4:14-21	He remembers their good will to him, and his to them;
Ga 4:22-31	and shows that we are the sons of Abraham by the freewoman.

Ga 6:12-13	He shows what they intend that preach circumcision.
Ga 6:14-18	He glories in nothing, save in the cross of Christ.
