The Orthodox Creed General Baptists, 1679

Editor's Preface

The seventeenth century in England was fraught with a plethora of political and

religious problems. With the rise and fall of Oliver Cromwell's protectorate, and the
subsequent institution of many acts from Parliament that attacked those who would not
conform to the Church of England, Dissenters, especially Baptists, found themselves in a
very precarious situation. In an effort to show agreement with other Protestants,
especially with Presbyterians and Congregationalists, lengthy confessions were published
by both General and Particular Baptists. The most famous of these confessions, for the
Particular Baptists, is the Second London Confession of 1677, subsequently revised in
1689. The Second London Confession was modeled after the Westminster Confession in
hopes of presenting a unified Protestantism. However, the General Baptists also
attempted to model a confession after the Westminster Confession, and the result of that
attempt is The Orthodox Creed of 1679.

The Orthodox Creed was written, as stated in the "Advertisment to the Reader,"

for the counties of "Bucks, Hertford, Bedford, and Oxford;" however, it was never
adopted by the General Assembly, which is why it may not have enjoyed as wide a
popularity among General Baptists as the Second London Confession enjoyed among
Particular Baptists. The lack of adoption by the General Assembly does not diminish the
importance of this document, for it is a clear representation of the beliefs and practices of
the seventeenth-century General Baptists in England.

The BaptistTheology.org reproduction of The Orthodox Creed, for the first time
since it was originally published, includes the Preface, the Advertisement to the Reader,
containing the signatures, and the Postscript. These three pieces are integral for a correct
understanding of the document, for in them, especially the Preface, one sees the
underlying reasons for the following 50 articles. The Preface also makes clear the attempt
of these General Baptists to align themselves religiously and politically with other
"orthodox" Protestants seeking acceptance in the kingdom.

So why have these three pieces not been included before? The answer to that

question resides with the publishing of Thomas Crosby's History of the English Baptists
in 1738-1740. It is in volume 3 of Crosby's seminal history that The Orthodox Creed was
first reprinted.1 Moreover, it is from Crosby's work that all subsequent editions-
Underhill,2 McGlothlin,3 and Lumpkin,4 and George5-of the Creed have been copied.

The Orthodox Creed General Baptists, 1679

Crosby only included the 50 articles of the piece, and subsequent editors, relying
exclusively upon Crosby, also include only the articles. Adam Taylor, another early
Baptist historian, said that it is "lamentable" that Crosby would leave out the signatures
in his reproduction.6 Joseph Ivimey concurs with Taylor and further accuses Crosby,
because of his omissions, of, "attempting to amalgamate all the Baptists into one
denomination, and therefore he has endeavoured to prevent the General and the Particular
Baptists from being distinguished."7

The tradition of following Crosby's work as the authoritative version of the Creed

is more problematic than merely omitting the Preface and the other pieces. As Crosby
was adding this Creed to his volume, he took the liberty of reformatting it. Although he
did not change any of the words in the document, nevertheless his changes, however
miniscule, at times changed the meaning and left the document devoid of particular
emphases which the original authors included.

First, Crosby, in attempt to modernize the grammar, decided to reinterpret the

comma placement of the original. Article XX, "Of the Free-will in Man", for example,
speaks of the relationship between the first and second covenants. The original reads,
"according to the tenure of the new Covenant of Grace in Christ, though not perfectly
according to the tenure of the First Covenant." Crosby's rendering of this section is,
"according to the tenure of the new covenant of grace in Christ, tho' not perfectly,
according to the tenure of the first covenant." The difference between the two is small in
space, but important in impact, for the original has "perfectly" modifying "according,"
whereas, Crosby has "perfectly" modifying the entire clause. The difference in the
placement of the comma changes the meaning.

Note also Article XIX, "Of the agreement between the Old and New Testament".

The last line of this article has in the original the phrase, "and hold forth the self-same
Gospel-Salvation to them and us." There is one congruent thought, yet Crosby inserts a
comma between Gospel and Salvation creating a short pause and a break of thought. In
changing the usage of commas, as well as semi-colons, Crosby altered the construction of
thought the General Baptists originally included. Instances such as these are scattered
throughout Crosby's reproduction and, subsequently, all previous reproductions.

Second, the original document is replete with capitalized words that would not

normally be treated as proper nouns. Words like "man," "will," and "face" are
capitalized, as context demands, in the original manuscript. As one reads through the
confession, one sees that these capitalized words are the important ideas and main
subjects of the particular articles. Through capitalization, the General Baptists were
placing emphasis upon these ideas. Yet, Crosby chose to remove most of the
capitalization found in the original, and thus the theological import assigned by the
authors is lessened.

Crosby's version of The Orthodox Creed, as a whole, is an adequate reproduction

for introductory purposes. However, Crosby's revisions have not only changed certain
meanings for careful theological readers of his edition, but also for the readers of the
Underhill, McGlothlin, Lumpkin, and George editions. The version of the Creed
reproduced here has been transcribed from the original publication rather than the
editorial tradition. The punctuation, capitalization, and spelling have been transcribed as
published in the 1679 original, and the important front and back matter have been
included for the first time in a modern edition.

Judicious and Impartial

R... E R

Courteous Reader,

THE truly Ancient and Apostolical Faith, that1 was once delivered unto the
Saints, by our Lord Jesus Christ, and miraculously confirmed unto us, by Signs, and
Wonders, and divers Gifts of the Holy Ghost,2according to the good pleasure of Almighty
God. Which said Faith, and Practice, recorded in the holy Oracles of Truth, and
miraculously preserved from Age to Age, even in the darkest times of Popery, and
Apostacy, by the infinite Wisdom, Mercy, and Goodness of God, is yet remaining, and to
be continued3to the end of the World; and hath been manifested in all, or most
Nations4for the obedience of Faith; the which Preservations of the Sacred Scriptures, or
revelation of Gospel-Light therein contained, (of which this Nation hath had a grate
share, especially within this last Hundred Years) is5 undoubtedly a very great Evidence,
of the Divine Verity, and Authority of the same: And the End of God in revealing this
Light of the holy Scriptures, or Gospel of Christ, is that it might be read and known of all
men, and it's our duty6to believe it, and thereby come through Faith, not only to have a
saving, but a satisfactory knowledg of those foundation and fundamental Truths, which
have been the same in all Generations; have been and shall be transmitted7 more clear
from Age to Age in the times8of Reformation, until that which9 is Perfect is come, and
that which is Imperfect is done away; such addition is no Invocation, but Illustration; not
a new Light, but a new Sight: The Looking-Glass slurd and cleared more or less, is the
same Glass. Columbus did not make a new World, when he made a discovery of the Old.

Truth wants so much of its Glory, as it is unseen: The Understanding wants so

much of its perfection, as it is short in seeing thereof.

The Orthodox Creed General Baptists, 1679

And all Unbelief is Presumption, not Faith, which hinders Nourishment, and

genders Humours.

Grace and Glory hold proportion with the Truth. Though Knowledge may be
without Grace, yet Grace is not without Knowledg, according to the measure of our
approach to an exact total and adequate union of the Understanding with the truth of the
Gospel; so us the glory of the Truth believed, and the communion of the Soul believing.
Now after some years profession of the Ancient way, and Truths of Christ,

evidenced by the holy Oracles in Scripture, we have in most cordial manner published
this little Manual, or Orthodox Confession of our Faith, to the consideration of all sober
Persons, and Religious, or well-meaning Protestants, that own the Authority and Verity
of the sacred Scriptures; and by comparing of this our Confession of Faith, with the
sacred Writ, we doubt not but they will then conclude, that those strange Conceptions,
hard Thoughts, and Persecuting Reflections cast upon us, and spoken of us, will be much
abated, if not wholly taken away, in all Sober Religious Protestants in England, or
elsewhere, differing from us. And to that end, in the Cloudy Day, we might arrive at a
more general Concord among our selves, in the main Points of the Protestant Religion,
and take off the false, and unjust Accusations of the Papists, and all other Enemies of the
Faith, once delivered to the Saints, by Christ and his Apostles, at least stop their Mouths,
or prevent the Simple, of being deluded by them, in their boasting of the unit of their
Pseudo, or Catachrestical Church.

As also their Discriminating the Protestants in England, and elsewhere, with the

name of Hereticks, and Schismaticks; and that they have no Agreement among
themselves. And the cause is (say they) because they have no true Faith, nor infallible
Judge to guide and direct them. Now that we may refute these Calumnies, and false
Charges of theirs against the English Protestants, we will give them, and all others, an
account of our Faith grounded upon God's holy Word, written in it by his Infallible
Spirit, which inspired his holy Prophets, and Apostles, to write them for our Rule, both in
Faith and Practice; and as for our Agreement in matters of Faith, there are but three
main Opinions among our Protestant Professors in England, and they are commonly
known by these three Names (viz.) Episcopalians, Presbyterians, or Independants, and
Anabaptists, (but rightly called Baptists). Now the difference between these may be much
in Ceremonies, or Circumstantial things, and in their Discipline, and Government of the
Church.

But as for their Faith in most, or all of the main Fundamentals of the Christian

Religion, they do agree; as may appear to ever Impartial Reader, that shall consider the
Thirty Nine Articles of the Church of England, and Mr. Beza's Confession of Faith. And
the Confession of Faith signed and published by the Assembly of Divines, and many
others by the Baptists in England.

Now if these several Confessions of Faith, be compared with this our Confession

now published, it will appear we have endeavoured to unite with other Protestants
aforesaid, in the main Fundamental Articles of the Christian Faith. Therefore not so
divided among our selves, as we are all represented to be by the slanderous Tongues of
the Papists. Nor are we in any Points of Religion, so much divided among our selves,10 as
the Roman Catholicks be in their Church, notwhithstanding their vain boasting of Unity.

10See Mr. Shelden's Book of Recantation.

And for other Noval Opinions in England, we have reason to believe that the

Roman Catholicks have had a great hand in helping forward and fomenting of them, yet
nevertheless by this our positive Creed, or Confession of Faith, it's most manifest to all
Orthodox Christians, that we have sufficiently bore Testimony against their false
Doctrines, as also against Atheism, Epicurism, the mad worshipping of Idols, and
multiplicity of Gods, which the blind Heathen worship; the Heresie of Manichaeus, who
held two beginnings of Good and Evil; and also the blasphemous Opinions of the
Anthropomorphites, who make God like unto Man11: Which impious Idolatrous Opinions
we do abominate and those wicked Opinions and Heresies, of the Macedonians,
Marcionites, Valentinians, Apelles, Apolinarians, Eunomians, Ebionites, Nestorians,
Eutychians; 12 who held that the Humane Nature after the Union was indued with the
properties of the Divinity, (viz.) The Divine Nature was turned into Flesh.

Manichees, Ubiquitarians, Socinians or Biddelians, Arians, Sabellians,
Samosatenus, Sevetus, Patripassions, Tritheites, Anti-trinitatrians, Anti-scripturians,
Quakers, who have gilded over old Heresies, and have them new Names, the better to
deceive; Seekers, or such that are above Ordinances. All which said Opinions and
Heresies, have been learnedly Confuted, by the Learned and Orthodox Pens of Dr.
Usher. Mr. Perkins, Dr. Owen, Dr. Hall, Mr. Tombs, Mr. Hicks, and Mr. Monck, in his
little Book entitled, A Cure for the Cankering Error of the New Eutychians, and many
other Orthodox Men, both Ancient and Modern, that have asserted the Truth in
opposition to these and such like abominable Hereticks, and Heresies, too large to be
inserted here. We have also in this our Confession of Faith, laboured to avoid the
dangerous Rocks of Pelagianism, Antinomianism, Arminianism, and the Remonstrants.
As also, ( as well as we may) we have endeavoured to avoid the extreams of the
Superlapsarians, and Sublapsarians, and others: Which said latter Opinions, we humbly
conceive, and judge in many things, are inconsistent with God's Revealed Will in
Scripture, especially that of irrespective Reprobation of particular Persons, before they
have done wither Good, or Evil.

But the Socinian Doctrine, and such like most dangerous Opinions, or Doctrines,
which raze at once the foundation of the Christian Religion, in that they do most plainly
deny, a Trinity in Unity, and Unity in Trinity; Three Persons, (viz. The Father, the Son,
and the Holy Ghost), and one God; and so by consequence, the only true object of Faith
and Worship. As also, their damnable opinions in denying Christ's satisfaction by his
Death, and Merits, to the Father's Justice for sinful Man; as also the imputation of the
Mediatoral Righteousness of Christ, to every true Believer in order to his Justification,
Christ having lived an holy Life, and perfectly kept or fulfilled the Law for us, without
which we could never have been saved. All which Opinions, and many more, in part or in
whole, we have bore our Testimony against in this our positive Creed, or Confession of
Faith. And thus it's plainly manifest to every Impartial Reader, that we have unfeignedly
from out Hearts, joined issue Concordably, with the Learned and Orthodox Pens of both
the Ancients, and Apostolick, fundamental Faith; and do oppugne, as well as they, to our
power, according to the Word of God, the whole Army, or Legion of Heresies, that have

turned into the Divinity.-So that by that Transubstantiation the Human Nature had no longer being. See Dr. Person, in

and do by subtil Instruments, incumber the Christian Religion. And let not any Persons,
or Congregations that are separated from the Romish Religion, or Church of Rome, and
yet notwithstanding hold some gross Heresie, repugnant to any of the Foundation
Articles of the Christian Faith, contained in Athanasius's, or the Apostles Creed (so
called) conclude that they are so much better than they, though differing from them in
other smaller matters. And let such Congregations, or Persons, that hold, maintain,
connive at or suffer these or such like Heresies, and Hereticks, (we have named, and by
our Articles have Opposed and Confuted) take heed lest such Doctrine do not in the end
unchurch them, especially if they do not defend, and contend for the Orthodox Faith, by
bearing a Testimony against such Hereticks, according to the Rule which St. Paul gives
the Churches, in Titus 3.10 to reform them.

And for any Persons to be so zealous as some seem, or pretend to be, in several
Congregations, of some Duty contained in the second Table, and to slight, or make little
Conscience of the Duties of the first Table, is very strange to Men of Conscience and
Reason (notwithstanding it is the practice of such, as pretend to be Masters of Reason):
for how can it be that such Persons can be good Christians, or have true love to Christ,
that have Courage enough to speak, or act, when their own Persons, Estates, to
Relations, are persecuted, or oppressed, or when some13 Statute-Law of Christ is broken,
or misinterpreted (though this is well), and their Duty, (especially the latter), and yet
make no Conscience at all to oppose, or deal with them that do take away the King's14
Dignity, Power, and Crown of Glory, or Blaspheme him by their Erroneous Opinions, or
Heresies?15 And yet these must be suffered, and connived at in Congregations, which we
are sure, neither consisteth with Scripture,16 or Right Reason but is indeed the proper
effects of ignorance in God's Laws, as also Self-interest, and Hypocritical Partiality, or
Covetous Impiety. In a word, if such Persons repent not, nor Congregations reform not,
by purging out such Cankering Heresies, or Hereticks, we must conclude from God's
Word, Right Reason, and Common Experience, that such things are the sad Prodroms17
of some sore and dismal Cloud of Judgments, that may sooner, or later, more, or less,
(we have too much cause to fear) fall upon such Congregations, if they repent not.

And for such Persons, that through Pride, or Vain-Glory, do pretend to

Singularity; in finding out new Doctrines, or Opinions, and in their Preachings, or
Writings, charge the Orthodox with Plagiarism, because they speak the same Truths,
Doctrine, or Principles, that the Orthodox Christians have taught, written, and delivered
to us from Age to Age, according to the Analogie of Faith recorded in holy Scripture; let
such glory still in this their Singularity. For our parts we do profess, and ingenuously
declare to all the World, that we are far off from assuming such Singularity; but rather
have studied such Singularity; but rather have studied a Concord, or Unity, with our
Fore-Fathers, in the good Old Way of the Gospel; and have laboured to speak in the very
same Words, or Languages of Canaan, that our Fore-Fathers, the Godly Saints spoke in;
and do desire to walk in the Ancient Footsteps of the Flock of Christ, firmly believing in
the same Gospel-Covenant, and Mediator, that Noah, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and

of God.

the holy Apostles, &c. believed in, and were saved by, through Faith in Christ, there
being no alteration of the Covenant of Grace (as we know of), neither Objectively, nor
Subjectively, it being one and the same in Substance, from the Fall of Adam, to this Day.
And so the Old and New Testaments, like the Faces of the Cherubims, look one towards
another holding forth one Mediator,18 and Way of Salvation by him, though revealed to
us by sundry degrees, and in divers manners.

And if any Matter, we have now published, in these Fifty Articles, shall seem
Noval, or Singular to any, being soberly weighed, and impartially considered by the
Reader, it will appear, it is more by way of Explanation, and Accommodation, in order to
a Union, than any new Matter, or Words: All the Articles being delivered in a plain and
modest style, and in Scripture Language, fitted to the meanest Capacities, we not
pretending to any Rhetorical, or Humane Eloquence in speaking, no farther forth than it
serves to express the truth Intelligibly to others. For Reason it self, as well as Tongues, or
Humane Learning, ought to be subservient to the Mind of the Holy Ghost, or Divine
Mysteries of Faith, revealed in Scripture; for we believe it, ex authoritate dicentis, relying
upon the Truth of him that saith it, and not upon Reason: And all the Evidence which we
get by Reason, is nothing to this Certitude. For if Reason should go before, like an Usher
to make way to Faith in Divine Mysteries, we should never believe. In many Divine
Truths, the Schoolmen say well, Rationes praecedentes minuunt fidem, sed Rationes
subsequentes augent sidem: Reasons going before Faith weaken Faith, but Reasons
coming after Faith strengthen it.

For Philosophy it self, though maintained by the successive force of the greatest
Wits, yet is purblind, or dark-sighted, in Divine Mysteries, and evaporates into nothing,
before Divine Revelation: but Christianity, attended by its own Authority, established its
Dominion,19 and raised an eternal Empire of Truth and Holiness in the World; yet the
Reason of Man cannot inspire into its own predictions, or principle of Life: for the
Conversion of Men and Women to Christianity, was, and is, the effect of infinite Mercy,
and equal Power; and the Simple, Plain, and Divine Truths of Jesus Christ in the Gospel;
shall survive its uttermost Periods, maugre all its Enemies, and greatest Opposition;
although it be in a showre of Blood, yet it shall thereby be made Fruitful: According to
that true axiom, that the Blood of the Martyrs, is the seed of the Church. And by its
everlasting Monuments, remain for ever, by its victorious permanent Efficacy. And
though the Way of the Gospel be attended (especially the powerful profession of it) with
some difficulty, yet remember what St. Chrysostom saith,20 Non aspicias aspera est via,
sed attende quo ducit, nec considera quod est arcta, sed ubi definit: Regard thou not that
the way to Life is streight, but mark whither it leadeth, and where it endeth. Nemo potest
hic gaudere cum seculo, illic regnare cum Deo.21-No Man can have his full contentment
and delight, both in this, and God's Kingdom. Consider Souls,22 God's Tabernacle is in
Salem, and his Dwelling-place is in Sion: How then shall we esteem of the Truth,23 and
Worship of God? and desire to meet him where he hath promised his Presence, setting a
low esteem of the Glory, and Grandure of this World, in its greatest Riches. Consider all

true, and lasting Felicity, and Riches, are in Christ; and as St. Bernard saith,24 O Lord
Jesus, he that will not live to Thee, is worthy of Death, and is already Dead; and he that is
not Wise to Thee, is become a Fool; he that desireth any Being but for Thee, is to be
esteemed as nothing, &c. Oh consider what Christ hath done for us! As St. Augustine
hath it,25 Oh Son of God! how great was thy humility! How great was thy Charity! How
exceeding was thy Pity! I sinned, thou are Chastised; I offended, thou are Punished; I was
disobedient, thou Obedient for me; I transgressed, and thou are Tortured, &c. Hearken to
the Word of God as St. Ambrose adviseth us,26-Interrogentur Scripturae, &c. that is,
Consult with the Scripture, the Apostles, the Prophets, what they spake, Christ speaketh.
But if it be said, the Scriptures be hard to be understood: Consider what St.

Augustine hath said in answer to such an Objection.27 Magnifice, & salubriter Spiritus
Sanctus Scripturas ita occurreret, obscurioribus autem fastidia detergeret, nihil fere de
illis obscurioribus eruit, quod non planissime alibi dictum reperiatur.

The Holy Ghost hath therefore magnificently and wholsomely so tempered the

Scriptures that by plain, and easie places, he might prevent Famine: By obscure places,
he might wipe away all Loathsomness (or Disdain): For nothing almost, is gathered out
of those obscure places, which is not in some other places delivered plainly.

And this Authority of the Word of God, its an Honour upon the Ministry thereof,

that we should honour them, and hearken to them, when they come in the Name of Christ;
for Christ saith, Qui vos audit, me audit: He that heareth you, heareth me. Therefore let
such that make no conscience of disdaining, and reflecting calumniously upon the sober
godless Ministers, or Servants of Christ, forbear such practice; for God saith, Touch not
mine anointed, and do my Prophets no harm; and the dust of their Feet, will be a witness
against such Persons (if they do not repent) in the Day of Judgment.

Finally, Consider Immortal Souls! This place you are now in, is not Terra

viventium, the Land of the Living, which maketh us blessed, and which the Meek shall
inherit: But terra morientium, the Land of the Dying, wherein we dwell as Strangers and
Pilgrims, for a short time: And as the Vail of the Temple before it was rent, did hinder is
from the sight of the Cherubims, and Mercy seat: So must our Corruptions be rent from
us, which hinder us from the beatifical sight of Christ, our Saviour. Sed si recte Deum
amenius. But if we truly love God the Father, and Jesus Christ and his Kingdom, (this
love will symbolize our Minds, into that which we love; for the Mind is not where it
liveth, but where it loveth). An endeavour so to live in this World, that short time to have
to live among the Wicked, and slanderous backbiting Tongues, and tempestuous proud
Waves, and dangerous Rocks of Heresie, and ungodly Professors; who glory more in
their formal name of a Christian, or Professor, than they care, or endeavour to live in the
power of it; that being too straight a way, or too heavy a burden for many now a-days.
Yet the Godly should be as Lillies themselves, Quae in sas utique pungentes se spinas
candors proprio illustrare non cessant: Which in their own Beauty do adorn the Thorns
themselves, by whom they are pricked. And though their proud Waves beat upon thee,
and though be as Thorns to thee, yet ne tibuletur Cardes tuum,28 let not thy Heart be
troubled; for this Jesus Christ is Musick in the Ear, Pleasure and Comfort in the Heart.

So that from your experience of God's Grace, thou wilt say with the Psalmist,29 O how
amiable are thy Dwellings, O Lord of Hosts? My Heart and my Flesh shall rest in the
Living God.

Consider these things, Christian Reader, which are here humbly proposed, to that

end the Protestant Interest might be united in the love of, and practice, and power of
Godliness, in Church and Family; and Heresie oppugned, and Hereticks detected, Schism
prevented, and Scandals removed, were undeserved and humble Souls comforted, and all
good Christians in the unity of the true Faith, established according to God's Word; and
Christian Congregations reformed, and Obedience to Superiours (in all lawful things)
performed. These, and such like, being the Main Ends of our publishing this Confession
of Faith at this time: Therefore if any shall Censure it, we only beg this favour, That first
they will be pleased to weigh and consider, whose things herein proposed, in the balance
of the Sanctuary, according to our Saviour's Rule,30 to Search the Scripture, &c. And like
the31 noble Bereans, to search and see whether these things be so or no, and after that to
judge. And as St. Paul saith,32 To prove all things, and hold fast that which is good; and
contend earnestly for the Faith that was once delivered to the Saints. And if thou findest
any Profit, or Advantage to thy Soul, give God the Glory, and help us by thy Prayers, and
we have our End. Vale.

Orthodox Creed.

I. Article.

Of the Essence of God.

 WE verily believe, that there is but one,1 only Living2 and true God;3 whose
Subsistence is in and of Himself;4 whose Essence cannot be comprehended5 by any but
Himself; a most Pure, Spiritual,6 or Invisible Substance:7 who hath an Absolute,
Independent, Unchangeable, and Infinite Being; without Matter or Form, Body, Parts, or
Passions.8

For I am the Lord, I change not, Mal. 3.6. God is a Spirit, John 4.24. Now unto

the King Eternal, Immortal, Invisible, the only Wise God, be Honour and Glory, for ever
and ever, Amen. I Tim. 1.17. Ye heard a Voice, but saw no Similitude, Deut. 14.12.

Of the Divine Attributes in God.

EVery particle of being in Heaven and Earth, leads us to the Infinite Being of
beings, (namely God) who is Simplicity, (viz.) one meer and perfect Act, without all
Composition,9 and an Immense Sea of Perfections; who is the only Eternal Being,
everlasting without Time,10 whose Immense Presence, is always every where present;11
having Immutability without any alteration12 in Being, or Will,13 (In a word) God is

Infinite, of universal, unlimited, and Incomprehensible Perfection, most Holy,14 Wise,
Just,15 and Good; whose Wisdom is his Justice, whose Justice is his Holiness, and whose
Wisdom, Justice, and Holiness, is Himself.16 Most Merciful, Gracious, Faithful and True,
a full Fountain of Love, and who is that Perfect, Sovereign, Divine Will, the Alpha of
Supreme Being.17

Is it true, indeed, that God will dwell on the Earth? Behold, the Heaven, and
Heaven of Heavens cannot contain Thee: How much less this House which I have built, I
Kings 8.27. Great is the Lord, and worthy to be praised, and his Greatness is
Incomprehensible. Psal. 145.3.

III. Article

Of the Holy Trinity.

IN this divine, and infinite being, or Unity of the Godhead, there are three
Persons, or Subsistences,18 the Father,19 the Word, or Son,20 and the Holy Spirit,21 of one
Substance,22 Power,23 Eternity,24 and Will;25 each having the whole Divine Essence, yet
the Essence undivided.26 The Father is of none, neither Begotten nor Proceeding; the Son
is Eternally Begotten of the Father; the Holy Ghost is of the Father, and the Son,
proceeding.27 All Infinite, without Beginning, therefore but one God, who is Indivisible,
and not to be divided in Nature, or Being, but distinguished by several Properties and
Personal Relations; and we worship and adore a Trinity in Unity; and a Unity in Trinity,
three Persons, and but one God; which Doctrine of the Trinity, is the foundation of all our
Communion with God,28 and comfortable Dependence on him.

And there are three that bare Record in Heaven, the Father, the Word, and the

Holy Spirit, and these three are one, I John 5.7. Baptizing them in the Name of the
Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, &c. Mat. 28.19.

IV. Article

Of the Divine Nature, or Godhead of Christ.

 WE confess and believe, that the Son of God, or the Eternal Word, is very and
true God,29 having his Personal Subsistence of the Father alone,30 and yet for ever of
himself as God, and of the Father as the Son, the Eternal Son of an eternal Father; not
later in Beginning.31 There was never any time when he was not,32 not less in Dignity,
not other in Substance,33 Begotten without diminution of his Father that begat, of one
Nature and Substance with the Father; Begotten of the Father, while the Father
communicated wholly to the Son, which He retained wholly in himself, because both
were Infinite;34 without inequality of Nature, without division of Essence, neither Made,
nor Created, not Adopted, but Begotten before all Time;35 not a Metaphorical, or
subordinate God;36 not a God by Office, but a God by Nature, Coequal,37 Coessential,38
and Coeternal, with the Father, 39 and the Holy Ghost.

Jesus said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, before Abraham was, I am,
John 8.58. Jesus Christ the same yesterday, and to day, and for ever, Heb. 13.8. David
therefore calleth him Lord, how is he then his son? Luke 20.44.

V. Article.

Of the Second Person in the Holy Trinity, taking our Flesh.

 WE believe that the only Begotten Son of God, the Second Person in the Sacred
Trinity,40 took to himself a true, real, and fleshly Body,41 and reasonable Soul,42 being
Conceived in the fullness of Time,43 by the Holy Ghost,44 and Born of the Virgin Mary,45
and become very and true Man, like unto us in all things, even in our Infirmities, Sin only
excepted;46 as appeareth by his Conception, Birth, Life,47 and Death. He was of a

Woman,48 and by the Power of the Holy Ghost, in a Supernatural and Miraculous
manner, was Formed of the only Seed, or Substance of the Virgin Mary, in which respect
he hath the Name of the Son of Man,49 and is the true Son of David, the Fruit of the
Virgins Womb,50 to that end he might die for Adam.

VI. Article.

Of the Union of the two Natures in Christ.

 WE believe the Person of the Son of God, being a Person from all Eternity
existing, did assume the most pure Nature of Man,51 (wanting all Personal Existing of its
own)52 into the Unity of his Person, or Godhead,53 and made it his own; the properties of
each Nature being preserved, and this Inseparable and Indissolvable union of both
Natures, and was made by the Holy Ghost, Sanctifying our Nature in the Virgins
Womb,54 without change of either Nature, or mixture of both;55 and of two Natures is one
Christ, God-Man, or Immanuel, God with us.56 Which Mystery exceeds the Conception
of Men, and is the wonder of Angels, one only Mediator, Jesus Christ, the Son of God.57

VII. Article.

Of the Communication of Properties.

 WE believe that the two Natures in Christ, continue still distinct in Substance,
Properties, and Actions,58 and remain one and the same Christ:59 for the Properties of the
Godhead, cannot agree to the Properties of the Manhood, nor the Properties of the
Manhood, to the Properties of the Godhead. For as the Godhead, or Divine Nature cannot
Thirst, or be Hungry, no more can the Manhood be in all, or many places at once.
Therefore, we believe the Godhead was neither turned nor transfused into the Manhood,
not the Manhood into the Godhead, but both; the Divine Nature keepeth entire all his
Essential Properties to it self, so that the Humanity is neither Omnipotent, Omniscient,
nor Omnipresent: And the Humane also keepeth his Properties, though often that which is
proper to the one Nature, is spoken of the Person denominated from the other,60 which

must be understood by the Figure Senecdoche, (viz.) A part being taken for the whole, by
reason of the Union of both Natures into one Person.

Hereby perceive we the love of God, because he laid down his Life for us, I John

3.16.

VIII. Article.

Of the Holy Spirit.

 WE believe that there is one holy Spirit, the Third Person subsisting in the
Sacred Trinity;61 one with the Father and Son, who is very and true God; of one
Substance or Nature, with the Father and Son,62 Coequal, Coessential, and Coeternal
with the Father and Son, to whom with the Father and Son, Three Persons, and but one
Eternal and Almighty God,63 be by all the Hosts of Saints and Angels, ascribed Eternal
Glory and Hallelujahs. Amen.

IX. Article.

Of Predestination and Election.

THe decrees of God are founded on Infinite Wisdom, and situate in Eternity,64
and are Crowned with Infallibility as to the Event.65 Now predestination unto Life, is the
everlasting Purpose of God:66 whereby the Foundation of the World was laid, he hath
constantly Decreed in his Counsel secret to us,67 to deliver from Curse and Damnation,
those whom he hath chosen in Christ,68 and bring them to everlasting Salvation, as
Vessels made to Honour,69 through Jesus Christ, whom he Elected before the Foundation
of the World,70 and is called God's Elect, in whom his Soul delighteth;71 being the Lamb
fore-ordained,72 and so Predestined unto the Superlative Glory of the Hypostatical
Union.73 And this not for any foreseen Holiness in his Humane Nature (sith all that did
flow out of the Hypostatical Union) being Elected of meer Grace, as are all the Members
of his Mystical Body.74 And God the Father gave this his Elected and Beloved Son, for a
Covenant to the People, and said, That his Covenant shall stand fast with him; and his

seed shall endure for ever.75 And albeit God the Father be the Efficient Cause of all good
Things he intended to us,76 yet Christ is the Meriting Cause of all those good Things God
intended to us in Election, (viz.) Repentance, Faith and sincere Obedience to all God's
Commandments.77 And so God the Father, that He might bring about the Eternal
Salvation of his Elect, chose the Man Christ, with respect to his Humane Nature, out of
the fallen lump of Mankind,78 which in the fullness of Time, he made of a Woman, made
under the Law, to redeem those that were under it;79 that we might receive the Adoption
of Sons.80 And though Christ came from Adam, as Eve did,81 yet not by Adam as Cain
did,82 viz. by natural Propagation. Therefore without any stain of Sin,83 and this second
Adam, being by God's Eternal Decree, excepted out of the first Covenant, as being
neither God the Father, who was justly offended; not yet sinful Adam, who had offended
him in breaking of it.-- Therefore Christ the Second Adam was a fit Mediator between
God and Man, to reconcile both in himself,84 by the shedding and sprinkling of his
Blood, according to God's Eternal Purpose in Electing of Christ, and of all that do, or
shall believe in him; which Eternal Election, or Covenant-Transaction between the Father
and Son,85 is very consistent with his revealed Will, in the Gospel.86 For we ought not to
oppose the Grace of God in Electing of us, nor yet the Grace of the Son in Dying for all
Men (and so for us); nor yet the Grace of the Holy Ghost in propounding the Gospel, and
persuading us to believe it:87 For until we do believe, the effects of God's displeasure are
not taken from us; for the Wrath of God abideth on all them that do not believe in
Christ;88 for the actual declaration in the Court of Conscience, is by Faith as an
Instrument,89 (not for Faith as a Meriting Cause): for Christ is the Meriting Cause of
eternal Life to all that believe, but not of God's Will to give eternal Life to them, nor yet
of God's Decree to save us,90 albeit we are chosen in Christ before the Foundation of the
World. Now Faith is necessary as the way of our Salvation, as an Instrumental Cause:91
but the Active and Passive Obedience of Christ, is necessary as a Meriting Cause of our
Salvation;92 therefore God's Eternal Decree doth not oppose his revealed Will in the
Gospel,93 it being but one, not two diverse or contrary Wills. For his decree as King,
decreeth the Event, or what shall be done infallibly; but his command as a Lawgiver,94
sheweth not what shall be done, but what is the duty of man to do, and leave undone:

Therefore God hath (we believe) decreed, that Faith as the means, and Salvation as the
end, shall be joyned together, that where one is, the other must be also:95 for it is written,
He that believeth, shall be saved.96 Also, Believe in the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt
be saved.97 Now here is a great Mystery indeed, for God so administereth his absolute
Decree, that he leaveth us much place for an Efficacious Conditional-Dispensation,98 as
if the Decree it self were conditional.

X. Article.

Of Preterition, or Reprobation.

 WE do believe, that known unto God are all his Works from Eternity.99
Therefore he foresaw Adam's fall, but did not decree it, yet foreseeing it in his eternal
Counsel and Wisdom, did Elect and chuse Jesus Christ, and all that do or shall believe in
him, out of that fallen Lump of Mankind.
 And hath manifested his Love and
Grace by Jesus Christ, (his Elect, or beloved Son) through the Gospel means, to all; and
hath given us his Word and Oath, to assure us that he desires not the death of the Wicked,
but rather that they repent, or return to him and live;100 and if any do perish, their
destruction is of themselves.101 And hath decreed to punish all those wicked, or ungodly,
disobedient, and unbelieving or impenitent Sinners,102 that have, or shall despise his
Grace, Love, and Woings, or Strivings, of the Holy Ghost,103 or Long-suffering, whether
by a total and continued rejection of Grace, or by an universal and final Apostacy; and
such Persons so living and dying, shall be punished with everlasting destruction in Hell-
fire,104 with the fallen Angels, or Devils, and shall be fixed in an irrecoverable state of
Damnation irrevocable, under the Wrath of God, they being the proper Objects of it; and
shall remain under his inexpressible Wrath and Justice, in unconceivable Torment, Soul
and Body, to all Eternity.105

fulfil it;113 yet mutable, or under a possibility of Transgressing,114 being left to the liberty
of their own Will, which was subject to change; and also gave them command not to eat
of the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil;115 and while they kept this Command, they
enjoyed most happy Communion with God, and had Dominion over the Creatures: And
all this wonderful Work of Creation, both in Heaven and in Earth, was finished in the
space of Six Days,116 and all very good.117 And although Reason cannot conceive nor

And on the other part, Man promised to perform entire and perfect Obedience to all
God's holy Commands in that Covenant, by that strength wherewith God endowed him in
his first Creation: by the improvement of which, he might have attained unto Eternal Life
without Faith, in the Blood of the Mediator of the New Covenant of Grace; but he sinning
against this Covenant, (which consisted in two Roots, (viz.) To love God above all things;
And his Neighbour as himself;124 it being the substance of that Law which was afterwards
written in two Tables of Stone, and delivered unto Moses upon Mount Sinai) and fell
under the just Sentence of Eternal Death,125 which was the punishment that God had
appointed for the breach of it. And under this Righteous Judgment of God, Adam and his
Natural Posterity, had for ever remained, as the fallen Angels do, had not God of his
infinite Grace and Love, provided his Son, to take unto himself our Nature, and so
became a fit Mediator between God the Father who was offended, and Man who had
offended him126 in breaking his holy Law and Covenant.

Of the Fall of Man, of his Sin, and of the Punishment thereof.

THe First Man Adam, in eating voluntarily of the forbidden Fruit, incurred the

Curse of God upon himself,127 and all, his Posterity (that came of him by Natural
Propagation) viz. Corporal and Spiritual Death, in Body and Soul eternally;128 but this
Covenant was not only made with him, but with his Seed also, which should descend
from his Loins by Natural Generation; he standing as a publick Person129 in the stead of
all Mankind. And as St. Paul saith, By him came sin, and death by sin, &c (Rom. 5.14.)
and so deprived himself and all his Posterity, of that Original Righteousness, which
God130 created him in.

Of Original (or Birth) Sin.

ORiginal Sin, is the fault and corruption of the Nature of every Man,131 that
naturally descendeth from Adam by natural Generation; by means of which, Man has not
only lost that Original Righteousness, that God created him in, but is naturally inclined to
all manner of evil, being conceived in Sin, and brought forth in Iniquity;132 and (as St.

Paul saith) The flesh lusteth against the spirit.133 And therefore every Man justly
deserveth God's Wrath and Damnation.134 And this Concupisence, or indwelling Lust,
remaineth even in the Regenerate, that they cannot love; nor obey God perfectly in this
Life, according to the tenour of the First Covenant.135

XVI. Article.

Of the New Covenant of Grace.

THe first Covenant being broken by Man's Disobedience, and by his Sin, he was
excluded from the Favour of God, and Eternal Life; in which deplorable condition of his,
God being pleased out of his Free-Grace, and Love to faln Man,136 (in order to his
recovery out of this sinful and deplorable Estate) hath freely offered him a Second, or a
New Covenant of Grace,137 (which New Covenant of Grace is Jesus Christ) in remission
of Sins, through Faith in his Blood,138 which God hath promised to give to all them that
do obey and submit to the conditions of this Covenant,139 which Covenant of Grace, and
Eternal Salvation annexed to it, is freely and fully offered unto all Men, upon the terms of
the Gospel, viz. Repentance, and Faith: And the Benefits of this Covenant, by God's
Free-Grace, through the Redemption that is in Jesus Christ, whom God has set forth to be
a Propitiation through Faith in his Blood,140 to declare his Righteousness for the
Remission of sins that are past through the forbearance of God, that he might be Just, and
the Justifier of him that believeth in Jesus. Therefore we conclude, that a Man is Justified
by Faith, without the deeds of the Law:141 for by Faith we receive that Righteousness that
the Law, or the First Covenant, required of the first Adam; which Righteousness Christ
hath fulfilled (in our Nature which he took of the Virgin Mary) by his Active
Obedience,142 and is by God's free Donation, made over to us by Imputation,143 for he
hath made him to us Wisdom, Righteousness, and Sanctification:144 For as by one Man's
Disobedience, many were made Sinners, so by the Obedience of one (that is Christ) shall
many be made Righteous. For Christ hath not only fulfilled the Sanction of the Law,
(viz.) to love God with all his Heart, and his Neighbour as himself, but hath also
voluntarily suffered the Curse of the Law, being made a Curse for us;145 that we might
receive the Blessing of Abraham, and the Promise of the Spirit through Faith, in his
Blood.146 And now, albeit the Essential Righteousness of Christ, as he is God equal with

Man (only), yet we believe his Mediatorial Righteousness, as God-Man;147 is imputed,
reckoned, or made over to us,148 upon the terms of this New-Covenant of Grace;149 and
so being justified by his Grace, we are thereby made Heirs according to the hope of
Eternal Life:150 For (as St. Paul saith) if Righteousness come by the Law, then Christ is
dead in vain, Gal. 2. ult.

Of Christ and his Mediatorial Office.

IT pleased God, in his Eternal Purpose, to chuse, and ordain the Lord Jesus
Christ, his only begotten Son, according to the Covenant made between them both,151 to
be the alone Mediator between God and Man,152 (viz.) God the Father, who was by
Adam's sin justly offended, and Adam (our common Parent) the person offending. Now
in order to reconcile God to Man, and Man to God, who were at a distance, Christ Jesus,
the Second Person in the Trinity, being very God, of the same Substance with his Father,
did, when the fulness of Time was come, take unto him Man's Nature, with all the
Essential Properties, and common Infirmities, (Sin only excepted) being made of a
Woman, of the Seed of Abraham,153 and David:154 And although he came from Adam,
and had truly the Nature of Man, (yet not by Adam); and the Person of Christ, took our
Nature into union with the Divine Nature, but he did not take the Person of Adam which
sinned;155 therefore we believe he was neither the Covenantee, nor yet the Covenanter,
and so by consequence, neither the Creditor, nor the Debtor. And being concerned by this
Office or Appointment of the Father to make Peace,156 it plainly appears, that he is the
only fit Mediator between God and Man,157 who is very God, and very Man; yet one
Christ; who was Sanctified, and Anointed with the Holy Spirit above measure,158 and was
Superlatively, and Admirably fitted for, and called unto this Office by his Father,159 who
put all judgment into his Hand, and Power to execute the same, and he willingly
undertook the same; and being made under the Law, did perfectly fulfill or keep it,160 and
underwent the Punishment due to us, which we should have suffered, our sin, and the
punishment of it being reckoned, or imputed to him;161 he being made a Curse for us,162

and underwent and trod the Wine-press of his Father's Wrath for us, in dolorous pangs
and agony of Soul, and painful sufferings in his Body,163 was Crucified, Dead, and
Buried, or remained in the state of the Dead, yet saw no Corruption,164 and on the Third
Day he arose from the Dead,165 with the same Body in which he suffered;166 with which
he also Ascended, and there sitteth at the Right Hand of his Father, making Intercession
for his Saints;167 and shall return to judg Men and Angels,168 at the end of the World:
And the same Lord Jesus, by his perfect Obedience to the whole Law, and Sacrifice of
himself, which he through the Eternal Spirit offered up unto God the Father,169 hath fully
satisfied the Justice of God, and reconciled him to us; and hath purchased an everlasting
Inheritance in the Kingdom of Heaven,170 for all those that the Father hath given unto
him;171 and now by a continued Act of Intercession in Heaven, doth apply the Benefits he
hath purchased unto the Elect.172 And in this Office of Mediator, he hath the Dignity of
Three Offices, (viz.) Priest,173 Prophet, 174and King:175 all which Offices are necessary for
the benefit of his Church, and without which we can never be saved.176 For in respect of
our Ignorance, we stand in need of his Prophetical Office, and in respect of our
Alienation from God, and imperfect Services, and God's Wrath and Justice, we stand in
need of his Priestly Office, to reconcile God to us, and us to God; and in respect of our
bondage to Sin and Satan, and averseness to return to God, we need his Kingly Office, to
subdue our Enemies; and deliver us Captives out of the kingdom and power of Sin, and
preserve us to his Heavenly Kingdom.177 And thus (in our Nature) he living the life of the
Law, and suffering the penalty due to us, continually presents us at the Throne of
Grace,178 so is a most wonderful and compleat Mediator for his Elect.

Of Christ Dying for all Mankind.

GOd the Father, out of his Royal Bounty, and Fountain of Love, when all
Mankind was fallen by Sin, in breaking of the first Covenant of Works made with them
in Adam, did chuse Jesus Christ, and sent him into the World to die for Adam, or fallen
Man. And God's love is manifest to all Mankind, in that he is not willing, as himself hath

Sworn, and abundantly declared in his Word, that Mankind should perish eternally,179 but
would have all to be Saved, and come to the knowledge of the Truth: And Christ died for
all Men, and there is a sufficiency in his Death and Merits for the Sins of the whole
World,180 and hath appointed the Gospel to be preached unto all;181 and hath sent forth
his Spirit to accompany the Word, in order to beget Repentance and Faith:182 So that if
any do Perish, it's not for want of the means of Grace manifested by Christ to them, but
for the non-improvement of the Grace of God, offered freely to them through Christ in
the Gospel.183

XIX. Article.

Of the Agreement between the Old and New Testament.

THe Gospel, or New Covenant, was held forth, or preached to the Fathers, from
Adam to Christ's coming in the Flesh,184 though it was revealed by sundry Degrees, and
in diverse Manners,185 in Types and Shadows, darkly;186 yet it was the same Gospel, the
same Christ, the same Faith (for kind), and the very same Covenant, that they were
justified and saved by, before Christ took Flesh of the Virgin, that we have now, and is to
continue to the end of the World.187 For as the Church of the Jews in their Gospel Types,
had a Priest, and an Altar, and a Lamb, and a Fire, and without all these no Sacrifice
could, or was accepted of God, then nor now, without Faith in the Antitype Christ, whose
Humane Nature is the true Lamb, the Union of Natures, the High Priest, the Divine
Nature, the Altar, and the Holy Ghost, the Heavenly Fire.188 And again, the Blood shed
upon the Brazen Altar, may be applied to our Justification, and the sprinkling of it upon
the Incense Altar, may be applied to the Work of Sanctification by Christ's189 Spirit,
sprinkling his Blood upon us.190 And the Blood that was carried within the Vail, into the
most Holy Place, is applied to our Glorification in Heaven.191 And as they had in their
Church the Ark, a figure of Christ's Presence; so have we the Promise of his Presence to
the end of the World.192 And as they had the Tables of the Old Covenant, or Law, in the
Ark; so have we the Law fulfilled by Christ;193 and meeting God in Christ, it's handed
forth by Christ now to us,194 as the only rule of our Sanctification, and Obedience,
through his Grace. And as they had the Manna to nourish them in the Wilderness to

condition, till we come to Heaven. And as they had the Rod that Corrected them; so have
we the Church-Censures now to Correct us,195 when we offend his Law. And their Burnt-
offering may be applied to Christ, killing of Original Sin in us, and their Sin-offering may
be applied to Christ killing, or taking away our Actual Sins; and their Peace-offering may
be applied to our Reconciliation with God in Christ by his Spirit; and so all the rest of
those Gospel-Antitypes may be applied. And thus the Old and New Testaments, like the
Faces of the Cherubims, look one toward another, and hold forth the self-same Gospel-
Salvation to them and us.

Of Free-will in Man.

GOd hath endued the Will of Man with that natural liberty and power, of acting
upon Choice, that it is neither forced, nor by any necessity of Nature determined, to do
Good or Evil:196 But Man in the state of Innocency, had such power and liberty of Will,
to chuse and perform that which was acceptable and well pleasing to God, according to
the requirement of the First Covenant;197 but he falling from his state of Innocency,
wholly lost all ability, or liberty of Will, to any Spiritual Good, for his eternal
Salvation,198 his Will being now in bondage under Sin and Satan;199 and therefore not
able of his own strength to Convert himself, nor prepare himself thereunto, without God's
Grace taketh away the enmity out of his Will, and by his special Grace, freeth him from
his natural Bondage under Sin, enabling him to will freely and sincerely, that which is
spiritually good,200 according to the tenure of the new Covenant of Grace in Christ,
though not perfectly according to the tenure of the First Covenant;201 which perfection of
Will is only attainable in the state of Glory, after the Redemption, or Resurrection of our
Fleshly Bodies, Rom. 8.23. Ephes. 4.13.

time worketh unfained Faith, and sincere Repentance in them;205 and by his Grace they

becomes their Father in Christ, and they being then effectually called,206 are by Faith
united to Jesus Christ by Grace unto Salvation.207

Of Angelical Repentance.

UNfained Repentance, is an inward and true sorrow of heart for Sin,208 with
sincere confession of the same to God, especially that we have offended so gracious a
God, and so loving a Father;209 together with a settled purpose of Heart, and a careful
endeavour to leave all our sins and to live a more holy and sanctified Life, according to
all God's Commands.210 Or it is a turning, or change of the whole Man to God, with
endeavour, through his Grace, to mortifie the indwelling Lust, or Corruptions,211 and
obtain a great reformation both in the outward and inward Man, according to the Will of
God; and this Repentance, for the nature of it, must be continued throughout the whole
course of our Lives,212 and is wrought in us by the Spirit of God, by the Ministry of the
Law and Gospel,213 in order to our obedience to Christ, or being Baptized in his Name,214
but this Repentance unto Life is not wrought without Faith in the Soul;215 for by Faith we
receive that Grace that perfects, or carrieth on the Work of Repentance in the Soul from
first to last.216

XXIV. Article.

Of Justification by Christ.

JUstification is a Declarative, or Judicial Sentence of God the Father,224 whereby
he of his infinite Love, and most free Grace, for the alone and Mediatorial Righteousness
of his own Son, performed in our Nature and stead; which Righteousness of God-Man,
the Father imputing to us,225 and by effectual Faith received and embraced by us,226 doth
free us by Judicial Sentence from Sin and Death, and accepts us Righteous in Christ our
Surety, unto Eternal Life;227 the Active and Passive Obedience of Christ being the
Accomplishment of all that Righteousness and Sufferings the Law, or Justice of God
required;228 and this being perfectly performed by our Mediator, in the very Nature of us
Men,229 and accepted by the Father in our stead,230 according to that eternal Covenant-
Transaction, between the Father and the Son.231 And hereby we have deliverance from
the Guilt and Punishment of all our Sins, and are accounted Righteous before God, at the
Throne of Grace, by the alone Righteousness of Christ the Mediator, imputed, or
reckoned unto us through Faith; for we believe there are six necessary Causes of Man's
Justification, or Salvation. (Viz.) First, The Efficient Cause of our Justification, is God's
free Grace.232 Secondly, The Meritorious Cause is the Blood of Christ.233 Thirdly, The
Material Cause is Christ's Active Obedience.234 Fourthly, The Imputation of Christ, his
Obedience for us, is the Formal Cause.235 Fifthly, The Instrumental Cause is faith.236
Sixthly, God's Glory, and Man's Salvation, is the final cause.237 Now we principally
apply the first and last to God the Father, the second and third to Christ the Mediator, the
fourth and fifth to the blessed Comforter, the Holy Ghost; hence it is we are Baptized in

are received into Favour, or brought near to God through Faith in Christ Jesus.239 And
Adoption is that power and privilege to be the Sons of God, through Faith in Christ our
Surety,240 who being the Eternal Son of God, became by Incarnation our Brother,241 that
by him God might bring many Sons unto Glory;242 according to his Eternal Decree of
preserving the Humane Nature of Christ, that it never fell in Adam.243 And so we are, by
Faith according to God's free Grace, and Christ's Purchase, or Redemption, and the Holy
Spirits application of it to us, made Heirs, and Joint-heirs with Christ our Elder
Brother,244 of the same Kingdom, and stupendous and unutterable Glory, for ever and
ever.

Of Sanctification, and good Works.

THose that are United unto Christ by Effectual Faith, are Regenerated, and have

a new Heart and Spirit created in them,245 through the virtue of Christ his Death,
Resurrection, and Intercession,246 and by the Efficacy of the Holy Spirit, received by
Faith;247 and are Sanctified by the Word and Spirit of Truth dwelling in them, by
destroying, or pulling down the strong Holds, or Dominion of Sin and Lust,248 and more
and more quickened and strengthened in all saving Graces, in the practice of Holiness;249
without which no Man shall see the Lord.250 And this Sanctification is throughout the

remnants of Corruption,251 which occasions a continual War in the Soul; the Flesh lusting
against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the Flesh. Yet through the continual supply of
strength from Christ, which flows from him to Believers by means of the Covenant of
Grace,252 or Hypostatical Union with our Nature, the Regenerate part doth overcome,
pressing after a Heavenly Life, in Evangelical obedience to all the Commands that Christ,
their King and Lawgiver, hath commanded them in his Word, or holy Scriptures,253
which are the only Rule, and square of our Sanctification and Obedience in all good
Works, and Piety. And sith our only assistance to good Works (such as God hath
commanded) is of God, who worketh in us both to will and to do,254 we have no cause to
boast, nor ground to conclude, we merit any thing thereby, we receiving all of free and
undeserved Grace, and when we have done the most, yet we are unprofitable Servants,
and do abundantly fall short; and the best duties that we can now perform, will not abide
the Judgment of God:255 Neither do any good Works whatsoever, that are done by
Unregenerate Men, or without Faith in, and Love to Christ, please God, or are accepted
of him.256 Yet good Works are of great advantage, being done in Faith, and Love, and
wrought by the Holy Spirit,257 and are to be done by us, to shew our thankfulness to God,
for the Grace of the New Covenant by Christ, and to fit us more and more for Glory:258
And in this sence, the Ten Commandments, as handed forth by Christ the Mediator, are a
Rule of Life to a Believer, and shew us our Duty to God and Man, as also our need of the
Grace of God, and Merit of Christ.

XXVIII. Article.

Of the right Subject and Administration of Holy Baptism.

BAptism is an Ordinance of the New Testament, ordained by Jesus Christ to be
unto the Party Baptized, or Dipped, a Sign of our entrance into the Covenant of Grace,
and ingrafting into Christ, and into the Body of Christ, which is his Church:261 And of
Remission of Sin in the Blood of Christ,262 and of our Fellowship with Christ, in his
Death and Resurrection, and of our living, or rising to newness of Life.263 And orderly
none ought to be admitted into the Visible Church of Christ, without being first264
Baptized;265 and those which do really profess Repentance towards God, and Faith in,
and obedience to our Lord Jesus Christ, are the only proper Subjects of this Ordinance,
according to our Lord's holy Institution, and Primitive Practice; and ought by the
Minister, or Administrator, to be done in a solemn manner, in the Name of the Father,
Son, and Holy Ghost,266 by Immersion or Dipping of the Person in the Element of
Water;267 this being necessary to the due Administration of this holy Sacrament, as holy
Scripture sheweth, and the first and best Antiquity witnesseth for some Centuries of
Years.268 But the Popish Doctrine which they teach and believe, that those Infants that die
without Baptism, or have it not actually, or in desire, are not, nor cannot be saved, we do
not believe. Nor yet their practice of admitting Persons only upon an Implicit Faith of the
Church; nor their Superstitious and Popish Ceremonies of Salt, and Spittle, and Breathing
on the Face of the party Baptized; together with their Chrisoms and hallowed Lights.269
Neither do we believe, that Infants dying in Infancy without baptism, go to Purgatory or
Limbus Infantum, as they erroneously teach. Nor do we believe, that the Pope of Rome, or
any other Persons whomsoever, have power to alter, or change, this Ordinance of Christ,
as they have done by these Superstitious, and such like Idolatrous Inventions and
Practices of the Romish Church. All which Superstitions of theirs, are contrary to Christ's
Institution, or the Apostles Practice of holy Baptism.

XXX. Article.

Of the Catholick Church as Visible.

NEvertheless, we believe the Visible Church of Christ on Earth, is made up of
several distinct Congregations, which make up that one Catholick Church, or Mystical
Body of Christ. And the Marks by which She is known to be the true Spouse of Christ,
are these, viz. Where the Word of God is rightly Preached, and the Sacraments truly
Administred, according to Christ's Institution, and the Practice of the Primitive
Church;273 having Discipline and Government duly Executed by Ministers or Pastors of
God's Appointing, and the Churches Election, that is a true constituted Church: to which
Church (and not elsewhere) all Persons that seek for Eternal Life, should gladly joyn
themselves.274 And although there may be many Errors in such a Visible Church, or
Congregations, they being not Infallible, yet those Errors being not Fundamental, and the
Church in the major, or Governing part, being not Guilty, she is not thereby unchurched;
nevertheless She ought to detect those Errors,275 and to Reform, according to God's holy
Word, and from such Visible Church, or Congregations, no Man ought by any pretence
whatever, schismatically to separate.276

XXXI. Article.

Of Officers in the Church of Christ.

THe Visible Church of Christ, being completely Gathered and Organized,
according to the Mind of Christ, consists of Officers and Members; and the Officers
(appointed by Christ) to be chosen by his Church, for the peculiar Administration of
Ordinances, and Execution of the Power and Duty Christ hath injoyned them to the end
of the World; And these three, (viz.) 277 Bishops,278 (or Messengers), and Elders,279 (or
Pastors), and Deacons,280 or (Overseers of the Poor): and the Way appointed by Christ,
for the calling of any Person fitted and gifted by the Holy Ghost, unto the Office of
Bishop, or Messenger, in the Churches is, (viz.) That he be chosen thereunto by the

Imposition of Hands, by the Bishops of the same Function, ordinarily; and those Bishops
so Ordained, have the Government of those Churches, that had Suffrage in their
Election,282 and no other ordinarily; as also to preach the Word, or Gospel, to the World,
(or Unbelievers).283 And the particular Pastour, or Elder, in like manner is to be chosen
by the common Suffrage of the particular Congregation, and ordained by the Bishop, or
Messenger284 God hath placed in the Church he hath charge of; and the Elder so
ordained, is to watch over that particular Church; and he may not ministerially act in any
other Church before he be sent,285 neither ought his Power, or Office, any way to infringe
the Liberty, or due Power, or Office of his286 Bishop,287 God being a God of Order,288
having ordained things most harmoniously, tending every way to Unity.289 The Deacons
are in like manner to be chosen by Election and Ordination, and are in their particular
Congregations, to receive the Charity and free Benevolence of the People:290 and the
Bishops and Elders so Chosen, and Ordained, to the Work of God,291 ought to be enabled
and capacitated thereunto, by a sufficient and honourable Maintenance292 of the People
that chose them, answerable to the Dignity of their Places,293 and Charge committed to
them, without which they cannot discharge their Duty (as they ought to do) in studying to
divide the Word of God aright, as St. Paul adviseth Timothy, and also to give themselves
wholly to it;294 and this Maintenance is to be given out of the Labours, Profits, and
Estates of the People, by Equality, and proportionable to their Ability,295 in Liberality,
God having reserved a Portion for all his Labourers, out of all the Members worldly
Goods, and Possessions.

Of the end and right Administration of the Lord's Supper.

THe Supper of the Lord Jesus, was instituted by him the same Night wherein he

was betrayed;297 To be observed in his Church, to the end of the World,298 for the
perpetual Remembrance, and shewing forth the Sacrifice of himself in his Death;299 and
for the Confirmation of the Faithful Believers in all the Benefits of his Death and
Resurrection, and Spiritual Nourishment and growth in him; sealing unto them their
continuance in the Covenant of Grace, and to be a Band and Pledg of Communion with
him, and an Obligation of Obedience to Christ, both passively and actively, as also of our
Communion and Union each with other, in the participation of this holy Sacrament.300
And the outward Elements of Bread and Wine, after they are set apart by the Hand of the
Minister, from common Use, and Blessed, or Consecrated, by the Word of God and
Prayer, the Bread being broken, and Wine poured forth, signifie to the Faithful, the Body
and Blood of Christ,301 or holdeth forth Christ and him Crucified; and the Minister
distributing the Bread and Wine to the Communicants, who are to take, or receive, both
the Bread and Wine at the Hands of the Minister, applying it by Faith,302 with
Thanksgiving to God the Father, for so great a Benefit;303 and no Unbaptized,
Unbelieving, or open Profane, or wicked Heretical Persons, ought to be admitted to this
Ordinance to profane it.304

Neither is that Popish Doctrine of Transubstantiation to be admitted of, nor

Adoration of the unbloody Sacrifice305 of the Mass, as they call it, together with their
denying of the Cup to the Laity, and many more Idolatrous, and Superstitious Practices,
decreed in the Popish Councils of Lateran, and Trent;306 In opposition to which, and such
like Idolatry of Rome, many of our worthy and famous Ancients and renowned
Protestants, lost their lives by Fire and Faggot307 in England, whose Spirits (we hope) are
now in Heaven, as worthy Martyrs and Witnesses of Christ, in bearing a faithful
Testimony to this holy Ordinance of their Lord and Master. Neither may we admit of
Consubstantiation, it being not consonant to God's Word. Nor are little Infants, that
cannot examine themselves, nor give Account of their Faith, nor understand what is

Though St. Austin taught so from John 6:63. and many of the Greek Churches so believe
and practise to this Day. And this holy Ordinance ought to be often celebrated among the
Faithful, with Examination of themselves, (viz.) of their Faith, and Love, and Knowledg,
of these holy and divine Mysteries, lest they eat and drink their own Damnation, for
prophaning of God's holy Ordinance,308 as many (we fear) have done, and (yet) do at this

XXXIV. Article.

Of the Discipline and Government of the Church of Christ.

 WE believe that the Great King, and Law-giver, Christ, the Universal and only
Head of his Church, hath given to his Visible Church, a subordinate Power, or
Authority,309 for the Well-being, Ordering, and Governing of it, for his own Glory, and
the Churches Profit, and Good: The Executive part of which derivative power of
Discipline and Government, is committed to his Ministers, proportionable to their
Dignities and Places in the Church,310 in a most harmonious way, for the Beauty, Order,
Government, and Establishment of the same, and consisteth in the exercise and execution
of the Censors, or Rod of Correction, he hath appointed therein,311 for the Purgation, or
Pruning of the same; in order to prevent Scandals and Offences, both publick and private.
And in case of personal and private Trespasses between Party and Party, that the Member
so offended, tell his Offence to his Brother312 between them alone; and if he shall not
hear him, to take one or two more; if he will not hear him then, to tell it unto the
Church.313 And the Ministers of Christ ought to rebuke them sharply, that sin before them
in the Church;314 and in case there be any wicked, publick, and scandalous Sinners, or
Obstinate Hereticks, that then the Church ought speedily to convene such her Members,
and labour to convict them of their Sin and Heresie, Schism, and Prophaneness,
whatsoever it be; and after such regular Suspension,315 and due Admonition, if such
Sinners repent not; that then for the Honour of God, and preserving the Credit of
Religion, and in order to save the Sinner's Soul, and good of the Church, in obedience to
God's Law, to proceed and excommunicate the Sinner, by a judicial Sentence in the
Name of Christ and his Church,316 tendering an admonition of Repentance to him with
Gravity, Love, and Authority, and all this without Hypocrisie, or Partiality; praying for
the Sinner, that his Soul may be saved in the Day of the Lord. And under this second

Excommunication, it being a most dreadful Thunder-clap of God's Judgment, it is most
difficult, for any Church now to proceed in,318 it being difficult to know when any Man
hath sinned the unpardonable Sin, and so to incur a total Cutting-off from the Church.

XXXV. Article.

Of Communion of Saints, and giving to the Poor.

ALl Christians that have been Baptized into one Faith, and united in one true
Visible Way of Worshipping the true God, by Christ Jesus our Lord,319 should keep the
Unity of the Spirit, in the Bond of Peace,320 seeing there's but one Mystical Body of
Christ, and should have fellowship and communion in each others Sufferings, or
Afflictions; for if one Member suffer, all are pained with it.321 Hence it is also they
partake of each others Gifts in great variety, which make the Harmony of dependency on
each other,322 seeing a need of every Member for the Publick use, and common Profit of
the whole, both in the private as well as more publick and solemn Worship of God's
House: As also an interest in each others Goods and Possessions,323 so far as comports
with Necessity and Charity, according to the Charter-Privileges, or Law of their King;
and though no Equality, or Property, be pleaded for, yet the Works of Charity and Mercy,
must be minded as a Duty to lend to the Lord,324 and pity and relieve the Lord's Poor,325
weekly laying out for them as God hath prospered us,326 according to our Ability in
Freedom, Liberality, and Charity, according to our Brethren's necessity, whether Sick, or
in Prison, to visit and relieve them,327 and not only within the Church, but to all as we
have opportunity and ability to be doing good, Gal. 6.10.

therein unto us, and containeth all things necessary for Salvation;332 so that whatsoever is
not read therein, nor may be proved thereby, is not to be required of any Man, that it
should be believed as an Article of the Christian Faith, or be thought requisite to
Salvation.333 Neither ought we (since we have the Scriptures delivered to us now) to
depend upon, hearken to, or regard the pretended immediate Inspirations, Dreams, or
Prophetical Predictions, by or from any Person whatsoever, lest we be deluded by
them.334 Nor yet do we believe that the Works of Creation, nor the Law written in the
Heart, (viz.) Natural Religion (as some call it), or the Light within Man, as such, is
sufficient to inform Man of Christ the Mediator, or of the way to Salvation, or Eternal
Life by him;335 but the holy Scriptures are necessary to instruct all Men into the way of
Salvation, and eternal Life. And we do believe, that all People ought to have them in their
Mother Tongue,336 and diligently, and constantly to read them in their particular Places
and Families, for their Edification, and Comfort. And endeavour to frame their Lives,
according to the direction of God's Word, both in Faith and Practice, the holy Scriptures
being of no private Interpretation, but ought to be interpreted according to the Analogie
of Faith, and is the best Interpreter of it self;337 and is sole Judge in Controversie.338 And
no Decrees of Popes, or Councils, or Writings of any Person whatsoever, are of equal
Authority with the sacred Scriptures. And by the holy Scriptures we understand, the
Canonical Books of the Old and New Testament, as they are now translated into our
English Mother-Tongue, of which there hath never been any doubt of their Verity, and
Authority, in the Protestant Churches of Christ to this Day.

XXXVIII. Article.

Of the Three Creeds.

THe Three Creeds, (viz.) Nicene Creed, Athanasius his Creed, and the Apostles
Creed, (as they are commonly called) ought throughly to be received, and believed. For
we believe they may be proved by most undoubted Authority of holy Scripture, and are
necessary to be understood of all Christians; and to be instructed in the knowledg of
them, by the Ministers of Christ, according to the Analogie of Faith, recorded in sacred
Scriptures (upon which these Creeds are grounded), and Catechistically opened, and
expounded in all Christian Families, for the edification of Young and Old; which might
be a means to prevent Heresie in Doctrine, and Practice, these Creeds containing all
things in a brief manner, that are necessary to be known, fundamentally, in order to our
Salvation; to which end they may be considered, and better understood of all Men, we
have here Printed them under their several Titles as followeth, (viz.)

The Apostles Creed.

I Believe in God the Father Almighty, Maker of Heaven and Earth;

and in Jesus Christ, his only Son, our Lord: Who was conceived by the Holy
Ghost, born of the Virgin Mary, suffered under Pontius Pilate, was
crucified, dead, and buried, he descended into339 Hell, the third Day he rose
again from the Dead, he ascended into Heaven, he sitteth on the Right Hand
of God the Father Almighty, from thence he shall come to judg the Quick
and the Dead. I believe in the Holy Ghost; the holy Catholick Church; the
Communion of Saints; the Forgiveness of Sins, the Resurrection of the
Body, and the Life everlasting. Amen.

339Not that he (to wit) Christ went into the place of the Damned, but that he went absolutely unto the state of

the Dead. See Dr. Usher, in his Body of Divinity, p.174. And Mr. Perkins on the Creed.

The Nicene Creed.

 WE believe in one God the Father Almighty, Maker of all things
Visible, and Invisible; and in one Lord, Jesus Christ, the Son of God, the
only begotten Son of the Father, that is the Substance of the Father, God of
God, Light of Light, Very God from very God, Begotten, not made, being of
one Substance with the Father, by whom all things were made, both the
Things in Heaven, and the Things in Earth; Who for us Men, and for our
Salvation, came down, and was Incarnate, he was made Man; he suffered,
and rose the third Day, he ascended into the Heavens: He shall come to
judge both the Quick and the Dead. And we believe in the Holy Ghost.
Therefore they which say, there was a time when he was not, before he was
begotten, or that he had his Beginning of nothing, or that he is of another
Substance. Or Essence; or to be Convertible, or Mutable, these the Catholick
and Apostolick Church of God, doth pronounce for Accursed.

Athanasius his Creed.

 WHosoever will be saved: before all things it is necessary that he
hold the Catholick Faith.

Which Faith except every one do keep whole and undefiled, without

doubt he shall perish everlastingly.

And the Catholick Faith is this, That we worship one God in Trinity,

and Trinity in Unity. Neither confounding the Persons, not dividing the
Substance.

For there is one Person of the Father, another of the Son, and another

of the Holy Ghost.

But the Godhead of the Father, of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost, is

all one; the Glory equal, the Majesty Coeternal.

Such as the Father is, such is the Son, and such is the Holy Ghost.
The Father uncreate, the Son uncreate, and the Holy Ghost uncreate.
The Father Incomprehensible, the Son Incomprehensible, and the

Holy Ghost Incomprehensible.

The Father Eternal, the Son Eternal: and the Holy Ghost Eternal; and

yet they are not three Eternals, but one eternal.

As also there are not three Incomprehensibles, nor three Uncreated,

but one Uncreated, and one Incomprehensible.

So likewise the Father is Almighty, the Son Almighty, and the Holy
Ghost Almighty; and yet they are not three Almighties, but one Almighty.

BaptistTheology.org
Page 36 of 46

The Orthodox Creed General Baptists, 1679

So the Father is God, the Son is God, and the Holy Ghost is God; and

yet they are not three Gods, but one God.

So likewise the Father is Lord, the Son Lord, and the Holy Ghost

Lord; and yet not three Lords, but one Lord.

For like as we are compelled by the Christian Verity, to acknowledge

every Person by himself to be God and Lord. So are we forbidden by the
Catholick Religion, to say there be three Gods, or three Lords.

The Father is Made of none, neither created, nor begotten. The Son is
of the Father alone, not made, nor created, but begotten. The Holy Ghost is
of the Father, and of the Son, neither made, nor created, nor begotten, but
proceeding.

So there is one Father, not three Fathers; one Son, not three Sons; one

Holy Ghost, not three Holy Ghosts.

And in this Trinity, none is afore, or after other; none is greater, or
less than another, but the whole three Persons be Coeternal together and
Coequal; so that in all things, as is aforesaid, the Unity in Trinity, and
Trinity in Unity, is to be worshipped.

He therefore that will be saved, must thus think of the Trinity.
Furthermore, it is necessary to everlasting Salvation: that he also

believe rightly the Incarnation of our Lord Jesus Christ.

For the right Faith is, that we believe and confess, that our Lord Jesus
Christ, the Son of God, is God and Man. God of the Substance of the Father,
begotten before the Worlds: And Man of the substance of his Mother, Born
in the World; perfect God, and perfect Man, of a reasonable Soul, and
Humane Flesh subsisting. Equal to the Father as touching his Godhead, and
inferiour to the Father as touching his Manhood; who although he be God
and Man, yet he is not two but one Christ. One not by conversion of the
Godhead into Flesh, but by taking of the Manhood into God. One altogether,
not by confusion of Substance, but by unity of Person: For as the reasonable
Soul and Flesh is one Man, so God and Man is one Christ, who suffered for
our Salvation, descended into Hell, rose again the third Day from the Dead,
he ascended into Heaven, he sitteth on the Right Hand of the Father God
Almighty; from whence he shall come to judge the Quick and the Dead.

At whose coming all Men shall rise again with their Bodies, and shall

give account for their own Works. And they that have done good, shall go
into Life everlasting, and they that have done evil, into everlasting Fire. This
is the Catholick Faith, &c. Which, every one should believe faithfully.

XXXIX. Article.

Of General Councils, or Assemblies.

GEneral councils, or Assemblies, consisting of Bishops, Elders, and Brethren,340
of the several Churches of Christ, and being legally convened, and met together out of all
the Churches, and the Churches appearing there by their Representatives, make but one
Church; and have lawful right and suffrage in the General Meeting, or Assembly, to
act341 in the Name of Christ; It being of Divine Authority,342 and is the best means under
Heaven to preserve Unity, to prevent Heresie, and Superintendency among, or in any
Congregation whatsoever within its own Limits, or Jurisdiction.343 And to such a
Meeting, or Assembly, Appeals ought to be made, in case any Injustice be done, or
Heresie, and Schism countenanced, in any particular Congregation of Christ; and the
Decisive Voice in such General Assemblies is the Major part, and such General
Assemblies have lawful power to Hear, and Determine, as also to Excommunicate.344

XL. Article.

Of Religious Worship, and the Sabbath-Day.

THe Light of Nature sheweth there is a God, who hath a Soveraignty over all,345

but the holy Scripture hath fully revealed it; as also that all Men should worship him
according to God's own Institution and Appointment. And hath limited us, by his own
revealed Will, that he may not be worshipped according to the Imaginations and Devices
of Men, or the Suggestions of Satan, under any visible Representations whatsoever,346 or
any other way not prescribed in the holy Scriptures: and all Religious Worship is to be
given to the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, and to God alone;347 not to Angels, Saints, or
any other Creature, and since the Fall, not without a Mediator,348 nor in the Mediation of
any other but Christ alone;349 nor is this Worshipping of God now under the Gospel, tied
to any place, or made more acceptable by one place than another.350 Yet the Assembly of
the Church, ought not to be neglected by any.351 And in order to his being worshipped,
and served, God hath instituted one Day in Seven,352 for his Sabbath to be kept holy unto

him; which from the Resurrection of Christ, is the First Day of the Week,353 which is
called the Lord's Day, and is to be observed and continued to the end of the World, as a
Christian Sabbath, the last Day of the Week being abolished. And this Christian Sabbath
is to be kept after a due and reverent manner, in preparing of our Hearts, and ordering of
Affairs so beforehand, that we may rest that Day from Worldly and Carnal
Imployments,354 and frequent the solemn Assemblies of the Church,355 and in all publick
and private Duties of Religion; as Hearing, Meditating, and Conferring, and Reading in,
or of the holy Scriptures,356 together with Prayer, publick and private, and in the duties of
Necessity, Charity, and Mercy, and not in any vain or Worldly Discourse, or idle
Recreations whatsoever.357

XLI. Article.

Of publick and private Prayer.

PRayer is an Holy, Religious, and Sacred Ordinance of God;358 and the Duty of

all Men to perform, by the Law of God;359 and to God alone,360 and no other, whether
Saint or Angel; and in the Name of Christ the Mediator;361 and in his Name alone, and no
other, whether Saint or Angel, or any other Creature. And that for all men living, (except
they have sinned the unpardonable Sin) both high and low;362 especially for Ministers
and Magistrates.363 And not for Dead Saints, nor Infernal Spirits. And Prayer is to be
made in a Tongue understood by the People.364 And we ought to pray for all things
necessary, according to the Will of God in Christ Jesus, in a Solemn and Reverent
manner, every way suitable and agreeable to the Platform, or manner of Prayer, which
Christ taught his Disciples, and us,365 in his holy Gospel, which is the only perfect Rule
of all Prayers; and by the assistance of the Holy Spirit of God, without which we cannot
pray aright.366 And this Religious Worship all Men are bound, and required to serve God
in, both publick and private,367 at least two times a Day, in all Christian Families by
Prayers, and Supplications, Intercessions, and giving of Thanks to God the Father, in the
Name and Mediation of Christ Jesus our Lord.368

Of publick Humiliation, by Fasting and Prayer.

PUblick Humiliation, by Fasting and Prayer, is an Ordinance of God, appointed

for his Church and People.369 And it being an extraordinary Duty, especially as it hath
respect to the Church generally, or the Nation as such, and therefore we must have due
regard to the Grounds, Ends, and Manner, of its being performed; confessing of, and
reforming from Sin, both in publick as well as private Fasts.370 Abstaining from our
Pleasures, as also our common Food, in a sensible and real afflicting of our Souls before
the Lord; or to seek to God by Prayer and Fasting for some Spiritual, or Temporal Good,
that God hath promised us, or that we stand in need of. Having due regard to God's Word
and Glory, in this Solemn, or Divine Ordinance.371

XLIII. Article.

Of Family, or Relative Duties therein.

PArents, and Masters, are a sort of Subordinate Governors, and Rulers, in their
respective Jurisdictions and Families; in their respective Relative Places, according to
their Capacities, and Opportunities;372 and are engaged from God's Word, to take Charge
of their Families, and rule and govern them according to the Word of God, both
Husbands, Parents, Masters, and all others concerned in any such Relation;373 and by
their godly and religious Example, instruct their Families:374 they being found carefully
keeping of the Sabbath-Day, in the holy and religious services of hearing the Word
preached, with publick and private prayer. As also requiring and instructing their
Families and Relations, to follow their godly and religious Example, in the private and
publick Exercises of Religion;375 and calling them to an account, how they spend the
Sabbath, and other times, and Mercies they injoy; Especially the reading of the
Scriptures, and hearing the Word preached, with publick Prayer with them, and for them,
in order to a Blessing for them, and their Families. The neglect of which Duty, or Power
of Godliness, and Religion in Families, is one main cause of that wicked Atheism, and
Impiety in the World and Families; and of the carnal Lukewarmness, and Ignorance in
Churches, together with contempt of Government; because many Professors make so
little account, or conscience of performing any duty at Home in their own Families.376

Of Children dying in Infancy.

 WE do believe, that all little Children dying in their Infancy, (viz.) before they
are capable to chuse either Good or Evil,377 whether born of Believing Parents, or
Unbelieving Parents, shall be saved by the Grace of God, and Merit of Christ their
Redeemer, and Work of the Holy Ghost,378 and so being made Members of the Invisible
Church, shall injoy Life everlasting;379 for our Lord Jesus saith, of such belongs the
Kingdom of Heaven.380 Ergo, We conclude, that that opinion is false, which saith, That
those little Infants dying before Baptism, are damned.

Of the Civil Magistrate.

THe Supreme Lord and King of all the World, hath ordained Civil
Magistrates381 to be under Him, over the People for his own Glory, and the Publick
Good. And the Office of a Magistrate, may be accepted of, and executed by Christians,
when lawfully called thereunto;382 and God hath given the power of the Sword into the
hands of all lawful Magistrates, for the defence and incouragement of them that do well,
and for the Punishment of evil-doers,383 and for the maintenance of Justice, and Peace,
according to the wholesome Laws of each Kingdom, and Commonwealth.384 And they
may wage War upon just and necessary Occasions.385 And subjection in the Lord ought
to be yielded to the Magistrates, in all lawful things commanded by them,386 for
Conscience sake,387 with Prayers for them, for a Blessing upon them,388 paying all lawful
and reasonable Custom and Tribute to them, for the assisting of them against Foraign,

Of Liberty of Conscience.

THe Lord Jesus Christ, who is King of kings, and Lord of all by Purchase,390

and is Judg of Quick and Dead, is only Lord of Conscience;391 having a peculiar right so
to be; He having died for that end, to take away the Guilt, and to destroy the filth of Sin;
that keeps the Consciences of all Men in Thraldom, and bondage, till they are set free by
his special Grace. And therefore he would not have the Consciences of Men in Bondage
to, or imposed upon, by any Usurpation, Tyranny, or command whatsoever, contrary to
his revealed Will in his Word,392 which is the only Rule he hath left, for the Consciences
of all Men to be ruled, and regulated, and guided by, through the assistance of his Spirit.
And therefore the obedience to any Command, or Decree, that is not revealed in, or
consonant to his Word, in the holy Oracles of Scripture, is a betraying of the true Liberty
of Conscience.393 And the requiring of an implicite Faith, and an absolute blind
Obedience, destroys Liberty of Conscience, and Reason also, it being repugnant to
both.394 And that no pretended good end whatsoever, by any Man, can make that Action,
Obedience, or Practice, lawful and good, that is not grounded in, or upon the Authority of
holy Scripture, or right Reason agreeable thereunto.395

XLVII. Article.

Of Marriage.

 MArriage is to be between one Man, and one Woman; neither is it lawful for
any Man, to have more than one Wife, nor for any Woman to have more than one
Husband, at the same time.396 And it is lawful for all sorts of People to Marry, who are
able of judgment to give their consent.397 But marriage must not be within the degree of
Consanguinity, or Affinity, forbidden in the Word,398 nor can any such Incestuous
Marriages ever be made lawful by any Law of Man, or consent of Parties, to live together
as Man and Wife.399 And it is the Duty of Christians to Marry in the Lord;400 and
therefore those that profess the true Religion, ought not to marry with infidels, or
idolaters, nor prophane wicked Persons in their life, nor yet with any that maintain
damnable Heresies.

XLVIII. Article.

Of the Lawfulness of an Oath.

A Lawful Oath, is a part of Religious Worship;401 wherein the Person swearing

in Truth, Righteousness, and Judgment,402 solemnly calleth God to witness what he
sweareth, and to judg him according to the Truth, or Falseness thereof.403 And we are to
swear by no other Name, but by the Name of God only,404 when we are called before a
lawful Magistrate, upon a lawful Matter, warranted by God's holy Word;405 and an Oath
is to be taken in the plain and common sence of the words, without Equivocation, or
mental Reservation, in a solemn and reverent using of God's Holy Name;406 and such an
Oath, we believe all Christians, when lawfully called thereunto by the Magistrate, may
take.407 But the foolish monastical vows of Papists, and all idle and vain Swearing, is an
abominable, and wicked prophaning of the holy Name of God.

XLIX. Article.

Of the State of Man after Death, and of the Resurrection of the Dead.

THe Bodies of Men after Death, return to Dust,408 and see Corruption; but their

Souls, or Spirits, which neither die nor sleep, having an Immortal Subsistence,
immediately return to God who gave them;409 the Souls of the Righteous being then
made perfect in Holiness, are received into Paradise where they are with Christ, and
behold the Face of God in Light and Glory, waiting for the full Redemption of their
Bodies;410 and the Souls of the Wicked are cast into Hell, where they remain in Torment
and utter Darkness, reserved to the Judgment of the great Day.411 And besides these two
places, for Souls separated from their Bodies, the holy Scripture mentions none. And at
the last Day, such of the Saints as shall be found alive, shall not sleep, but be Changed;412
and all the Dead shall be raised up with the self-same Bodies, and none other, although
with different Qualities,413 which shall be united to their Souls for ever and ever: but the
Bodies of the unjust, shall by the Power of Christ, as a severe and just Judge, be raised to
Dishonour;414 and the Bodies of the Just and Righteous; by his Spirit, as he is Head of the

and shall enjoy everlasting Life, in singing perpetual Praises, and Hallelujahs to God, for

L. Article.

Of the last Judgment.

ANd lastly, We believe, God hath appointed a Day, wherein he will judg the
World in Righteousness, by Jesus Christ,418 to whom all Power, and Judgment is given of
the Father; in which Day, not only the Apostate Angels shall be judged, but likewise all
Persons that have lived upon the Earth, shall appear before the Tribunal of Christ, to give
an account of their Thoughts, Words, and Deeds,419 and shall receive a just Sentence,
according to what they have done in their Bodies, whether Good, or Evil, when God
according to his purpose, will manifest the glory of his Mercy, in the salvation of his
Elect,420 and of his Justice in the eternal damnation of the Wicked and Disobedient:421 for
then shall the Righteous go into everlasting Life, and receive the fullness of Joy and
Glory;422 but the Wicked, who know not God, nor obey the Gospel offered them in
Christ, shall be cast into eternal Torments,423 and punished with everlasting
Destruction,424 from the presence of the Lord, and from the Glory of his Power. Amen.

Post-script.

Courteous Reader,

I Doubt not but that some of these things before premised in this Confession of
Faith, especially those Articles that relate to the Doctrine of the ever Blessed Trinity, and
Justification by the Blood, Merits, and Satisfaction of Jesus Christ our Saviour; Together
with the Authority of the holy Scriptures, and the Godly Doctrine manifestly asserted in
those three Creeds we have published; all which Doctrine in part, or whole, will have
little entertainment by some, and without question great opposition from many, that do
oppose the Church of England, and others also, as well as us, in these great Fundamental
Truths, wherein we are all agreed, (viz.) The Doctrine of the Trinity, and Christ's
Satisfaction to his Father's Justice, for sinful Man. And no wonder there is such
Instruments, and Cunning Sophisters abroad: For it's evident that Satan knows, that if the
Foundations be destroyed, we shall be at a loss; and what greater Foundation than that
which is laid, even Jesus Christ, (viz.) The True Christ, God Man, or Immanuel, God with
us. But St. Peter sheweth us, that some shall bring in such damnable Heresies into the
World, in denying this true Object of Faith and Worship, and so worship and believe a
meer Idol, and Invention of their own. And now altho these Articles be passed over with
brevity, as some may judge, and yet happily others may, and will conclude they are too
large, and have too much repetition in the Preface, &c. in many of them, which the
Critical will call Tautollogies, &c. Let them if they please; yet the Sober and Intelligent,
will conclude there is need of it; for the benefit of the Ignorant and meaner sort of People,
for whose sakes it is written in a plain manner, for their Instruction, and as brief as it
could for the benefit of the poorer sort, who cannot buy great Volumes.
