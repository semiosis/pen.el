* Leviathan spirit
One thing I can understand from this is that
there are spirits of deception that blind
people, and they may have some influence over prideful people, for
example.

When it is exposed for what it is, it loses its power and hold over people as
soon as they repent for coming under its influence. So there is nothing to fear
from Leviathan because our faith is in the victory that the Lord Jesus Christ
has already won over all the powers of the evil, the victory that is ours
through His blood!

There is a big difference between:
- those who inadvertently come under the influence of this spirit, and
- those who are carriers of this spirit because of their continued pride and
  their refusal to repent. Some serve Leviathan whether they realise it or not;
  others are merely unwilling victims.
