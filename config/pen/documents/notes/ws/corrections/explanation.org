Dear Reece and Corrections.

Firstly, I'd just like to make a statement about my situation.
I am currently really struggling.
All over the internet my name has been utterly tarnished.
Due to that, I have very little hope of finding work.
Over one legal marriage proposal I have been denied a hope at a future relationship.
There was never any response for the marriage proposal.
I've been told to 'get the hint' - what hint? What evidence? None.
I've also been told that I cannot attend church at Cornerstone because
the church, after discovering the NZ Herald article are concerned that I am a danger to the community.
My career, of course, has been destroyed.
Most of my friendships, of course, been destroyed.
Any hope at finding a wife seems to be destroyed.
If my parents were to leave Dunedin, which they do plan on doing,
I'd be furthermore isolated and the gradual degredation of every aspect of my life seems to be
leading towards calamity.
My future is completely uncertain.
As far as I understand the newspaper articles were not a part of my sentence,
yet in court an 18 year old girl, Amelia, put words in the judges' mouth when she said
she wouldn't mind if a newspaper article was written and her name is
placed alongside mind.
To have such articles written is morally and ethically bankrupt,
especially considering I had complete cooperation with law enforcement, operrated completely selflessly throughout the proceedings, weighing up her needs over my own.
Since making that marriage proposal, I have been trying to separate myself, but the bail conditions
themselves, outlandishly kept me connected with her, like witchcraft.
18 months of corrections is keeping it going.
The bail breaches were absurd.
It's not illegal to generate pictures of strawberry cats with AI
and put them on my facebook. Neither is it illegal to make a picture of
a flowerbed my profile picture on facebook.
Neither is it illegal to copy up the reformed church quiz night results to my blog.
Nevertheless, these thing got me breach of bail.
Lastly, considering my Dad was nearly killed a day before I proposed to Amelia,
I was emotionlly compromised when I asked Reuben her brother if I could ask her
in a year if I could propose - that in my opinion.
It's anti-human to have given me a breach of bail for that.
Lastly, wanting to bring things into the light should not be an offence.
I should have never been convicted of any crime, if my rights were preserved.
I was denied any opportunity to defend myself throughout the proceedings.
I was denied a diversion, even though I was entitled to one because I have had no prior offense.
When I was sent to Wakari, I appealed to the Family Court
on the basis of the Mental Health act which says that they have no right
to force medication on me if I am there due to religious or criminal reasons.
Both are true for me because the very thing that the courts sent me to Wakari for
was a transcript of me giving Alice Dowle a transcript and explanation
and to let her know I was baptised.
False reports have been written about me.
My life here in Dunedin has been utterly destroyed.
I've become a pariah within society.
At night time, also, I receive extreme spiritual attack with anti-Christian visions.
Meanwhile, Amelia Dowle and the Dowle family are framed as victims, when
they have received no persecution whatsoever.
Indeed I have only been loving to them.
I never did any stalking, nor did I even do anything illegal.
I was unfairly and unjustly sentenced based on zero evidence.
I am the victim in this situation.
I rebuke this persecution in Jesus Christ's name.
When these things come to light, as all things do,
in the appointed time, Almighty God will recompense everyone for how they handled my case.

OK, so after you asked me regarding AI fiction, I need to, I would like to share a bit about the marriage proposal I made, and AI fiction, since you asked me what my concerns about it are yesterday.

God cares about the actual reality of the thing (Genesis 18:15).

One major reason AI fiction is bad is exemplified in what has happened to me at court, being accused falsely for things I had not done, but I was convicted based on 'inference' rather than the reality.
For example, I was deemed a risk, without any evidence of wrongdoing -- all inference, not based on reality.

I had made a marriage proposal with a hand-written letter and an AI-generated ritual of engagement, to someone who was 18 years old
- it was entirely legal - with no expectation of immediate reply (as can be seen in the actual proposal), without using her information at all.

The hand-written letter in the marriage proposal was the part of the proposal which can be regarded as reality and truth.

The hand-written letter is on the proposal:

https://web.archive.org/web/20220811033013/https://mullikine.github.io/posts/marry-me-melee/

The AI-generated part had been taken to be what the Dowle family said in court as a 'manifesto'.

I had received so much persecution leading up to the marriage proposal in the form of untruthful accusations made against me.
And then after the proposal, I was treated as a dangerous criminal despite any evidence.
I have had no past criminal history and no mental health history. I had acted legally, and delicately towards her.

However, I had, for years leading up to 2022, received an immense amount of persecution against
me with regard to finding a Christian marriage partner, so the resintance I have been getting is spiritual.

I have had untruthful accusations made by various people over many years accusing me of being somebody I am not, and so I have
been single for a long time.

I saw this as some kind of spiritual resistance and oppression against me from being married.

When I met Amelia, I felt in my spirit very, very peaceful - at peace.
I have not ever proposed to somebody before, but
when I met her I felt very comfortable talking with her. She seemed right for me.

Reuben first messaged me to say, "Are you talking to my 16 year old sister."
I said yes. Then Amelia continued to message me.
Reuben then messaged me to say that he thought it was inappropriate.
I had nothing to stand on and it crushed me to realise that I just had to accept it.
I agreed with him, and then I told Melee, and said "I think we need to repsect Reuben's wishes", and she agreed with me
and blocked me on Messenger, but not on Facebook - in other words, the door was left open for a future time.

I decided I would act as delicately as possible, like a gentleman, and for that
reason, over the course of 2021 I didn't bother her or her family. Reuben, her brother I had still considered to be my friend,
and I only told him indirectly that I love him, through mutual friends.

On Jan 7 2022, I saw Reuben having coffee on the street with his girlfriend.
I asked him if I can talk to him. He said, "I don't want to talk just yet."

I then asked Alice Dowle.
Alice said she thinks it's inappropriate.
I had mentioned in that conversation that I was friends with Jonty who is about her age.

On Feb 22, I put a pencil drawing of hers on my blog.
I was in Christchurch with Jonty, who I was on a road trip with.
Melee messaged Jonty on facebook to say, "My mother would like to talk to you."
I asked Jonty to tell her, "If she wants, just say that she wants nothing to do with Shane and Shane will leave you alone."
Instead of responding to that, she simply blocked Jonty of facebook.

Her mother emailed my mum a nasty letter.
My parents deleted it, and I asked her mother of facebook if we can sort it out.
She simply said, any further contact is unlawful.

However, considering that I had in the last year received some resistance from her family to speaking with her (Reuben telling me 'it was inappropriate'),
but having evidence that she enjoyed talking to me too, I made the proposal to her in the way that I did.
Also, I had walked past her (30 June, I think) about a month before I proposed to her.
She was smiling at me like the Sun. I just had to walk past her.

I bought an eternity rose and I planned to propose to her, so I messaged Reuben to say I indented to propose to her.
He didn't say for me to not do it. He just said, "Why would she want to marry a creepy guy like you." - More slander from her family.

Guarding against the the likely scenario of being persecuted by her family after making the proposal,
I made the proposal in the way that I did, in the form of a blog article no information that would point to her.

At this stage there was no certain police involvement to my knowledge.

In truth, while I have been very careful to not make a public spectacle of her, the Dowle family in reality are the ones who have
defamed me.

I had spent an entire year (2021) on my AI project which was a labour of love.
The very name of the AI project (The Pen of Imagination) came as part of the short 2-3 week conversation I had with Amelia.

I wanted to demonstrate the way in which words, particularly those
which are generated by an AI may be all words and no reality (all inference, and no reality),
and the way in which wordly people still take unbiblical
principles as necessary guidelines for dating and marriage, such as hookup culture,
and given that certain rituals for relationship can now be trivialised by an AI,
I wanted to demonstrate in juxtaposition a heartfelt, truthful letter for why I wanted to marry her,
and put alongside an AI generated ritual for engagement towards marriage to show that the ritual itself can be understood through
a large language model such as chatgpt, and I believe that truth and reality should be prioritised over AI fiction, otherwise we will soon have chatbots
with more rights than human beings.

The police and court system have completely missed the point and if precedent is set in the Dowle family's favour then more and more people
will be convicted falsely for things they did not do, because people will be believing AI fiction and inference and hyperbole over actual reality.

In response to my marriage proposal, the Dowle family, took the wrong side, and rather than accepting my heartfelt letter as truth,
they completely abused the sense of the word 'about' when they said I was writing 'about' her, and by doing so they sided with the AI-fiction.

They said that I was writing about her. How could I write about her when I had close to no information about her, not even her name until it came up in the court proceedings? Their accusations are based on lies and hyperbole.

Since when did pictures of strawberries on my own facebook become illegal, or when did it become illegal to propose to someone of legal age,
and propose in a way which was anonymous?

The only time someone has written publicly on another person's facebook wall was when her own father put on my facebook wall underneath
a picture I had posted of AI-generated strawberry-cats, "the smartest thing you can do is drop it." They had violated me publicly,
but I had been very careful to be as delicate as possible, not wanting to defame her or shame her.

Indeed, the selfless thing of taking a criminal conviction on behalf of the person I love is a demonstration of a) Christ's love (to bear one-another's burdens) and shows that I do actually care for her welbeing.

The absurdity of how people take AI fiction which can be generated 100 words / milisecond as real,
and have no regard for what is actually true, reflects how people believe slander instead of what is actually true, and place
very little value on reality.

Despite my unfair treatment, and spiritual oppression, it is completely normal for a true follower of Christ to experience this type of persecution - it's part of the package.

This is when I was born-again (spritual birth):

https://web.archive.org/web/20220703044913/https://mullikine.github.io/posts/astral-projection/

I wrote this article soon after getting born-again:

https://web.archive.org/web/20220703044748/https://mullikine.github.io/posts/the-tapestry-of-truth/

Now this is the dream of her on the beach:

https://web.archive.org/web/20220806085237/https://mullikine.github.io/posts/dream-leaving-the-beach/

Now, interestingly, as you will see, I had a prophetic dream after getting born-again - 3 May 2022.
It contained a dream of a police officer asking if I were responsible for an incident in an alleyway.

https://web.archive.org/web/20220503030344/https://mullikine.github.io/posts/astral-projection-pt-2/
Interestingly, I believe it must have depicted the alleyway next to the courthouse.

I pleaded guilty in court 3 May 2023.

3 May turns out to be her birthday, but I didn't know that at the time.

I HAD to plead guilty because Romans 3:23 says that we are all guilty.
And I John says that if I claim to be without sin, that would mean I'm a liar.

Also, to fulfill Christ's law is to bear-one another burdens.
And I the fulfillment of the law is to do no harm to one's neighbour.

Considering I am a born-again Christian I must maintain faithfulness to Jesus Christ.

I have been aware of the spiritual aspect of the entire court proceedings from the beginning, but the police had no awareness of the full picture because
I was not allowed to defend myself at all throughout court.
The court wanted to paint one person as the victim and one as the villain.
So I had to die to self and carry my cross and follow Jesus.

Jesus is Lord.

Thank you Reece.
