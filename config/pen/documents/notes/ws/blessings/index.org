For we do not want you to be unaware,
brethren, of our affliction which came to us
in Asia, that we were burdened excessively,
beyond our strength, so that we despaired even
of life; indeed, we had the sentence of death
within ourselves so that we would not trust in
ourselves, but in God who raises the dead; who
delivered us from so great a peril of death,
and will deliver us, He on whom we have set
our hope.

And He will yet deliver us, you also joining
in helping us through your prayers, so that
thanks may be given by many persons on our
behalf for the favor bestowed on us through
the prayers of many.

the worthless, You will become My spokesman.

for you, you must not turn to them.

you shall bless the sons of Israel.

You shall say to them: The LORD bless you, and
keep you; The LORD make His face shine on you,
And be gracious to you; The LORD lift up His
countenance on you, And give you peace.’ So
they shall invoke My name on the sons of
Israel, and I then will bless them.”

To sum up, all of you be harmonious,
sympathetic, brotherly, kindhearted, and
humble in spirit; not returning evil for evil
or insult for insult, but giving a blessing
instead; for you were called for the very
purpose that you might inherit a blessing.

You brood of vipers, how can you, being evil,
speak what is good?

For the mouth speaks out of that which fills
the heart.

The good man brings out of his good treasure
what is good; and the evil man brings out of
his evil treasure what is evil.
