* TODO Make a lisp version of bash (bpl) - simply generate bash with elisp macros

Similar to this:
- e:/root/.emacs.d/host/pen.el/src/pen-epl.el
- e:/root/.emacs.d/host/pen.el/src/pen-epl-test.epl

EBL:
- e:/root/.emacs.d/host/pen.el/src/pen-ebl.el
- e:/root/.emacs.d/host/pen.el/src/pen-ebl-test.el

* DONE Make it so when I interact with the following link from my notes, properties are NOT added to all my notes org headings
[[brain:agenda/agenda::Church]]

Problematic code:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh -n :sps bash :async :results none :lang text

But the angel said to them, “Do not be afraid;
for behold, I bring you good news of great joy
which will be for all the people; for today in
the city of David there has been born for you
a Savior, who is Christ the Lord.

This will be a sign for you: you will find a
baby wrapped in cloths and lying in a manger.”
And suddenly there appeared with the angel a
multitude of the heavenly host praising God
and saying, “Glory to God in the highest, And
on earth peace among men with whom He is
pleased.”

And the twenty-four elders and the four living
creatures fell down and worshiped God who sits
on the throne saying, “Amen.

Hallelujah!” And a voice came from the throne,
saying, “Give praise to our God, all you His
bond-servants, you who fear Him, the small and
the great.” Then I heard something like the
voice of a great multitude and like the sound
of many waters and like the sound of mighty
peals of thunder, saying, “Hallelujah! For the
Lord our God, the Almighty, reigns.
