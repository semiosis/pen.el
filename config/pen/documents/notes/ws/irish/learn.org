* Learning Irish
This will take time.

** Alphabet
[[https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&v=_nxu1CssWLk][Irish Language Alphabet - YouTube]]

Irish has fewer letters than the English alphabet.

Letters not available:

#+BEGIN_SRC text -n :async :results verbatim code :lang text
  JKQVWXYZ
#+END_SRC

Vowels can have accent marks:

#+BEGIN_SRC text -n :async :results verbatim code :lang text
  aouie
#+END_SRC

The accent mark is called a s√≠neadh fada.

I guess I could just learn about it, and focus on learning it.
That might be a good distraction.
I keep overthinking stuff.
I've done a lot of overthinking with theology, perhaps.
