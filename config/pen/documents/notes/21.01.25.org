Dear Heavenly Father, and my Lord Jesus Christ,
Almighty God Jehovah,
please, God, set me free.
Please, God, set me free.
What has happened to me regarding being prevented from marrying
and then after getting born-again and proposing to someone,
being prevented from marrying again is criminally evil.
And I'm still prevented from marrying because the entire thing
has been set up so that as You do not speak to me,
which in itself is unkind, I'm being pressured and goaded into
reneging on the letter which I gave to the judge,
which I refuse to do,
and also pressured and goaded into thinking that good is evil,
into thinking that the pure marriage intentions which I had
is idolatry and evil.
Now I think that the setup for this entire situation and
is pure darkness.
It's very, very evil.
Please, God, in Jesus Christ's name, as the Light of the World,
shine some light into the situation, lest the world have no light in it,
because man doesn't live by bread alone but by every word which
proceeds from the mouth of God,
and I need to hear from You, God.
Please, God, lead me into all the Truth,
and please have mercy on me and open doors for me
into a place where I have a good conscience with You,
and freedom to walk in Your will, in Your ways.
And please, LORD, also set Reuben and Melee free.
Please set them free, too, LORD God, to be granted repentance that
leads to life, and an inheritance among the saints.
In Jesus Christ's name I ask,
AMEN!!


Dear Heavenly Father, and my Lord Jesus Christ,
Jehovah God, please, God, let me enter Your door.
I don't want to enter any other door.
Please, Lord Jesus, let me enter Your door.
In Jesus Christ's name I ask,
AMEN!!

Dear Heavenly Father, and my Lord Jesus Christ,
please, God, help me.
I'm sick of the ringing in my ears and head.
It's awful.
I do not understand it.
What do I do?

  *James 4:6-7* - But he gives more grace. Therefore it says, God opposes the proud, but gives grace to the humble. Submit yourselves therefore to God. Resist the devil, and he will flee from you. (ESV)

Dear Heavenly Father, and my Lord Jesus Christ,
please, LORD, protect me.
I want to be sanctified.
Please, God, deliver me from all of the false doctrine and all of the spirit sex stuff
and from all the antichrist spirit stuff.
Please, God, deliver me from all the gnostic stuff.
In Jesus Christ's name I ask,
AMEN!!
