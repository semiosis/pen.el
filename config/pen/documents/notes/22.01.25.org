Dear Heavenly Father, and my Lord Jesus Christ, Son of God,
please, LORD God Jehovah,
please sanctify me in Your Truth.
Please help me to not say anything incorrect.
Please keep purifying my heart.
And please forgive me for complaining.
I'm really tired.
I want to be delivered.
I'm really tired.
Please, God, forgive me.
Please, God, set me free.
Please help Tom as well, LORD.
God Almighty, please sanctify him and help him to turn away from sin.
Please, LORD, help Ian Dalziel to be corrected by the Truth.
Your Word is Truth.
In Jesus Christ's name I ask,
AMEN!!

  *James 4:7-8* - Submit yourselves therefore to God. Resist the devil, and he will flee from you. Draw near to God, and he will draw near to you. Cleanse your hands, you sinners, and purify your hearts, you double-minded. (ESV)

  *Jeremiah 17:7-10* - Blessed is the man who trusts in the LORD, whose trust is the LORD. He is like a tree planted by water, that sends out its roots by the stream, and does not fear when heat comes, for its leaves remain green, and is not anxious in the year of drought, for it does not cease to bear fruit. The heart is deceitful above all things, and desperately sick; who can understand it? I the LORD search the heart and test the mind, to give every man according to his ways, according to the fruit of his deeds. (ESV)
