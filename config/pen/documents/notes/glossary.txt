    | 2 Corinthians 8:1-2
    | ‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾
    | Now, brethren, we wish to make known to you
    | the grace of God which has been given in the
    | churches of Macedonia, that in a great ordeal
    | of affliction their abundance of joy and their
    | deep poverty overflowed in the wealth of their
    | liberality.

Maranatha
    Our Lord has come.

    First recorded in 1350–1400; from Late
    Latin Marana tha, from Greek marána thá,
    from Aramaic māranā thā, of uncertain
    meaning, traditionally translated “O Lord,
    come!” or, if the Aramaic phrase is māran
    ăthā, “Our Lord has come”

    1 Corinthians 16:22
    If anyone does not love the Lord, he is to be
    accursed. Maranatha.

    Didache
    10:6 Let grace come, and let this world
    pass away.  Hosanna to the Son of David.
    If any one is holy let him come (to the
    Eucharist); if any one is not, let him
    repent. Maranatha. Amen.

hinge moment
    An experience or season of time that has
    changed the trajectory of one's life.

deacon
diaconate
    A deacon is a member of the diaconate, an
    office in Christian churches that is
    generally associated with service of some
    kind, but which varies among theological
    and denominational traditions.

covenantal nomism
    Covenantal nomism, in opposition to merit
    theology, is the belief that 1st century
    Jews in the land of Israel did not believe
    in works righteousness.

    i.e. God gives a person the grace to be in
    the Covenant, and then works keep a person
    in the Covenant.

hallowed
    Made holy; consecrated.
    "hallowed ground"

    Greatly revered and honoured.
    "the band will be in some hallowed and
    historic surroundings"

costly grace
    We should not just accept this grace as a
    given thing; we should make it costly to
    ourselves as well.
    
    Grace is a gift from God that we did not
    deserve and by bestowing upon his children
    this gift, God is calling us to follow
    Jesus even if it costs us.
