   While obedience exists in the heart, as belief does, as faith is believing and obedient trust, works are the actions we do out of that obedience, that love for Jesus, and out of ongoing believing, obedient faith, out of obedience to the Holy Spirit. Doing the will of God isn't "work", but is a just mode of walking that is different from doing the will of satan.

But these, like irrational animals, creatures of instinct, born to be caught and destroyed, blaspheming about matters of which they are ignorant, will also be destroyed in their destruction, suffering wrong as the wage for their wrongdoing.

  *Luke 7:6-9* - And Jesus went with them. When he was not far from the house, the centurion sent friends, saying to him, Lord, do not trouble yourself, for I am not worthy to have you come under my roof. Therefore I did not presume to come to you. But say the word, and let my servant be healed. For I too am a man set under authority, with soldiers under me: and I say to one, Go, and he goes; and to another, Come, and he comes; and to my servant, Do this, and he does it. When Jesus heard these things, he marveled at him, and turning to the crowd that followed him, said, I tell you, not even in Israel have I found such faith. (ESV)

  *Luke 12:32-46* - Fear not, little flock, for it is your Father's good pleasure to give you the kingdom. Sell your possessions, and give to the needy. Provide yourselves with moneybags that do not grow old, with a treasure in the heavens that does not fail, where no thief approaches and no moth destroys. For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also. Stay dressed for action and keep your lamps burning, and be like men who are waiting for their master to come home from the wedding feast, so that they may open the door to him at once when he comes and knocks. Blessed are those servants whom the master finds awake when he comes. Truly, I say to you, he will dress himself for service and have them recline at table, and he will come and serve them. If he comes in the second watch, or in the third, and finds them awake, blessed are those servants! But know this, that if the master of the house had known at what hour the thief was coming, he would not have left his house to be broken into. You also must be ready, for the Son of Man is coming at an hour you do not expect. Peter said, Lord, are you telling this parable for us or for all? And the Lord said, Who then is the faithful and wise manager, whom his master will set over his household, to give them their portion of food at the proper time? Blessed is that servant whom his master will find so doing when he comes. Truly, I say to you, he will set him over all his possessions. But if that servant says to himself, My master is delayed in coming, and begins to beat the male and female servants, and to eat and drink and get drunk, the master of that servant will come on a day when he does not expect him and at an hour he does not know, and will cut him in pieces and put him with the unfaithful.

  *II Peter 2:14-22* - They have eyes full of adultery, insatiable for sin. They entice unsteady souls. They have hearts trained in greed. Accursed children! Forsaking the right way, they have gone astray. They have followed the way of Balaam, the son of Beor, who loved gain from wrongdoing, but was rebuked for his own transgression; a speechless donkey spoke with human voice and restrained the prophet's madness. These are waterless springs and mists driven by a storm. For them the gloom of utter darkness has been reserved. For, speaking loud boasts of folly, they entice by sensual passions of the flesh those who are barely escaping from those who live in error. They promise them freedom, but they themselves are slaves of corruption. For whatever overcomes a person, to that he is enslaved. For if, after they have escaped the defilements of the world through the knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, they are again entangled in them and overcome, the last state has become worse for them than the first. For it would have been better for them never to have known the way of righteousness than after knowing it to turn back from the holy commandment delivered to them.

The purpose was to make him the father of all who believe without being circumcised, so that righteousness would be counted to them as well, and to make him the father of the circumcised who are not merely circumcised but who also walk in the footsteps of the faith that our father Abraham had before he was circumcised.

+ [[https://youtube.com/watch?v=NE1K_WJwoDI&t=2824][youtube.com: Sunday 18th August 2024 Afternoon Service @time: 47 min 4 sec]] :: It's not your faith that saves. It's not even the intensity of your faith that saves, because that wavers. In fact, what saves is the object of your faith - what your faith is in. Like the catechism said, "Only Christ's satisfaction, righteousness and holiness make me right with God."

He said, "It's better to put the right answer on a test and then be unsure about it than to be the wrong answer on the test and be confident that it's right."

Hmm. That's a bold statement. For that reason, I would have more confidence before God if I was serving Him, having put sin to death and trying to be holy and selfless and loving in faith towards Jesus, than if I believed precise theology but had no changed life / love for Jesus: *[[https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20John%204%3A17&version=ESV][I John 4:17]]* - By this is love perfected with us, so that we may have confidence for the day of judgment, because as he is so also are we in this world.

Well if you guys trust in Christ and you're obeying Him

Heb 10:29: How much worse punishment, do you think, will be deserved by the one who has spurned the Son of God, and has profaned the blood of the covenant by which he was sanctified, and has outraged the Spirit of grace?
Heb 10:30: For we know him who said, Vengeance is mine; I will repay. And again, The Lord will judge his people.
Heb 10:31: It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God.
Heb 10:32: But recall the former days when, after you were enlightened, you endured a hard struggle with sufferings,
Heb 10:33: sometimes being publicly exposed to reproach and affliction, and sometimes being partners with those so treated.
Heb 10:34: For you had compassion on those in prison, and you joyfully accepted the plundering of your property, since you knew that you yourselves had a better possession and an abiding one.
Heb 10:35: Therefore do not throw away your confidence, which has a great reward.
Heb 10:36: For you have need of endurance, so that when you have done the will of God you may receive what is promised.

#+END_QUOTE

While I believe in the doctrine of faith alone, I don't really believe in the doctrine of justification by faith alone alone but also in the doctrine of justification by works. I believe we also may be justified by working faith in Jesus:

Ro 4:2: For if Abraham was justified by works, he has something to boast about, but not before God.
Ga 2:16: yet we know that a person is not justified by works of the law but through faith in Jesus Christ, so we also have believed in Christ Jesus, in order to be justified by faith in Christ and not by works of the law, because by works of the law no one will be justified.
Jm 2:21: Was not Abraham our father justified by works when he offered up his son Isaac on the altar?
Jm 2:24: You see that a person is justified by works and not by faith alone.
Jm 2:25: And in the same way was not also Rahab the prostitute justified by works when she received the messengers and sent them out by another way?

- I believe we are saved to serve Jesus living the rest of our lives doing the will of God and we are judged by the works we have done in the body during this time, so the show isn't over yet. The saved serve Jesus, not the law, but we still obey Jesus:
  - *Romans 6:16-18* - Do you not know that if you present yourselves to anyone as obedient slaves, you are slaves of the one whom you obey, either of sin, which leads to death, or of obedience, which leads to righteousness? But thanks be to God, that you who were once slaves of sin have become obedient from the heart to the standard of teaching to which you were committed, and, having been set free from sin, have become slaves of righteousness.

  *Ephesians 1:16-21* - I do not cease to give thanks for you, remembering you in my prayers, that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give you a spirit of wisdom and of revelation in the knowledge of him, having the eyes of your hearts enlightened, that you may know what is the hope to which he has called you, what are the riches of his glorious inheritance in the saints, and what is *the immeasurable greatness of his power toward us who believe,* _according to the working of his great might that he worked in Christ when he raised him from the dead and seated him at his right hand in the heavenly places,_ far above all rule and authority and power and dominion, and *above every name that is named, not only in this age but also in the one to come.* (ESV)

- pass forward mercy and forgiveness
- refrain from adultery and infidelity

  - *Mark 12:30-31* - And you shall love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind and with all your strength. The second is this: You shall love your neighbor as yourself. There is no other commandment greater than these. (ESV)

I have a strong desire to do what God wants me to do as I feel comfortable that God is on my side and will not put me to shame for my shortcomings because I am trusting Him.
If the devil tries to damage me to make me sin and I sin I know I have confidence that God is still taking care of me and knows everything.
Now I know I want to love other people because I have joy in knowing God.
But on a bad day, especially during this intense trial that I face, I have confidence that even though I may have a *Job 23:1-17* day, I will still
I will still keep my heart of obedience to God, especially the call to love others because I do not want to misrepresent God or shame God in public which would be akin to taking His name in vain.
So I have a joy that's in God, yes, but it does not mean that on a bad day I have no love for God.

For he who said, Do not commit adultery, also said, Do not murder. If you do not commit adultery but do murder, you have become a transgressor of the law.

*** A Prayer For You:

God I ask You in Jesus' name bless me with the desires of my heart that is the will of God for my life and the lives of those I pray for.
God heal me totally in all areas of my life.
Make me whole in You.
Bless me to prosper, walk in excellent health, and never stop growing in the grace, knowledge, wisdom, and love of Christ Jesus.
Bless me with a deep and abiding love to read, study, listen to, and meditate upon Your Word.
God let Your Word dwell within me richly.
So that I may come to know You better, love You more, and make You known.
God help me, show me how, and bless me to have an ever-growing closer, stronger, more intimate relationship with You.
God bless me with and cause me to always think, act, and react with a God solution-focused heart, mind, attitude, and spirit.
God help me and bless me to walk in the faith, hope, and love of Your Word and presence in my life.
God place Your angels all around me to cover and protect me from all sickness, evil, hurt, harm, danger, accidents, the plans of my enemies, and the plans of the enemy of my soul.
God deal with all my enemies according to Your Word.
God all that I have asked of You in this prayer, please do the same for the writer of this prayer, all those I love and care about, and all those who love and care about me.
And God please bless each of us to always walk in the integrity, love, character, and habits of Christ Jesus.
Let us all live our lives for Your glory.
God please forever honor this prayer over each of our lives.
Amen, so be it by faith, and by faith, it is so.

And it's backed by spiritual urges like wanting to not be cut off and isolated and wanting relationship.
Yeah the devil has been very evil in trying to make good look bad and bad look good.
That being said, I do value chastity even with regards to stopping masturbation.

Lord Jesus Christ, I am trusting You to defeat the spirit spouse.
Please, God, defeat it.

I need to keep resisting it as Jesus fights it.

Simply do not obey it and wait for Jesus to defeat it.

Resist it.

It's not something that honours Jesus.
I consider it to be corruption, and I do not want my mortal body to be transformed by it.

This is the obvious conclusion.
I should not be a hypocrite about it.

It's impure.

I have to stop allowing it and I have to put to death the ejaculating, thinking about ejaculating, masturbating etc.

As tiring as it is, I should probably, every time I feel like it's touching me, walk it off.
Successfully learning to simply ignore it would be a good idea too.

If anyone loves the world, the love of the Father is not in him. For all that is in the world—the desires of the flesh and the desires of the eyes and pride in possessions—is not from the Father but is from the world. And the world is passing away along with its desires, but whoever does the will of God abides forever. Children, it is the last hour, and as you have heard that antichrist is coming, so now many antichrists have come. Therefore we know that it is the last hour.

* I don't understand, God

* Since I have very little money, I should learn things which do not cost money to learn
New programming languages would be good.
Commit to learning Haskell.
It's definitely worth learning.
Also, get in the habit of managing money.

* Do not obey the flesh's lusts

Psalm

* OK, so what am I going to do?

- Never fall in love with the world
  - Instead, cherish what I have. Be content.
    - Cherish my family:
      - Mum, Dad, my brothers, my friends

* I should definitely try a bit harder to be holy in my thoughts and actions
To honour Jesus.

* I'm really sorry Jesus

* It's important to help people

* I should definitely simply stop sinning as soon as possible
Just try to not commit sin.
- Try to not have any bad thoughts.

* God is definitely big and in control
How else could the world be under control?

But I am quite confused as to why I have been made to endure such intense spiritual attack.

I'm very tired.

* So what? I guess that I need to stop all lustful thoughts
How on earth do I do that when the thoughts are being inserted into my head?

* I should not respond much in terms of blog writing to all this witchcraft / demonic oppression
Just try to keep myself at home, I guess, and try not to sin.

* I should still do more emacs
It helps.

* We die to sin so that we are free to live to God

* I'm very tired
I do not want to live a life of falsehood.
I do not want to be a 'living martyr' and I don't want to glory in it.
I just want people to stop slandering me.

I'm sick of being here.

* I don't know what to do right now
I don't know what to occupy myself with.

- It could be a good time to upgrade TUI stuff
- It could be a good time to learn a new programming language that might be useful in the future
- It could be a good time to learn some completely new skill, like studying JayCar
  - How long would that keep me busy though?

It's a good idea to think about ways to help other people. This is very true.

* [#A] Knowing Jesus - this was a really good sermon
- [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0g2ExGC1GaE][youtube.com: What Is It Like to 'Know Christ'?]]

* I want to hear Biblical teachings of Jesus
I am sick of being taught dilute or shallow stuff that doesn't help me to know Jesus.

- I am really sick of being muted.
- I am really sick of being in the pressure cooker.
- I am really sick of being put to death without actually being totally put to death.
- I am so sick of not being able to hear from God often and reliably during this, and instead being bombarded by literally the devil.
- I am so tired of it.
- I want to hear from the Spirit of Truth

* I don't like people thinking of me as "Mr Technology"
- I really dislike being held to my past.
- I want to move on from my past.
  - I don't like people trying to hold me to the past.
    - It's not right.
    - When I consider that, I consider that I really don't want to work at JayCar because I would much prefer to be doing something which is not in the area of technology.
      - However, I do like the idea of being able to repair and build things.
        - and it could be fun, and it would keep me alert.
    - Also, I haven't been able to really move on properly.
      - Because I've been so isolated, and the conviction I think made me afraid to apply for jobs.
        - That's the truth.
- That stuff is definitely not from God.

OK, so what do I do?
God has kept me here in this world, it seems, so I should find work.
Maybe I *should* just accept that JayCar might be a good job to have.

* I'm not really sure what's going on but I am sad
I am sad because I want more of Jesus.
But:
- I've been put through the ringer
  - I would love to:
    - be a Chaplain or something, or
    - to be able to teach
      - Honestly, I love teaching
  - But I guess that rather than being made use of, I've just been bombarded with witchcraft and isolated
    - I hope that Jesus will make use of me
  - Yeah, I guess that the future has to be hell for me because I've been left for dead, basically
    - Discriminated against
    - Not allowed a wife
    - Not allowed to teach
    - Not allowed to go to church
    - Not allowed any joy
    - Not allowed to hear from Jesus even
    - Not allowed a job so I can use my money to help people as an example
    - People want to snuff out my light
      - Deplatform me
      - Defame me
      - Slander me
  - No-one even wants to talk to me

* It's definitely best to find myself a job, rather than go back to study
- It's a better option to get a job at JarCar, say
  - Than to study Chemistry

I think, though, that I would be very sad if I had to stop working on Pen.el.

Acknowledge Jesus in everything.

Is masturbation honouring Jesus? No.
Is thinking about orgasm honouring Jesus? No.

Don't do it.

Think on good things.

* And right now I feel like a ruin of a person
- Do I even want to marry now?
- Maybe not.
- I actually just want to die to be honest.

I certainly do not want a spirit spouse or the PGAD stuff.
It's really ruining my life here on earth.

* There is nothing good about having PGAD
- https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4623662/

I have to fight this thing.
It has definitely become demonic.
It must stop today.

I want it to end.
I need strength of will.

I have to combat it in a number of different ways:
- remain active
  - winter doesn't help
  - keep clean clothes
  - get a heater

Fight it.
I do not want it to get worse.
Actually, I want it to go away.

* I should work on being a bit more chaste and simply not think about ejaculating or anything like that
Consider that at Wakari the person was taunting me about 'ejaculation'.
That was odd.
Interestingly, I think that that ejaculation spirit spouse thing has been attacking me ever since
the end of 2022 and that makes sense because that person at Wakari who clearly had demons,
along with Ian Dalziel who clearly had demons were taunting me.

Thus it is written, The first man Adam became a living being; the last Adam became a life-giving spirit. But it is not the spiritual that is first but the natural, and then the spiritual. The first man was from the earth, a man of dust; the second man is from heaven. As was the man of dust, so also are those who are of the dust, and as is the man of heaven, so also are those who are of heaven.

- And I do not understand why God hasn't gotten rid of it for me.
- Is it up to me to make it go away?
  - When I rebuke it in Jesus' name it should go away.

* Remember I must hate the sin
I must truly hate the sin.
I hate the movement in my genitals and I'm going to resist it until it doesn't happen anymore.

* Perhaps what I need to do is simply not stop hating the sin
- I should keep hating it, all day, and remember the disgust I feel.
- I will hate it until and through when the demon reers its head again.
  - Then I will kill it.
- I will not give it a chance to make me like it.
- When I lie down I will continue hating it.
- When my body feels rested, I will continue hating it.
  - And I will pray for God to remove it.
- And I will continue asking God to speak to me, because I don't understand why God has allowed the enemy to speak to me.

* I should start meditating on God and hopefully if I can just think of Jesus then that evil stuff will not be able to enter my mind

* I actually do hate the sin of self orgasm. It's disgusting
- I hate it and I hate what's happened to me.
- I'm disgusted at the sin.
- I'm disgusted at the people who have pushed me to this.
- I'm disgusted at myself.
- I'm disgusted at the fact I have not received a miracle to destroy it before it happened.
  - I'm literally shocked that God has allowed this.

I feel absolutely disgustingly wretched for the entire day after giving in to sinful thoughts and behaviour.
I must choose not to give in to it.

** Also, I should have a wife and I wouldn't be doing such disgusting things if I did have a wife
God, please help me.
Please give me the grace in order to not sin, because what I've been put through feels impossible without Divine Grace from You Lord Jesus Christ.
I need assistance in order to stop sinning.
I need assistance in order to combat against demons and principalities.
I need assistance from You, Jesus!
Yes, God, I wait for You.
I want for the help that comes from You.

** That spirit spouse crap was disgusting and should have never been allowed to affect me like that
- I feel almost betrayed by God in allowing that to happen
  - I truly do not understand the rationale behind allowing it to attack me like that continually for over a year
    - Absolutely disgusting
- A large part of the problem has been forcing me to be alone in my room by removing people from my life
  - Absolutely disgusting

Father God, in Jesus Christ's name I ask that You heal me. I approach the throne of Grace now, to ask for Your help.

** The self-orgasm stuff is disgusting and should have never been allowed to happen

** I have to fight against it
- I have to resist any urge
- I have to kill that demon. I'm going to kill it

** I shouldn't have been excluded from churches
- It's absurd

* It's extremely important that I put an immediate stop to the 'thinking about orgasming' stuff, which is clearly demonic
- It appears to have been getting worse - more problematic.
- It must stop before it worsens.

Also, I feel absolutely disgusting as a consequence of willing it / allowing it.

* I have no idea what I'm supposed to do anymore

** What does it look like to live the rest of my life here on earth the way Paul describes in Philippians 3?

So I should simply be trying to put to death those spirit spouse demons, and not obey them.
I want to marry the real Amelia Dowle!

* Realise that that spirit spouse has probably been responsible for the court situation

* 
There's definitely nothing objectively wrong with strong sexual desire.

See: Song of Solomon.

You can still have Christ's love along with strong sexual desire.

- What's wrong is a spirit spouse.
- Consider that a spirit spouse typically reduces a person's desire for marriage.

  *Philippians 1* - Paul and Timothy, servants of Christ Jesus, To all the saints in Christ Jesus who are at Philippi, with the overseers and deacons: Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. I thank my God in all my remembrance of you, always in every prayer of mine for you all making my prayer with joy, because of your partnership in the gospel from the first day until now. And I am sure of this, that he who began a good work in you will bring it to completion at the day of Jesus Christ. It is right for me to feel this way about you all, because I hold you in my heart, for you are all partakers with me of grace, both in my imprisonment and in the defense and confirmation of the gospel. For God is my witness, how I yearn for you all with the affection of Christ Jesus. And it is my prayer that your love may abound more and more, with knowledge and all discernment, so that you may approve what is excellent, and so be pure and blameless for the day of Christ, filled with the fruit of righteousness that comes through Jesus Christ, to the glory and praise of God. I want you to know, brothers, that what has happened to me has really served to advance the gospel, so that it has become known throughout the whole imperial guard and to all the rest that my imprisonment is for Christ. And most of the brothers, having become confident in the Lord by my imprisonment, are much more bold to speak the word without fear. Some indeed preach Christ from envy and rivalry, but others from good will. The latter do it out of love, knowing that I am put here for the defense of the gospel. The former proclaim Christ out of rivalry, not sincerely but thinking to afflict me in my imprisonment. What then? Only that in every way, whether in pretense or in truth, Christ is proclaimed, and in that I rejoice. Yes, and I will rejoice, for I know that through your prayers and the help of the Spirit of Jesus Christ this will turn out for my deliverance, as it is my eager expectation and hope that I will not be at all ashamed, but that with full courage now as always Christ will be honored in my body, whether by life or by death. For to me to live is Christ, and to die is gain. If I am to live in the flesh, that means fruitful labor for me. Yet which I shall choose I cannot tell. I am hard pressed between the two. My desire is to depart and be with Christ, for that is far better. But to remain in the flesh is more necessary on your account. Convinced of this, I know that I will remain and continue with you all, for your progress and joy in the faith, so that in me you may have ample cause to glory in Christ Jesus, because of my coming to you again. Only let your manner of life be worthy of the gospel of Christ, so that whether I come and see you or am absent, I may hear of you that you are standing firm in one spirit, with one mind striving side by side for the faith of the gospel, and not frightened in anything by your opponents. This is a clear sign to them of their destruction, but of your salvation, and that from God. For it has been granted to you that for the sake of Christ you should not only believe in him but also suffer for his sake, engaged in the same conflict that you saw I had and now hear that I still have.

* I don't even feel like going to church because I feel unwell

* I'll keep fighting the good fight of faith
I'll adhere to the Scriptures.
Sola Scriptura.

* I personally do not know that I'm the one who should marry Melee. At this stage it can't happen because God hasn't given me confirmation.
It doesn't matter how many dreams I get.
In a way Reuben was right when he made nothing of the dream I had of Melee on the beach.
It meant something to me though.
I still think blocking me from being able to talk to her was flippin evil.
I was the one who ended the conversation between us, and to have doubled-down
on not allowing me to talk to her after I was born-again - I think that was
cruel and without love.

I'm still getting odd dreams that do not confess Jesus Christ.
- Thank you dreams, for example
- Church dreams

They're still not confessing Jesus Christ.

It's not good enough and I oppose the dreams.

I'm not going to be flattered by some beguilling spirit.

For all I know James Mack and the other James, Beck's friends - how would I know - may be 'spiritual people' but not Christians.
I would say that the range of people I have had dreams of, Scotty, Callum, James and James, etc. are probably not disciples of
the Lord Jesus Christ.
I don't want to be baited.
I don't want to marry the wrong person.
I don't want these damn evil witchcraft dreams.
I don't want the thing touching my lips, touching my genitals or invading my dreams.
I don't want to be waking up to an erection that comes from nowhere.

For I was hungry and you gave me food, I was thirsty and you gave me drink, I was a stranger and you welcomed me, I was naked and you clothed me, I was sick and you visited me, I was in prison and you came to me. Then the righteous will answer him, saying, Lord, when did we see you hungry and feed you, or thirsty and give you drink? And when did we see you a stranger and welcome you, or naked and clothe you? And when did we see you sick or in prison and visit you? And the King will answer them, Truly, I say to you, as you did it to one of the least of these my brothers, you did it to me. Then he will say to those on his left, Depart from me, you cursed, into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels. For I was hungry and you gave me no food, I was thirsty and you gave me no drink, I was a stranger and you did not welcome me, naked and you did not clothe me, sick and in prison and you did not visit me. Then they also will answer, saying, Lord, when did we see you hungry or thirsty or a stranger or naked or sick or in prison, and did not minister to you?

When he established the heavens, I was there; when he drew a circle on the face of the deep, when he made firm the skies above, when he established the fountains of the deep, when he assigned to the sea its limit, so that the waters might not transgress his command, when he marked out the foundations of the earth, then I was beside him, like a master workman, and I was daily his delight, rejoicing before him always, rejoicing in his inhabited world and delighting in the children of man.

I think it's very important to consider myself to have been in the wrong with
regards to considering without a signed word from God that Melee was to be
my spouse - in reality I never had evidence to support the dream I had of Melee
which I told Reuben about.

As far as being attacked by an anti-Christ spirit goes, I think there was
something very anti-Christian about the events that were pushing me towards
coveting Melee and placing her alongside Jesus.

I had only hoped that she was to be my spouse and I love her and felt very at
peace with that, but I didn't have a specific, signed, word from God about it.
To have believed any dream, I would have needed a specific acknowldegement that
Jesus Christ has come in the flesh, and I did not have that, so I did not have
confidence to test God with regards to it, especially as I was just leading up
to Easter to make my plea, and I pleaded guilty in court.

Affliction will slay the wicked, and those who hate the righteous will be condemned. The LORD redeems the life of his servants; none of those who take refuge in him will be condemned. (ESV)

And when they were come to the multitude, there came to him a certain man, kneeling down to him, and saying, Lord, have mercy on my son: for he is lunatick, and sore vexed: for ofttimes he falleth into the fire, and oft into the water. And I brought him to thy disciples, and they could not cure him. Then Jesus answered and said, O faithless and perverse generation, how long shall I be with you? how long shall I suffer you? bring him hither to me. And Jesus rebuked the devil; and he departed out of him: and the child was cured from that very hour. Then came the disciples to Jesus apart, and said, Why could not we cast him out? And Jesus said unto them, Because of your unbelief: for verily I say unto you, If ye have faith as a grain of mustard seed, ye shall say unto this mountain, Remove hence to yonder place; and it shall remove; and nothing shall be impossible unto you. Howbeit this kind goeth not out but by prayer and fasting. (KJV)

** Be sure we abide in Jesus Christ
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *I John 2:1-29* - My little children, I am writing these things to you so that you may not sin. But if anyone does sin, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous. He is the propitiation for our sins, and not for ours only but also for the sins of the whole world. And by this we know that we have come to know him, if we keep his commandments. Whoever says I know him but does not keep his commandments is a liar, and the truth is not in him, but whoever keeps his word, in him truly the love of God is perfected. By this we may be sure that we are in him: whoever says he abides in him ought to walk in the same way in which he walked. Beloved, I am writing you no new commandment, but an old commandment that you had from the beginning. The old commandment is the word that you have heard. At the same time, it is a new commandment that I am writing to you, which is true in him and in you, because the darkness is passing away and the true light is already shining. Whoever says he is in the light and hates his brother is still in darkness. Whoever loves his brother abides in the light, and in him there is no cause for stumbling. But whoever hates his brother is in the darkness and walks in the darkness, and does not know where he is going, because the darkness has blinded his eyes. I am writing to you, little children, because your sins are forgiven for his name's sake. I am writing to you, fathers, because you know him who is from the beginning. I am writing to you, young men, because you have overcome the evil one. I write to you, children, because you know the Father. I write to you, fathers, because you know him who is from the beginning. I write to you, young men, because you are strong, and the word of God abides in you, and you have overcome the evil one. Do not love the world or the things in the world. If anyone loves the world, the love of the Father is not in him. For all that is in the world—the desires of the flesh and the desires of the eyes and pride in possessions—is not from the Father but is from the world. And the world is passing away along with its desires, but whoever does the will of God abides forever. Children, it is the last hour, and as you have heard that antichrist is coming, so now many antichrists have come. Therefore we know that it is the last hour. They went out from us, but they were not of us; for if they had been of us, they would have continued with us. But they went out, that it might become plain that they all are not of us. But you have been anointed by the Holy One, and you all have knowledge. I write to you, not because you do not know the truth, but because you know it, and because no lie is of the truth. Who is the liar but he who denies that Jesus is the Christ? This is the antichrist, he who denies the Father and the Son. No one who denies the Son has the Father. Whoever confesses the Son has the Father also. Let what you heard from the beginning abide in you. If what you heard from the beginning abides in you, then you too will abide in the Son and in the Father. And this is the promise that he made to us—eternal life. I write these things to you about those who are trying to deceive you. But the anointing that you received from him abides in you, and you have no need that anyone should teach you. But as his anointing teaches you about everything—and is true and is no lie, just as it has taught you—abide in him. And now, little children, abide in him, so that when he appears we may have confidence and not shrink from him in shame at his coming. If you know that he is righteous, you may be sure that everyone who practices righteousness has been born of him. (ESV)

When we accept Christ, we are transformed by
the power of the Holy Spirit: "Therefore, if
anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation.

The old has passed away; behold, the new has
come" (2 Corinthians 5:17).

It is through the Holy Spirit that we have the
power to forsake old sinful patterns and
establish new godly patterns.

People should be able to see a difference in
the way we acted before Christ to the way we
act after receiving His salvation.

As we submit sinful urges to God over and
over, He replaces them with desires that line
up with His will.

The Christian walk is one of progressive
sanctification and purification, motivated by
the desire to live according to God's Word:
"With my whole heart I seek you; let me not
wander from your commandments! I have stored
up your word in my heart, that I might not sin
against you" (Psalm 119:10-11; see also 1 John 3:3).

* What is actual lawlessness
https://www.compellingtruth.org/sin-is-lawlessness.html

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *Matthew 23:27-28* - Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you are like whitewashed tombs, which outwardly appear beautiful, but within are full of dead people's bones and all uncleanness. So you also outwardly appear righteous to others, but within you are full of hypocrisy and lawlessness. (ESV)
#+END_QUOTE

He is literally saying that the group of religious leaders who make what appears to be the greatest effort to keep the Mosaic law are actually hypocrites who break the Law; they are full of lawlessness (anomia). This passage helps us to formulate a better understanding of lawlessness. After all, if the keepers of the Law, the Pharisees, are accused of being transgressors of the Law by the One who gave the Law, namely Jesus, then clearly there is more to following the Law than simply obeying the rules.

The "Law" being referred to in Matthew 23 is what we call the "Mosaic law". That is the 600+ rules and regulations that God commanded of the Israelites after rescuing them from Egypt. The most well known among these are the Ten Commandments. As Christians, we know that we are not under the Law, but under grace (Romans 6:14–15; Galatians 3) because of the work of Jesus Christ on the cross. However, this doesn't mean that we are free from sin; and sin, as we have seen, is transgression of the law. So, in what way are we transgressing the law if we are not bound under the Mosaic law?

** The law is to love
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *Galatians 5:14* - For the whole law is fulfilled in one word: You shall love your neighbor as yourself. (ESV)
#+END_QUOTE

The answer can be found in Matthew 22. When Jesus was asked what is the greatest commandment He replied, "You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind. This is the great and first commandment. And a second is like it: You shall love your neighbor as yourself" (Matthew 22:37–39; cf. Mark 12:28–34; Luke 10:25–37).

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *Mark 12:28-34* - And one of the scribes came up and heard them disputing with one another, and seeing that he answered them well, asked him, Which commandment is the most important of all? Jesus answered, The most important is, Hear, O Israel: The Lord our God, the Lord is one. And you shall love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind and with all your strength. The second is this: You shall love your neighbor as yourself. There is no other commandment greater than these. And the scribe said to him, You are right, Teacher. You have truly said that he is one, and there is no other besides him. And to love him with all the heart and with all the understanding and with all the strength, and to love one's neighbor as oneself, is much more than all whole burnt offerings and sacrifices. And when Jesus saw that he answered wisely, he said to him, You are not far from the kingdom of God. And after that no one dared to ask him any more questions. (ESV)
#+END_QUOTE

*Luke 10:25-37* - And behold, a lawyer stood up to put him to the test, saying, Teacher, what shall I do to inherit eternal life? He said to him, What is written in the Law? How do you read it? And he answered, You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your strength and with all your mind, and your neighbor as yourself. And he said to him, You have answered correctly; do this, and you will live. But he, desiring to justify himself, said to Jesus, And who is my neighbor? Jesus replied, A man was going down from Jerusalem to Jericho, and he fell among robbers, who stripped him and beat him and departed, leaving him half dead. Now by chance a priest was going down that road, and when he saw him he passed by on the other side. So likewise a Levite, when he came to the place and saw him, passed by on the other side. But a Samaritan, as he journeyed, came to where he was, and when he saw him, he had compassion. He went to him and bound up his wounds, pouring on oil and wine. Then he set him on his own animal and brought him to an inn and took care of him. And the next day he took out two denarii and gave them to the innkeeper, saying, Take care of him, and whatever more you spend, I will repay you when I come back. Which of these three, do you think, proved to be a neighbor to the man who fell among the robbers? He said, The one who showed him mercy. And Jesus said to him, You go, and do likewise. (ESV)

Out of all of the 600+ rules and regulations within the Mosaic law, why would Jesus point to only these two? The reason is found in the next verse; "On these two commandments depend all the Law and the Prophets" (Matthew 22:40). In other words, every law, and everything that the prophets wrote about, depends on loving God and loving mankind. This is "the Law"—to love.

But now we are released from the law, having died to that which held us captive, so that we serve not under the old written code but in the new life of the Spirit. What then shall we say? That the law is sin? By no means! Yet if it had not been for the law, I would not have known sin. I would not have known what it is to covet if the law had not said, You shall not covet. But sin, seizing an opportunity through the commandment, produced in me all kinds of covetousness. Apart from the law, sin lies dead. I was once alive apart from the law, but when the commandment came, sin came alive and I died. The very commandment that promised life proved to be death to me.

What does this mean?

* Nazarenes
In the 4th century, Jerome also refers to Nazarenes as those "who accept
Messiah in such a way that they do not cease to observe the old Law." In his
Epistle 75, to Augustine, he said:

What shall I say of the Ebionites who pretend to be Christians? To-day there
still exists among the Jews in all the synagogues of the East a heresy which
is called that of the Minæans, and which is still condemned by the Pharisees;
[its followers] are ordinarily called 'Nasarenes'; they believe that Christ,
the son of God, was born of the Virgin Mary, and they hold him to be the one
who suffered under Pontius Pilate and ascended to heaven, and in whom we also
believe. But while they pretend to be both Jews and Christians, they are
neither.

** Nazarene beliefs
The beliefs of the Nazarene sect or sects are described through various church fathers and heresiologists.

in Jesus as Messiah:

The Nazarenes... accept Messiah in such a way that they do not cease to observe the old Law.
— Jerome, On. Is. 8:14

in the Virgin Birth:

They believe that the Messiah was born of the Virgin Mary.
— Jerome, Letter 75 Jerome to Augustine

Adhering to circumcision and the Law of Moses:

They disagree with Jews because they have come to faith in Christ; but since they are still fettered by the Law – circumcision, the Sabbath, and the rest – they are not in accord with the Christians.
— Epiphanius of Salamis, Panarion 29.7.4

Use of Old Testament and New Testament:

They use not only the New Testament but the Old Testament as well, as the Jews do.
— Epiphanius of Salamis, Panarion 29.7.2

Use of Hebrew and Aramaic New Testament source texts:

They have the Gospel according to Matthew in its entirety in Hebrew. For it is clear that they still preserve this, in the Hebrew alphabet, as it was originally written.
— Epiphanius of Salamis, Panarion 29.9.4

And he Hegesippus the Nazarene quotes some passages from the Gospel according to the Hebrews and from the Syriac [the Aramaic], and some particulars from the Hebrew tongue, showing that he was a convert from the Hebrews, and he mentions other matters as taken from the oral tradition of the Jews.
— Eusebius, Church History 4.22

“To the one who wishes to successfully oppose
heresy, it is necessary to completely set
aside vanity and hostility towards others,
lest it be expressed through mockery or harsh
words, or through some brilliant discourse
that may impress the proud soul of the heretic
and stir up passions within it.

Heal the wound of your neighbor solely with
words of love and humility, like healing balm,
so that the merciful Lord may look upon your
love and humility, so that they may be
revealed to the heart of your neighbor, and so
that you may be bestowed with the great gift
of God - the salvation of your neighbor.

The pride, insolence, stubbornness, and zeal
of heretics only have the appearance of
energy, but in essence, they are weakness,
which requires prudent compassion.

This weakness only becomes stronger and more
pronounced when faced with indiscriminate
zeal, expressed through harsh exposures.”

  Ro 6:2: By no means! How can we who died to sin still live in it?
  Ro 6:3: Do you not know that all of us who have been baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into his death?
  Ro 6:4: We were buried therefore with him by baptism into death, in order that, just as Christ was raised from the dead by the glory of the Father, we too might walk in newness of life.
  Ro 6:5: For if we have been united with him in a death like his, we shall certainly be united with him in a resurrection like his.
  Ro 6:6: We know that our old self was crucified with him in order that the body of sin might be brought to nothing, so that we would no longer be enslaved to sin.
  Ro 6:7: For one who has died has been set free from sin.
  Ro 6:8: Now if we have died with Christ, we believe that we will also live with him.
  Ro 6:9: We know that Christ being raised from the dead will never die again; death no longer has dominion over him.
  Ro 6:10: For the death he died he died to sin, once for all, but the life he lives he lives to God.
  Ro 6:11: So you also must consider yourselves dead to sin and alive to God in Christ Jesus.
  Ro 6:12: Let not sin therefore reign in your mortal bodies, to make you obey their passions.
  Ro 6:13: Do not present your members to sin as instruments for unrighteousness, but present yourselves to God as those who have been brought from death to life, and your members to God as instruments for righteousness.
  Ro 6:14: For sin will have no dominion over you, since you are not under law but under grace.

#+END_QUOTE

We are sanctified by faith in Jesus Christ.

We must be turned from darkness to light and from the power of satan to God.

Forgiveness of sins is received by those who have been turned from darkness to light,
and Jesus Christ sanctifies them.

Holiness is not achieved by keeping any set of rules - doing that is called legalism.
Holiness is achieved by faith in Jesus Christ.

Submit to the righteous government of God in the Person of Jesus Christ.

What doesn't submit?
- The old man / the body of sin / the body of the flesh / the nature we inherited with our physical bodies

Through faith in Jesus and His sacrificial death on our behalf, we can have forgiveness for our past sin.

The first stage in salvation is having our past sins forgiven.
The second part of the remedy is dealing with the rebel - and until he is dealt with, a person will never be a stable, successful, fruitful Christian.
God's solution for the rebel is very simple and very radical: God does not send the rebel to church and to memorize scripture.
God's solution is to execute the rebel.

The Good News is the execution happened some 19 centuries ago, when Jesus died on the cross:

The rebel in every one of us was put to death when Jesus was crucified.

The body of sin is the old rebellious nature.
Until the rebel is dealt with you'll continue to be a slave of sin.
Only the program of God that deals with the rebel can deliver you from the slavery of sin.

Knowing and believing it can radically change you.
The fact can change you.

Pray for clarity and understanding.

- Ready my heart
- Jesus came born as a virgin, walked the earth
- Be set free to live for Jesus
- Leave this world behind and don't look back
- Sacrifice for Jesus
- Jesus died so that I would awaken hearts, know wrong from right and know the truth, not the truth of this world
- Pick up Jesus' words
- Meditate on Jesus' words that they would resonate in my soul and heart
- Be set free from the worldly ways that pull us away from Jesus
- Follow Jesus to the ends of the earth. Jesus' own know His voice and they follow Him. Another's voice they will not follow
- Know Jesus' heart and His ways
- Want what Jesus gives; Peace, love and joy - gifts out of this world
- Pick up our daily cross. Leave Jesus our burdens - they are not for us to carry
- Follow Jesus
- Be set free
- We are not from this world but from a Kingdom
- Be Kingdom-minded. We are the head and not the tail, above and not beneath
- Walk in Jesus' will
- Speak Jesus' truth

Yeshua, the True Messiah.

2 Peter 2:9-16
‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾
then the Lord knows how to rescue the godly
from trials, and to keep the unrighteous under
punishment until the day of judgment, and
especially those who indulge in the lust of
defiling passion and despise authority.

Bold and willful, they do not tremble as they
blaspheme the glorious ones, whereas angels,
though greater in might and power, do not
pronounce a blasphemous judgment against them
before the Lord.

But these, like irrational animals, creatures
of instinct, born to be caught and destroyed,
blaspheming about matters of which they are
ignorant, will also be destroyed in their
destruction, suffering wrong as the wage for
their wrongdoing.

They count it pleasure to revel in the
daytime.

They are blots and blemishes, reveling in
their deceptions, while they feast with you.

They have eyes full of adultery, insatiable
for sin.

They entice unsteady souls.

They have hearts trained in greed.

Accursed children! Forsaking the right way,
they have gone astray.

They have followed the way of Balaam, the son
of Beor, who loved gain from wrongdoing, but
was rebuked for his own transgression; a
speechless donkey spoke with human voice and
restrained the prophet's madness.

  *Colossians 3:5-10* - Put to death therefore what is earthly in you: sexual immorality, impurity, passion, evil desire, and covetousness, which is idolatry. On account of these the wrath of God is coming. In these you too once walked, when you were living in them. But now you must put them all away: anger, wrath, malice, slander, and obscene talk from your mouth. Do not lie to one another, seeing that you have put off the old self with its practices and have put on the new self, which is being renewed in knowledge after the image of its creator.

I conjecture that the first, in God's sight, is proving their faith to Him and the second may be simply stating what they believe is true
about the bondage of the will perhaps from experience or observation
without being hostile to God, as they still are willing to do the will of God.

  *Ga 5:16-26* - But I say, walk by the Spirit, and you will not gratify the desires of the flesh.  For the desires of the flesh are against the Spirit, and the desires of the Spirit are against the flesh, for these are opposed to each other, to keep you from doing the things you want to do.  But if you are led by the Spirit, you are not under the law.  Now the works of the flesh are evident: sexual immorality, impurity, sensuality, idolatry, sorcery, enmity, strife, jealousy, fits of anger, rivalries, dissensions, divisions, envy, drunkenness, orgies, and things like these. I warn you, as I warned you before, that those who do such things will not inherit the kingdom of God.  But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, self-control; against such things there is no law.  And those who belong to Christ Jesus have crucified the flesh with its passions and desires.  If we live by the Spirit, let us also walk by the Spirit.  Let us not become conceited, provoking one another, envying one another.

- Firstly, get good at building the game in order to arrive at mastery over the game media
- Allow the gamer to mod the game

- visual animations are important for making games, I think - it keeps things feeling as though anything is possible
- it should be possible to play against another player, in competition
- it should be possible to play with another player, in cooperation


- Randomize the locations of the ASCII decals

https://youtu.be/cydjH7qr8cE?t=719

We are righteous because of what Jesus did.
We come back into agreement with the law of God.

Bear fruit in keeping with repentance.

We have to change our mind about our way and come back into God's way.

We're constantly reminded about what God has done on the cross.

We arrive at agreement with God's law.

If we haven't arrived at agreeing with following Jesus, then we haven't arrived.

I think we are permanently saved when we are following Jesus.

We are saved from dying by Jesus giving us His Spirit and then,
so long as we take Jesus' yoke, we will live forever.

In the Kingdom of Heaven everyone is Baptised.
The Kingdom of Heaven has 10 virgins: 5 wis and 5 unwise.

In the Kingdom of God, all are the grain of wheet; no tares.
In the Kingdom of God, all are saints.

In the Kingdom of Heaven, there are sinners.

I do agree about how Christians need to follow Jesus.

* What's interesting is
I was already born of the spirit, and when the person prashant turned up
he said he wanted to turn me into an angel.
That's odd because there is nothing wrong with me simply remaining here in the kingdom, born of the spirit.
And I had to remain loyal to Jesus the entire time of course.
Also, I felt as though I was being propped up while I didn't understand what was going on.
What's not done in faith is sin, and I was having bad dreams.
It was certainly a time which I can't fully explain.

* Characteristics of a servant
[[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOBDRjbwwjo][Characteristics Of A Servant  | Bishop Mari Emmanuel | Part 1 - YouTube]]

** Love of God
How should we live as servants of the Lord Jesus?

We should truly serve Jesus Christ, our Lord, in accordance with How God has
instructed us to love Him and one another; we should be immitators of Christ.

I should speak the truth about God.

Love of God is the most important characteristic of a servant.

- Seeking to love God more
- Seeking to know God more, and more and more

This is not to say that a servant needs to attain a level of knowledge before
we can be a servant.

#+END_QUOTE

Need to be focused on heaven, not this vanity of all vanities: this world.

We need to have the love of God.

God must be first in my life, before anyone or anything else.

The term "samurai" comes from the Japanese word saburau, meaning "to serve,"

administrators and, later, armed imperial guards. Their title was mostly
metaphorical, referring to their loyalty to the emperor.

Now among those who went up to worship at the
feast were some Greeks.

So these came to Philip, who was from
Bethsaida in Galilee, and asked him, Sir, we
wish to see Jesus.

Philip went and told Andrew; Andrew and Philip
went and told Jesus.

And Jesus answered them, The hour has come for
the Son of Man to be glorified.

Truly, truly, I say to you, unless a grain of
wheat falls into the earth and dies, it
remains alone; but if it dies, it bears much
fruit.

Whoever loves his life loses it, and whoever
hates his life in this world will keep it for
eternal life.

If anyone serves me, he must follow me; and
where I am, there will my servant be also.

If anyone serves me, the Father will honor
him.

* I must continue having hope in Jesus
- I have hope to see Him one day.
- I believe He will save me even from this world.

I am waiting for Him.

* I just need to continue trusting in Jesus

* God help me

* I think it's possible to be extreme in either direction of
- Salvation through belief in Jesus
- Salvation through serving Jesus

But I think someone who has only belief must repent and also have an obedient heart.
And I think someone who has only service must repent and also have a believing heart.

* AMEN!!
God, You HAVE made me happy in You!!
Praise You, God!
Thank You so much, God!
ALL glory to You Jesus and to You, Father God!
Hallelujah!
I love You, God!

AMEN!!

* I must not be conformed to the passions of my former ignorance

I want to:
- Put all sexual sin to death
- Not go back to selfishness

* God's Word creates reality
When God speaks, creation conforms to it.

* I believe that both actions and words are important
Because like begets like.

* Father God please heal me
Please save me, Jesus.

* God help me

* With regards to my own testimony, it was probably the devil who threw me into that court situation
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *Revelation of John 2:10* - Do not fear what you are about to suffer. Behold, the devil is about to throw some of you into prison, that you may be tested, and for ten days you will have tribulation. Be faithful unto death, and I will give you the crown of life.

** We have to resist the devil

James 4:7: Submit yourselves therefore to God. Resist the devil, and he will flee from you.
I Peter 5:8: Be sober-minded; be watchful. Your adversary the devil prowls around like a roaring lion, seeking someone to devour.
I John 3:8: Whoever makes a practice of sinning is of the devil, for the devil has been sinning from the beginning. The reason the Son of God appeared was to destroy the works of the devil.
I John 3:10: By this it is evident who are the children of God, and who are the children of the devil: whoever does not practice righteousness is not of God, nor is the one who does not love his brother.

* 

*John 6:66* - After this many of his disciples turned back and no longer walked with him. (ESV)

*Luke 9:62* - Jesus said to him, No one who puts his hand to the plow and looks back is fit for the kingdom of God. (ESV)

*I John 2:19* - They went out from us, but they were not of us; for if they had been of us, they would have continued with us. But they went out, that it might become plain that they all are not of us. (ESV)

*John 6:60* - When many of his disciples heard it, they said, This is a hard saying; who can listen to it? (ESV)

** Faith is something to be lived out
Living by faith involves not shrinking back:

*Hebrews 10:36-39* - For you have need of endurance, so that when you have done the will of God you may receive what is promised. For, Yet a little while, and the coming one will come and will not delay; but my righteous one shall live by faith, and if he shrinks back, my soul has no pleasure in him. But we are not of those who shrink back and are destroyed, but of those who have faith and preserve their souls.

Paul the Apostle didn't believe in shrinking back:

*II Timothy 4:10* - For Demas, in love with this present world, has deserted me and gone to Thessalonica. Crescens has gone to Galatia, Titus to Dalmatia. (ESV)

*John 8:31* - So Jesus said to the Jews who had believed in him, If you abide in my word, you are truly my disciples, (ESV)

*Matthew 19:22-23* - When the young man heard this he went away sorrowful, for he had great possessions. And Jesus said to his disciples, Truly, I say to you, only with difficulty will a rich person enter the kingdom of heaven. (ESV)

*II Timothy 1:12-15* - which is why I suffer as I do. But I am not ashamed, for I know whom I have believed, and I am convinced that he is able to guard until that Day what has been entrusted to me. Follow the pattern of the sound words that you have heard from me, in the faith and love that are in Christ Jesus. By the Holy Spirit who dwells within us, guard the good deposit entrusted to you. You are aware that all who are in Asia turned away from me, among whom are Phygelus and Hermogenes. (ESV)

* Jesus' Father is in Heaven
AMEN!!

* Some people believe all these things happen simultaneously, but I think they are wrong about that
** What happens immediately?

** 
So the following says that the faithful disciples came from belief to knowing who Jesus is and don't want to give up following Him. And it also says some of Jesus' disciples no longer walked with him - John 6:66:

John 6:64: But there are some of you who do not believe. (For Jesus knew from the beginning who those were who did not believe, and who it was who would betray him. )
John 6:65: And he said, This is why I told you that no one can come to me unless it is granted him by the Father.
John 6:66: After this many of his disciples turned back and no longer walked with him.
John 6:67: So Jesus said to the Twelve, Do you want to go away as well?
John 6:68: Simon Peter answered him, Lord, to whom shall we go? You have the words of eternal life,
John 6:69: and we have believed, and have come to know, that you are the Holy One of God.

Ephesians 1:13: In him you also, when you heard the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation, and believed in him, were sealed with the promised Holy Spirit,
Ephesians 1:14: who is the guarantee of our inheritance until we acquire possession of it, to the praise of his glory.

I Corinthians 12:13: For in one Spirit we were all baptized into one body—Jews or Greeks, slaves or free—and all were made to drink of one Spirit.

John 10:27: My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me.
John 10:28: I give them eternal life, and they will never perish, and no one will snatch them out of my hand.
John 10:29: My Father, who has given them to me, is greater than all, and no one is able to snatch them out of the Father's hand.
John 10:30: I and the Father are one.
John 10:31: The Jews picked up stones again to stone him.

* Just continue reading the Bible for what it says

* God please help me
*James 1:21-22* - Therefore put away all filthiness and rampant wickedness and receive with meekness the implanted word, which is able to save your souls. But be doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving yourselves. (ESV)

I'm not going to feel condemned though for what I'm going through.

I believe it's mostly physiological.

But there is also something spiritually wicked about what has been happening:
- the invasion of my dreams
- the invasion of my dreams

* The Deepest Teaching On Faith I've Ever Done | Lordship Salvation vs. Free Grace Theology (Ep. 1)
Honestly, I feel like the Free Grace Theology stuff actually results strongly
in lots of people who are not disciples of Jesus.

But perhaps they actually come under the banner of a disciple of Jesus.

* Interesting: I had no idea about this
[[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbpYsS79OO4][The Deepest Teaching On Faith I've Ever Done  | Lordship Salvation vs. Free Grace Theology {Ep. 1} - YouTube]]

* I like this song title
[[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z7oCa9BvO9g&list=RDz7oCa9BvO9g&start_radio=1&rv=o5JPGD1k0rM][Keith Green 1978 : Make My Life A Prayer to You {live} - YouTube]]

One of the things that I really like is:
- My whole life should be a prayer to Jesus

* I don't know what to think anymore
I don't know really what is going on with me.
I don't know why this has happened to me.

* Keep in mind that I have seen personality changes from other people as I write and learn about my theology
I'm in the spiritual realm now.

Therefore, I should be on the defense regarding my theology and not allow the enemy to trick me.

* I consider myself neither to be an Arminian theologian nor a Calvinist
I have read the Bible for myself.

* The reformed church has been quite loving actually
Jesus is quite loving.
I'm sure He has a lot of grace.

But I don't like bad doctrine that makes grace seem cheap.

* I'm quite unsure why this has happened to me regarding the entire situation with Chen, Prashant, Matt, my Dad, Melee, her birthday

It's been incredibly chaotic.

I don't understand why this has happened to be honest.

I don't understand it.

It does actually seem quite unfair to be honest, and I feel as though my life has really been messed around with.

* I think that I had been under some strange spiritual attack where people have been asking my opinion on various denominations
I don't want to condemn anyone.

* I should focus on my programming so that I distract myself from spiritual attack, and distract myself from doing any masturbation etc.
The programming was actually quite good for avoiding that stuff.

* Have an idle timer for the universal sidecar update

* I don't really want to touch much else from other pastors right now
I just want to remain faithful to Jesus in truth.

* The free grace I believe is received through faith
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_grace_theology

The free grace I believe is received through faith. Thus it only results in people who are obedient to the gospel being sons and daughers of God.

* No-one has sent me any mail since around 20 Feb
That's been a while.
Comforting, though.

I think that God is silencing everyone around me perhaps.
I'm not sure what's going on, really.
I just want to be faithful to Jesus.

Father God, please do not let me be destroyed.
I just want to help.

* I think Calvinism vs Arminianism is not worth thinking about
I should just remain wise and innocent.
I should simply read my Bible and not care too much about other people's theories.

Perhaps it's time to bridle my tongue now and continue putting serving Jesus into practice.

Yes, this is what I should be doing.

* I think there's nothing really wrong with reading the Bible for myself and coming to conclusions that are not defiled by Christian philosophy

* Think about this
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_grace_theology

Discipleship salvation vs free grace salvation.

It's interesting.

I think that I believe there is grace for people who:
- have faith

* 
Jesus is the Word.

* I love You, Jesus
Please don't let me fall.

* We must look upon Jesus and stop sexual immorality and stop idolatry
*I Corinthians 10:1-7* - I want you to know, brothers, that our fathers were all under the cloud, and all passed through the sea, and all were baptized into Moses in the cloud and in the sea, and all ate the same spiritual food, and all drank the same spiritual drink. For they drank from the spiritual Rock that followed them, and the Rock was Christ. Nevertheless, with most of them God was not pleased, for they were overthrown in the wilderness. Now these things took place as examples for us, that we might not desire evil as they did. Do not be idolaters as some of them were; as it is written, The people sat down to eat and drink and rose up to play.

*I Corinthians 10:8-13*- We must not indulge in sexual immorality as some of them did, and twenty-three thousand fell in a single day. We must not put Christ to the test, as some of them did and were destroyed by serpents, nor grumble, as some of them did and were destroyed by the Destroyer. Now these things happened to them as an example, but they were written down for our instruction, on whom the end of the ages has come. Therefore let anyone who thinks that he stands take heed lest he fall. No temptation has overtaken you that is not common to man. God is faithful, and he will not let you be tempted beyond your ability, but with the temptation he will also provide the way of escape, that you may be able to endure it.

* We must love the glory that comes from God

*John 12:42-50* - Nevertheless, many even of the authorities believed in him, but for fear of the Pharisees they did not confess it, so that they would not be put out of the synagogue; for they loved the glory that comes from man more than the glory that comes from God.  And Jesus cried out and said, Whoever believes in me, believes not in me but in him who sent me.  And whoever sees me sees him who sent me.  I have come into the world as light, so that whoever believes in me may not remain in darkness.  If anyone hears my words and does not keep them, I do not judge him; for I did not come to judge the world but to save the world.  The one who rejects me and does not receive my words has a judge; the word that I have spoken will judge him on the last day.  For I have not spoken on my own authority, but the Father who sent me has himself given me a commandment—what to say and what to speak.  And I know that his commandment is eternal life. What I say, therefore, I say as the Father has told me.

* My mother and brothers are those that hear the word of God and do it

* I believe that I should try as hard as I can to enter via the narrow gate
** Narrow is the gate and hard is the way that leads to life
*Matthew 7:13* - Enter by the narrow gate. For the gate is wide and the way is easy that leads to destruction, and those who enter by it are many.

*Matthew 7:14* - For the gate is narrow and the way is hard that leads to life, and those who find it are few.

*Luke 13:24* - Strive to enter through the narrow door. For many, I tell you, will seek to enter and will not be able.

** Obedience
*Ezekiel 33:31* - And they come to you as people come, and they sit before you as my people, and they hear what you say but they will not do it; for with lustful talk in their mouths they act; their heart is set on their gain. (ESV)

** The way is easy that leads to destruction
*Matthew 7:13* - Enter by the narrow gate. For the gate is wide and the way is easy that leads to destruction, and those who enter by it are many.

** Narrow gate
*II Peter 1:10* - Therefore, brothers, be all the more diligent to make your calling and election sure, for if you practice these qualities you will never fall. (ESV)
*Hebrews 4:11* - Let us therefore strive to enter that rest, so that no one may fall by the same sort of disobedience. (ESV)
*I Corinthians 9:24-27* - Do you not know that in a race all the runners compete, but only one receives the prize? So run that you may obtain it. Every athlete exercises self-control in all things. They do it to receive a perishable wreath, but we an imperishable. So I do not run aimlessly; I do not box as one beating the air. But I discipline my body and keep it under control, lest after preaching to others I myself should be disqualified. (ESV)
*Philippians 2:12-13* - Therefore, my beloved, as you have always obeyed, so now, not only as in my presence but much more in my absence, work out your own salvation with fear and trembling, for it is God who works in you, both to will and to work for his good pleasure. (ESV)

** Submit to God's righteousness
 *Romans 10:3* - For, being ignorant of the righteousness that comes from God, and seeking to establish their own, they did not submit to God's righteousness. (ESV)

** We must do the will of God, which is the food and drink which Jesus gives us
*John 6:27* - Do not labor for the food that perishes, but for the food that endures to eternal life, which the Son of Man will give to you. For on him God the Father has set his seal. (ESV)

*John 7:34-39* - You will seek me and you will not find me. Where I am you cannot come. (ESV) The Jews said to one another, Where does this man intend to go that we will not find him? Does he intend to go to the Dispersion among the Greeks and teach the Greeks?  What does he mean by saying, You will seek me and you will not find me, and, Where I am you cannot come?  On the last day of the feast, the great day, Jesus stood up and cried out, If anyone thirsts, let him come to me and drink.  Whoever believes in me, as the Scripture has said, Out of his heart will flow rivers of living water.  Now this he said about the Spirit, whom those who believed in him were to receive, for as yet the Spirit had not been given, because Jesus was not yet glorified.

* Interesting
*John 2:1-4* - On the third day there was a wedding at Cana in Galilee, and the mother of Jesus was there. Jesus also was invited to the wedding with his disciples. When the wine ran out, the mother of Jesus said to him, They have no wine. And Jesus said to her, Woman, what does this have to do with me? My hour has not yet come.

* Gospel
*Galatians 3:8* - And the Scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the Gentiles by faith, preached the gospel beforehand to Abraham, saying, In you shall all the nations be blessed. (ESV)

*Genesis 12:3* - I will bless those who bless you, and him who dishonors you I will curse, and in you all the families of the earth shall be blessed. (ESV)

I should be curating this type of music, etc. and selecting what I want to play.

* I don't know what's going on regarding all of these strange 'conversations' in my dreams which I think are demons
I rebuke them in Jesus Christ's name.

* I don't understand why
- I've been excluded from the various churches
  - Shibu
  - Cornerstone

I'm finding it very hard to adjust, even into a job when such things are being excluded.
I rebuke the persecution in Jesus' name.

I want all doors to open for me.
Because all doors seem to be closed.
It's because all doors seem to be closed that I want all doors to be opened.
Because each time I try any step of faith in the right direction, a door closes from so-called Christians.
This is the problem.
The problem is I am continually being blocked and barred.

Bring out with you every living thing that is

* Keep in mind that they may be totally caught in sin

* Under the present circumstances, I could never marry Melee
God needs to intervene.

* Is the kingdom spouse stuff a deception? It might be.
It's certainly a distraction.

* I think I should probably try even harder to put a stop to the masturbation stuff

* I do not understand what was deemed wrong about making a marriage proposal to Melee
- Why does dad say it was wrong?

* 
I disagree that 'acts of mercy' cannot be counted as faith when a person may be obedient to Jesus.

* I should actually try quite hard to defeat this masturbation stuff
Think of it as an addiction similar to vaping.
Therefore, I need to detox from it, and go cold turkey.

What could be some good distractions?
Building Pen.el is a good one.

* I have cold feet regarding Melee
A big reason is that I do not like the bad stuff.
I think it's best if I continue to repent and be sanctified to holiness.
But I rebuke in Jesus Christ's name the anti-relationship spirit.
I rebuke it in Jesus Christ's name.

* I must do my best to simply resist masturbation, etc.

* Parts of the gospel of phillip seem to contain some things which sond right, but it's mixed with things that sound false - I don't consider it to be canon
    He who has knowledge of the truth is a free man,
    but the free man does not sin, for "He who sins
    is the slave of sin" (Jn 8:34). Truth is the
    mother, knowledge the father. Those who think
    that sinning does not apply to them are called
    "free" by the world. Knowledge of the truth
    merely makes such people arrogant, which is what
    the words, "it makes them free" mean. It even
    gives them a sense of superiority over the whole
    world. But "Love builds up" (1 Co 8:1). In fact,
    he who is really free, through knowledge, is a
    slave, because of love for those who have not
    yet been able to attain to the freedom of
    knowledge. Knowledge makes them capable of
    becoming free. Love never calls something its
    own, [...] it [...] possess [...]. It never
    says,"This is yours" or "This is mine," but "All
    these are yours". Spiritual love is wine and
    fragrance. All those who anoint themselves with
    it take pleasure in it. While those who are
    anointed are present, those nearby also profit
    (from the fragrance). If those anointed with
    ointment withdraw from them and leave, then
    those not anointed, who merely stand nearby,
    still remain in their bad odor. The Samaritan
    gave nothing but wine and oil to the wounded
    man. It is nothing other than the ointment. It
    healed the wounds, for "love covers a multitude
    of sins" (1 P 4:8).

* I mean, I still love Melee
If it *were* ever possible (God approved and it was His will), I would marry her.

* 
Hallelujah is awesome!

- Come back to God as your first love.
- For some people, God lets them just go out and choose a partner.
- But when God has assigned a Kingdom partner, it's likely that they will come under spiritual attack to derail it
  - Because they are assigned a job

** Erasmum and synergism

Erasmus argued against the belief that God's foreknowledge of events caused
those events, and he held that the doctrines of repentance, baptism, and
conversion depended on the existence of free will. He likewise contended that
divine grace first called, led, and assisted humans in coming to the knowledge
of God, and then supported them as they then used their free will to make
choices between good and evil, and enabled them to act on their choices for
repentance and good, which in turn could lead to salvation through the
atonement of Jesus Christ (Synergism).

Therefore, we are ambassadors for Christ, God making his appeal through us. We implore you on behalf of Christ, be reconciled to God.

We must receive Jesus' words, walk in them and come to *know in truth* (we must truly know) that Jesus came from God.

*John 17:8* - For I have given them the words that you gave me, and they have received them and have come to know in truth that I came from you; and they have believed that you sent me.

* When I ask God for things, I must not doubt. I must have faith
*James 1:1-5* - James, a bond-servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ, To the twelve tribes who are dispersed abroad: Greetings.  Consider it all joy, my brethren, when you encounter various trials, knowing that the testing of your faith produces endurance.  And let endurance have its perfect result, so that you may be perfect and complete, lacking in nothing.  But if any of you lacks wisdom, let him ask of God, who gives to all generously and without reproach, and it will be given to him.

The one who does not doubt is unwavering and is not tossed around by the sea.
Therefore, it's an ongoing thing.

*James 1:6* - But he must ask in faith (G4102 *pistis*) without any doubting (G1252 *diakrino*), for the one who doubts (G1252 diakrino) is like the surf of the sea, driven and tossed by the wind.

* Submit to one another out of reverance for Christ Jesus
*Ephesians 5:20-22* giving thanks always and for everything to God the Father in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, submitting to one another out of reverence for Christ.  Wives, submit to your own husbands, as to the Lord.

*Ephesians 6:5-9* - Slaves, obey your earthly masters with fear and trembling, with a sincere heart, as you would Christ, not by the way of eye-service, as people-pleasers, but as servants of Christ, doing the will of God from the heart, rendering service with a good will as to the Lord and not to man, knowing that whatever good anyone does, this he will receive back from the Lord, whether he is a slave or free.

Also, I think that considering I am commanded to love one another as He has loved me,
therefore it is extremely important that I do not compromise regarding the commandment to love my neighbour.
The best thing I can do right now is go my separate ways from Melee.

  Faith-in-God when tested by God is found to be true Faith in God.
  Faith-in-God must submit to the Righteousnes of God through faith in Jesus Christ,

  Faith has 'substance/magnitude' and may be described as a vector:
  - The origin of hope/belief is represented by the point.
    - On the Faith plane, positive magnitude comes from trust in God
  - Hope-from/in-God is the direction.
  - Work/Love is the magnitude.

  Faith in the wrong thing:
  - On the Faithless plane, positive magnitude comes from trust in something else, i.e. money or self

  Justifying faith vs justifying works is misunderstood and is a false dichotomy
  Because someone has bundled 'trusting
  action/seeking God in action' along with
  'obedience' into works when it belongs inside
  faith.

  - Obedience belongs inside faith because
    - God commanded it and complying is not really bringing anything
      to God which He hasn't told you to bring to Him.
      - So it's just acting in faith
      - If God commands you to wait a week before going into battle, is that considered work? No, it's faith.
    - Choosing to obey God's commandments even when no-one is watching (aside from God) is having faith in God.
      - Therefore, there is a way of abiding by God's commandments which is faith and not works.
  - Seeking God in action belongs in faith because
    - When someone wills to seek God, they act.
    - And *Hebrews 11:6* declares that faith is implied when someone believes God exists and rewards those who seek Him.
      - And *Hebrews 11:6* declares that God rewards those who seek Him.

If I'm pressured into accepting the exchange of the grace of God for
some worldly deliverance from suffering, without any obedience to Jesus required,
and I notice what's happening and I do not have faith to proceed with it, then have I sinned by
not embracing the exchange?
Well, if I would have gone along with it without any loyalty to Jesus, knowing full well
that it did not sit right with me in my conscience, then I would have acted out of faith.

* Yes, I believe that salvation is a gift
- I believe that faith is given/imparted to us.
  - Jesus is the author of our faith

*James 2:22-26* - You see that faith was active along with his works, and faith was completed by his works; and the Scripture was fulfilled that says, Abraham believed God, and it was counted to him as righteousness—and he was called a friend of God. You see that a person is justified by works and not by faith alone. And in the same way was not also Rahab the prostitute justified by works when she received the messengers and sent them out by another way? For as the body apart from the spirit is dead, so also faith apart from works is dead. (ESV)

*James 2:26* - For as the body apart from the spirit is dead, so also faith apart from works is dead.

*Romans 3:28-31* - For we hold that one is justified by faith apart from works of the law. Or is God the God of Jews only? Is he not the God of Gentiles also? Yes, of Gentiles also, since God is one. He will justify the circumcised by faith and the uncircumcised through faith. Do we then overthrow the law by this faith? By no means! On the contrary, we uphold the law. (ESV)

The guy at Corrections said, "Apart from the body the spirit is dead."

I disagree with it.

* Faith
One must have faith to receive the gift of salvation.

** The faith itself may be a gift, but certainly is cooperative
God spoke to Abraham first, and then Abraham believed God.

But God made the first move.
The first move from Abraham was belief.

The Lord God spoke first - this itself is a gift.

Faith involves:
- Obedience
- Loyalty (faithfulness to God)
- God rewarded Abram with a promise
- Abram believed God
- God counted Abram's belief as righteousness

*Genesis 12:1* - Now the Lord said to Abram, Go from your country and your kindred and your father's house to the land that I will show you.

Abraham *obeyed* God.

*Genesis 12:4* - So Abram went, as the Lord had told him, and Lot went with him. Abram was seventy-five years old when he departed from Haran.

God promised him something, and gave Abram an instruction.

*Genesis 13:14* - The Lord said to Abram, after Lot had separated from him, Lift up your eyes and look from the place where you are, northward and southward and eastward and westward, for all the land that you see I will give to you and to your offspring forever.  I will make your offspring as the dust of the earth, so that if one can count the dust of the earth, your offspring also can be counted. Arise, walk through the length and the breadth of the land, for I will give it to you.

Abram obeyed.

*Genesis 13:18* - So Abram moved his tent and came and settled by the oaks of Mamre, which are at Hebron, and there he built an altar to the Lord.

Abram interacted with Melchizedek, priest of God Most High, blessed by God Most High.

*Genesis 14:18-20* - And Melchizedek king of Salem brought out bread and wine. (He was priest of God Most High. ) And he blessed him and said, Blessed be Abram by God Most High, Possessor of heaven and earth; and blessed be God Most High, who has delivered your enemies into your hand! And Abram gave him a tenth of everything.

Abram, in an act of faith with faithfulness, displayed loyalty to God.

*Genesis 14:21-24* - And the king of Sodom said to Abram, Give me the persons, but take the goods for yourself.  But Abram said to the king of Sodom, I have lifted my hand to the Lord, God Most High, Possessor of heaven and earth, that I would not take a thread or a sandal strap or anything that is yours, lest you should say, I have made Abram rich.  I will take nothing but what the young men have eaten, and the share of the men who went with me. Let Aner, Eshcol, and Mamre take their share.

God noticed and gave Abram a vision and made a promise to Abram, and Abram believed God and God counted it to Abram as righteousness.

*Genesis 15:1* - After these things the word of the Lord came to Abram in a vision: Fear not, Abram, I am your shield; your reward shall be very great.  But Abram said, O Lord God, what will you give me, for I continue childless, and the heir of my house is Eliezer of Damascus?  And Abram said, Behold, you have given me no offspring, and a member of my household will be my heir.  And behold, the word of the Lord came to him: This man shall not be your heir; your very own son shall be your heir.  And he brought him outside and said, Look toward heaven, and number the stars, if you are able to number them. Then he said to him, So shall your offspring be.  And he believed the Lord, and he counted it to him as righteousness.

** Genesis 15
This whole chapter explains an ongoing relationship between God and Abraham.

*Genesis 15:4-6* - And behold, the word of the Lord came to him: This man shall not be your heir; your very own son shall be your heir.  And he brought him outside and said, Look toward heaven, and number the stars, if you are able to number them. Then he said to him, So shall your offspring be.  And he believed the Lord, and he counted it to him as righteousness.

This was God speaking directly to Abraham and Abraham believing what God said and God reckoning that to Abraham as righteousness.
But keep in mind Abram had belief in God prior,

** Hearing the gospel of Jesus Christ - believing in Jesus Christ
- We have heard the gospel and when the gospel is believed, God counts that as righteousness.

So what measure of the gospel of Jesus Christ has a person heard? And what have they believed.
I think that matters. AMEN.

** Receiving (more?) from God
- Through a relationship / dialogue with God, involving the person.
- Maybe through trial and a work / an act of faith.

By faith the prophets wrote down God's words.
By faith we believe God's words.
By faith we receive the promises.

** Strong faith
- Believing God right away without questioning
- Remaining faithful
- Believing and holding that belief through challenges and trial

Do not be deceived: neither the sexually
immoral, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor
men who practice homosexuality, nor thieves,
nor the greedy, nor drunkards, nor revilers,
nor swindlers will inherit the kingdom of God.

And such were some of you.

But you were washed, you were sanctified, you
were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus
Christ and by the Spirit of our God.

All things are lawful for me, but not all
things are helpful.

All things are lawful for me, but I will not
be enslaved by anything.

Food is meant for the stomach and the stomach
for food—and God will destroy both one and the
other.

The body is not meant for sexual immorality,
but for the Lord, and the Lord for the body.

And God raised the Lord and will also raise us
up by his power.

Do you not know that your bodies are members
of Christ?

Shall I then take the members of Christ and
make them members of a prostitute?

Never! Or do you not know that he who is
joined to a prostitute becomes one body with
her?

For, as it is written, The two will become one
flesh.

But he who is joined to the Lord becomes one
spirit with him.

Flee from sexual immorality.

Every other sin a person commits is outside
the body, but the sexually immoral person sins
against his own body.

Or do you not know that your body is a temple
of the Holy Spirit within you, whom you have
from God?

You are not your own, for you were bought with
a price.

So glorify God in your body.

Without believing in Jesus Christ and receiving the Holy Spirit, the law can't do it on its own.

I ask, then, has God rejected his people?

By no means! For I myself am an Israelite, a
descendant of Abraham, a member of the tribe
of Benjamin.

God has not rejected his people whom he
foreknew.

Do you not know what the Scripture says of
Elijah, how he appeals to God against Israel?

Lord, they have killed your prophets, they
have demolished your altars, and I alone am
left, and they seek my life.

But what is God's reply to him?

I have kept for myself seven thousand men who
have not bowed the knee to Baal.

So too at the present time there is a remnant,
chosen by grace.

But if it is by grace, it is no longer on the
basis of works; otherwise grace would no
longer be grace.

What then?

Israel failed to obtain what it was seeking.

The elect obtained it, but the rest were
hardened, as it is written, God gave them a
spirit of stupor, eyes that would not see and
ears that would not hear, down to this very
day.

And David says, Let their table become a snare
and a trap, a stumbling block and a
retribution for them; let their eyes be
darkened so that they cannot see, and bend
their backs forever.

So I ask, did they stumble in order that they
might fall?

By no means! Rather through their trespass
salvation has come to the Gentiles, so as to
make Israel jealous.

Now if their trespass means riches for the
world, and if their failure means riches for
the Gentiles, how much more will their full
inclusion mean! Now I am speaking to you
Gentiles.

Inasmuch then as I am an apostle to the
Gentiles, I magnify my ministry in order
somehow to make my fellow Jews jealous, and
thus save some of them.

For if their rejection means the
reconciliation of the world, what will their
acceptance mean but life from the dead?

If the dough offered as firstfruits is holy,
so is the whole lump, and if the root is holy,
so are the branches.

But if some of the branches were broken off,
and you, although a wild olive shoot, were
grafted in among the others and now share in
the nourishing root of the olive tree, do not
be arrogant toward the branches.

If you are, remember it is not you who support
the root, but the root that supports you.

Then you will say, Branches were broken off so
that I might be grafted in.

That is true.

They were broken off because of their
unbelief, but you stand fast through faith.

So do not become proud, but stand in awe.

For if God did not spare the natural branches,
neither will he spare you.

Note then the kindness and the severity of
God: severity toward those who have fallen,
but God's kindness to you, provided you
continue in his kindness.

Otherwise you too will be cut off.

And even they, if they do not continue in
their unbelief, will be grafted in, for God
has the power to graft them in again.

For if you were cut from what is by nature a
wild olive tree, and grafted, contrary to
nature, into a cultivated olive tree, how much
more will these, the natural branches, be
grafted back into their own olive tree.

Lest you be wise in your own conceits, I want
you to understand this mystery, brothers: a
partial hardening has come upon Israel, until
the fullness of the Gentiles has come in.

And in this way all Israel will be saved, as
it is written, The Deliverer will come from
Zion, he will banish ungodliness from Jacob;
and this will be my covenant with them when I
take away their sins.

As regards the gospel, they are enemies of God
for your sake.

But as regards election, they are beloved for
the sake of their forefathers.

For the gifts and the calling of God are
irrevocable.

Just as you were at one time disobedient to
God but now have received mercy because of
their disobedience, so they too have now been
disobedient in order that by the mercy shown
to you they also may now receive mercy.

For God has consigned all to disobedience,
that he may have mercy on all.

Oh, the depth of the riches and wisdom and
knowledge of God! How unsearchable are his
judgments and how inscrutable his ways! For
who has known the mind of the Lord, or who has
been his counselor?

Or who has given a gift to him that he might
be repaid?

For from him and through him and to him are
all things.

To him be glory forever.

Amen.

But the promise of grace

** [[sh:tpop nem Romans 4:14-16]]
These verses show that the Mosaic law can be followed while simultaneously having faith - they are not mutually exclusive.

But faith is required to receive the promise of grace.
Someone who adheres to the Mosaic law, if they have faith too receive the grace.

Faith is more important to have.
In fact the promice of grace only goes to those who exercise Faith.

* [[bible:Matthew 12:7]]
If a person is *actually* allowing mercy/compassion then they would not have made the mistake of condemning someone who is innocent.

- For the letter kills but the spirit gives life
  - There is a way of abusing the law which accuses and tries to condemn the guiltless and the innocent
    - Adhering to the law instead of adhering to faith and grace
  - This doesn't mean the law is bad, but bringing it up is like weilding a sword

They didn't know that Jesus was the Son of Man and Lord of the Sabbath.
Jesus was actually abiding by the law.
And if the Pharisees were truly allowing mercy and compassion
then they wouldn't have condemned the innocent.
The Pharisees took the sword instead of being merciful, and then made the mistake
of accusing Jesus of breaking the law, but Jesus is the Son of Man and Lord of the Sabbath, but if they were being compassionate, they wouldn't have avoiding making that mistake.

* [[sh:tpop nem Matthew 12:5-21]]

** Following the law by faith is like this (I am considering this)
- You certainly don't bring up the law while simultaneously be unmerciful/uncompassionate
  - If you are follow the law properly then you are loving God and your neighbour
- Generally speaking, you don't always consult the law to see if you are allowed to do something - one must act and live in faith
- Most of the time you simply act in faith, and in truth with personal accountability to God
  - Trying to please God who sees
- You allow yourself to be corrected by the law, but not corrected away from loving God and your neighbour
  - The law does this, it shows our sin - every person is silenced by the law
  - And we do not adhere to the law as if we are under it, bringing every thought and action into subjection of the law because that will lead to condemning oneself.
    - That would be being under the Mosaic law
  - But rather, we yoke ourselves to the Spirit, and the Spirit helps us to keep the law in truth and reality, while living in freedom, and allowing the law to convict us.

*** Yet consider the pharisees tried to use the law to accuse Jesus, and they made a big mistake because Jesus is the Son of Man and Lord of the Sabbath. They wouldn't have made that mistake if they were showing mercy/compassion

** In truth and reality, accountable to God
Jesus followed and fulfilled the whole law but in faith.
He followed it, keeping accountability to God.

** Doing good is lawful, loving God and one's neighbour is lawful

For you have not come to a mountain that can
be touched and to a blazing fire, and to
darkness and gloom and whirlwind, and to the
blast of a trumpet and the sound of words
which sound was such that those who heard
begged that no further word be spoken to them.

For they could not bear the command, “If even
a beast touches the mountain, it will be
stoned.” And so terrible was the sight, that
Moses said, “I am full of fear and trembling.”
But you have come to Mount Zion and to the
city of the living God, the heavenly
Jerusalem, and to myriads of angels, to the
general assembly and church of the firstborn
who are enrolled in heaven, and to God, the
Judge of all, and to the spirits of the
righteous made perfect, and to Jesus, the
mediator of a new covenant, and to the
sprinkled blood, which speaks better than the
blood of Abel.

See to it that you do not refuse Him who is
speaking.

For if those did not escape when they refused
him who warned them on earth, much less will
we escape who turn away from Him who warns

Therefore if there is any encouragement in
Christ, if there is any consolation of love,
if there is any fellowship of the Spirit, if
any affection and compassion, make my joy
complete by being of the same mind,
maintaining the same love, united in spirit,
intent on one purpose.

Do nothing from selfishness or empty conceit,
but with humility of mind regard one another
as more important than yourselves; do not
merely look out for your own personal
interests, but also for the interests of
others.

Have this attitude in yourselves which was
also in Christ Jesus, who, although He existed
in the form of God, did not regard equality
with God a thing to be grasped, but emptied
Himself, taking the form of a bond-servant,
and being made in the likeness of men.

Being found in appearance as a man, He humbled
Himself by becoming obedient to the point of
death, even death on a cross.

At that time Jesus went through the
grainfields on the Sabbath, and His disciples
became hungry and began to pick the heads of
grain and eat.

But when the Pharisees saw this, they said to
Him, “Look, Your disciples do what is not
lawful to do on a Sabbath.” But He said to
them, “Have you not read what David did when
he became hungry, he and his companions, how
he entered the house of God, and they ate the
consecrated bread, which was not lawful for
him to eat nor for those with him, but for the
priests alone?

Or have you not read in the Law, that on the
Sabbath the priests in the temple break the
Sabbath and are innocent?

But I say to you that something greater than
the temple is here.

But if you had known what this means, ‘I
desire compassion, and not a sacrifice,’ you
would not have condemned the innocent.

For the Son of Man is Lord of the Sabbath.”

“I am the true vine, and My Father is the
vinedresser.

Every branch in Me that does not bear fruit,
He takes away; and every branch that bears
fruit, He prunes it so that it may bear more
fruit.

You are already clean because of the word
which I have spoken to you.

Abide in Me, and I in you.

As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself
unless it abides in the vine, so neither can
you unless you abide in Me.

I am the vine, you are the branches; he who
abides in Me and I in him, he bears much
fruit, for apart from Me you can do nothing.

If anyone does not abide in Me, he is thrown
away as a branch and dries up; and they gather
them, and cast them into the fire and they are
burned.

If you abide in Me, and My words abide in you,
ask whatever you wish, and it will be done for
you.

My Father is glorified by this, that you bear
much fruit, and so prove to be My disciples.

Just as the Father has loved Me, I have also
loved you; abide in My love.

If you keep My commandments, you will abide in
My love; just as I have kept My Father’s
commandments and abide in His love.

These things I have spoken to you so that My
joy may be in you, and that your joy may be
made full.

“This is My commandment, that you love one
another, just as I have loved you.

Greater love has no one than this, that one
lay down his life for his friends.

You are My friends if you do what I command
you.

No longer do I call you slaves, for the slave
does not know what his master is doing; but I
have called you friends, for all things that I
have heard from My Father I have made known to
you.

You did not choose Me but I chose you, and
appointed you that you would go and bear
fruit, and that your fruit would remain, so
that whatever you ask of the Father in My name
He may give to you.

This I command you, that you love one another.

“If the world hates you, you know that it has
hated Me before it hated you.

If you were of the world, the world would love
its own; but because you are not of the world,
but I chose you out of the world, because of
this the world hates you.

Remember the word that I said to you, ‘A slave
is not greater than his master.’ If they
persecuted Me, they will also persecute you;
if they kept My word, they will keep yours
also.

But all these things they will do to you for
My name’s sake, because they do not know the
One who sent Me.

If I had not come and spoken to them, they
would not have sin, but now they have no
excuse for their sin.

He who hates Me hates My Father also.

If I had not done among them the works which
no one else did, they would not have sin; but
now they have both seen and hated Me and My
Father as well.

But they have done this to fulfill the word
that is written in their Law, ‘They hated Me
without a cause.’ “When the Helper comes, whom
I will send to you from the Father, that is
the Spirit of truth who proceeds from the
Father, He will testify about Me, and you will
testify also, because you have been with Me
from the beginning.

* I am going to stick to simply learning from the Holy Scriptures right now as much as I can
I have found that as I have been speaking to other people around town, there has been some
deception in people I have spoken to. Indeed it feels like people have been trying to get me
to not believe in Jesus! How odd!
There has been quite a strong anti-christ spirit which has been opposing me, trying to get me to stray away from Jesus, but I am faithful to Jesus.

* Jesus' love-language is obedience / faithfulness

Jesus lived a perfect life. He did not sin.
He gave His life as a payment for our sins.
Our faith is counted as righteousness.

What does the Scripture say? "Abraham believed God, and it was credited to him
as righteousness." Now when a man works, his wages are not credited to him as a
gift, but as an obligation.

However, to the man who does not work but trusts God who justifies the wicked,
his faith is credited as righteousness.

** Paul's teachings are very interesting and I do understand that a person must be forgiven - but grace and forgiveness is a gift that the LORD gives

Now to the one who works, his wage is not
credited as a favor, but as what is due.

But to the one who does not work, but believes
in Him who justifies the ungodly, his faith is
credited as righteousness, just as David also
speaks of the blessing on the man to whom God
credits righteousness apart from works:
“Blessed are those whose lawless deeds have
been forgiven, And whose sins have been
covered.

“Blessed is the man whose sin the Lord will
not take into account.”

Father God, I understand that all my good works were preordained.
All my good works are merely gifts from You, LORD.

* I am going to stick to the Old Testament and New Testament for my understanding
e:/volumes/home/shane/notes/ws/bible-studies/my-testimony.org

* Was I guilty?
- "Romans 3:23" says that I am guilty, and Paul's intention I think is that people might know they are sinful even whilst having a beam in their own eye

Therefore, even if people accuse me of being guilty of something, I, having
admitted that I am not without sin, have the just attitude / wisdom of the just.

I know no man is righteous of their own.

** Am I remorseful?
If I am being qualified for entering the Kingdom of Heaven than my remorse which I have is the remorse for wrongdoing against God and my neighbour.
I do not bear any grudges either.
I have been trying to get to the point where I have no debt to anybody.
And where I am still loving my neighbour.
And loving my neighbour as myself.
I sacrifice for my neighbour because that's what I believe love looks like.

Love my neighbour as myself: If I want to be loved selflessly then I should love selflessly.

If I make my decisions with faith in God then I know God will ordain / decree / provide for me.
God will avenge me.

If I make my decisions with worldly wisdom then I know that that is to not have faith in God.
You cannot serve both God and money.

- Yes I am remorseful, but of
  - sin towards God
- I am living a life having repented and the fruit is good works

* The decision to be converted comes from the person themself
One must humble *themself* and be converted to enter the Kingdom of Heaven.

* It's possible that I should simply not go to cornerstone church if they have lowered their standards

* Jesus said they're either for Him or against Him
Now this is true.
Jesus is not the villain, though.
It's completely true that people are either for Jesus or against Him.

* Yeah, I really need to be able to hear from God

for you were formerly darkness, but now you
are Light in the Lord; walk as children of
Light (for the fruit of the Light consists in
all goodness and righteousness and truth),
trying to learn what is pleasing to the Lord.

Do not participate in the unfruitful deeds of
darkness, but instead even expose them; for it
is disgraceful even to speak of the things
which are done by them in secret.

But all things become visible when they are
exposed by the light, for everything that
becomes visible is light.

For this reason it says, “Awake, sleeper, And
arise from the dead, And Christ will shine on
you.” Therefore be careful how you walk, not
as unwise men but as wise, making the most of
your time, because the days are evil.

So then do not be foolish, but understand what
the will of the Lord is.

And do not get drunk with wine, for that is
dissipation, but be filled with the Spirit,
speaking to one another in psalms and hymns
and spiritual songs, singing and making melody
with your heart to the Lord; always giving

There is therefore now no condemnation to them
which are in Christ Jesus, who walk not after
the flesh, but after the Spirit.

For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ
Jesus hath made me free from the law of sin
and death.

For what the law could not do, in that it was
weak through the flesh, God sending his own
Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, and for
sin, condemned sin in the flesh: That the
righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in
us, who walk not after the flesh, but after
the Spirit.

For they that are after the flesh do mind the
things of the flesh; but they that are after
the Spirit the things of the Spirit.

For to be carnally minded is death; but to be
spiritually minded is life and peace.

Because the carnal mind is enmity against God:
for it is not subject to the law of God,
neither indeed can be.

So then they that are in the flesh cannot
please God.

But ye are not in the flesh, but in the
Spirit, if so be that the Spirit of God dwell
in you.

Now if any man have not the Spirit of Christ,
he is none of his.

And if Christ be in you, the body is dead
because of sin; but the Spirit is life because
of righteousness.

But if the Spirit of him that raised up Jesus
from the dead dwell in you, he that raised up
Christ from the dead shall also quicken your
mortal bodies by his Spirit that dwelleth in
you.

Therefore, brethren, we are debtors, not to
the flesh, to live after the flesh.

For if ye live after the flesh, ye shall die:
but if ye through the Spirit do mortify the
deeds of the body, ye shall live.

For as many as are led by the Spirit of God,
they are the sons of God.

For ye have not received the spirit of bondage
again to fear; but ye have received the Spirit
of adoption, whereby we cry, Abba, Father.

The Spirit himself beareth witness with our
spirit, that we are the children of God: And
if children, then heirs; heirs of God, and
joint-heirs with Christ; if so be that we
suffer with him, that we may be also glorified
together.

And for this cause he is the mediator of the
new testament, that by means of death, for the
redemption of the transgressions that were
under the first testament, they which are
called might receive the promise of eternal
inheritance.

For where a testament is, there must also of
necessity be the death of the testator.

For a testament is of force after men are
dead: otherwise it is of no strength at all
while the testator liveth.

Whereupon neither the first testament was
dedicated without blood.

For when Moses had spoken every precept to all
the people according to the law, he took the
blood of calves and of goats, with water, and
scarlet wool, and hyssop, and sprinkled both
the book, and all the people, Saying, This is
the blood of the testament which God hath
enjoined unto you.

Moreover he sprinkled with blood both the
tabernacle, and all the vessels of the
ministry.

And almost all things are by the law purged
with blood; and without shedding of blood is
no remission.

It was therefore necessary that the patterns
of things in the heavens should be purified
with these; but the heavenly things themselves
with better sacrifices than these.

For Christ is not entered into the holy places
made with hands, which are the figures of the
true; but into heaven itself, now to appear in
the presence of God for us: Nor yet that he
should offer himself often, as the high priest
entereth into the holy place every year with
blood of others; For then must he often have
suffered since the foundation of the world:
but now once in the end of the age hath he
appeared to put away sin by the sacrifice of
himself.

And as it is appointed unto men once to die,
but after this the judgment: So Christ was
once offered to bear the sins of many; and
unto them that look for him shall he appear
the second time without sin unto salvation.

For the law having a shadow of good things to
come, and not the very image of the things,
can never with those sacrifices which they
offered year by year continually make the
comers thereunto perfect.

For then would they not have ceased to be
offered?

because that the worshippers once purged
should have had no more conscience of sins.

But in those sacrifices there is a remembrance
again made of sins every year.

For it is not possible that the blood of bulls
and of goats should take away sins.

Wherefore when he cometh into the world, he
saith, Sacrifice and offering thou wouldest
not, but a body hast thou prepared me: In
burnt offerings and sacrifices for sin thou
hast had no pleasure.

Then said I, Lo, I come (in the volume of the
book it is written of me,) to do thy will, O
God.

Above when he said, Sacrifice and offering and
burnt offerings and offering for sin thou
wouldest not, neither hadst pleasure therein;
which are offered by the law; Then said he,
Lo, I come to do thy will, O God.

He taketh away the first, that he may
establish the second.

By the which will we are sanctified through
the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once
for all.

And every priest standeth daily ministering
and offering oftentimes the same sacrifices,
which can never take away sins: But this man,
after he had offered one sacrifice for sins
for ever, sat down on the right hand of God;
From henceforth expecting till his enemies be
made his footstool.

For by one offering he hath perfected for ever
them that are sanctified.

Whereof the Holy Ghost also is a witness to
us: for after that he had said before, This is
the covenant that I will make with them after
those days, saith the Lord, I will put my laws
into their hearts, and in their minds will I
write them;

It's nothing to do with self-defense, but about prophesy fulfillment.

Normally, Jesus wants us to rely on God to provide everything for us as
we preach the Kingdom of heaven.

Jesus only asked his disciples to carry belongings for the event
[[bible:Luke 22:52]] where the chief priests and officers of the temple
would help fulfill one of the prophesies "And He was numbered with
transgressors" [[bible:Isaiah 53:12]].

what good thing shall I do that I may obtain
eternal life?” And He said to him, “Why are
you asking Me about what is good?

There is only One who is good; but if you wish
to enter into life, keep the commandments.”
Then he said to Him, “Which ones?” And Jesus
said, “You shall not commit murder; You shall
not commit adultery; You shall not steal; You
shall not bear false witness; Honor your
father and mother; and You shall love your
neighbor as yourself.” The young man said to
Him, “All these things I have kept; what am I
still lacking?” Jesus said to him, “If you
wish to be complete, go and sell your
possessions and give to the poor, and you will
have treasure in heaven; and come, follow Me.”
But when the young man heard this statement,
he went away grieving; for he was one who
owned much property.

And Jesus said to His disciples, “Truly I say
to you, it is hard for a rich man to enter the
kingdom of heaven.

Again I say to you, it is easier for a camel
to go through the eye of a needle, than for a
rich man to enter the kingdom of God.” When

In John 17, Jesus says he has imparted glory to His disciples.
If someone is born-again, their sins up to this point are forgiven.
After this point that person must stop sinning, and if thy sin they have an advocate with God the Father, our Lord Jesus.
God is greater than our heart - He sees the full picture.
So long as a person is forgiving others and confessing their sin, God is faithful and just to forgive, even the sins we do not see.

Freely you have received, therefore freely give.
Henceforth, it's important to be gracious with others.

It's probable that having received the Holy Spirit a person may be then tested.
This test may test to see if someone is a true disciple of Jesus.
If a person has belongings when they are tested, they may need to sell them and give to the poor.
The person must die with repect to the world in order to be used maximally by Jesus for the Kingdom.
When the test comes, the person is faced with perceived unfairness against them.
A person must humble themself.
But keep in mind Romans 3:23 -- for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God.
We are all guilty and grace is only given to those who can recognise that.
Even after being born-again, humbling is required, and humbling to the point where that person is
walking as Jesus walked, in His commandments.
If you have received much, then much is required of you.
During the trial and even after the trial, every scenario which challenges the person to
demonstrate the character andd righteousness of Christ through following His commandments, is
a potential good work which had actaully been prepared in advance for the newborn Christian to walk in.

While following in Jesus' commandments, a person remains in Jesus' love, and
the blood of Jesus cleanses us from sin.

Jesus' commandments are a law of liberty, and following them we give mercy to
others. While giving mercy to others, we ourselves are able to receive mercy from God.

That day Jesus went out of the house and was
sitting by the sea.

And large crowds gathered to Him, so He got
into a boat and sat down, and the whole crowd
was standing on the beach.

And He spoke many things to them in parables,
saying, “Behold, the sower went out to sow;
and as he sowed, some seeds fell beside the
road, and the birds came and ate them up.

Others fell on the rocky places, where they
did not have much soil; and immediately they
sprang up, because they had no depth of soil.

But when the sun had risen, they were
scorched; and because they had no root, they
withered away.

Others fell among the thorns, and the thorns
came up and choked them out.

And others fell on the good soil and yielded a
crop, some a hundredfold, some sixty, and some
thirty.

He who has ears, let him hear.” And the
disciples came and said to Him, “Why do You
speak to them in parables?” Jesus answered
them, “To you it has been granted to know the
mysteries of the kingdom of heaven, but to
them it has not been granted.

For whoever has, to him more shall be given,
and he will have an abundance; but whoever
does not have, even what he has shall be taken
away from him.

Therefore I speak to them in parables; because
while seeing they do not see, and while
hearing they do not hear, nor do they
understand.

In their case the prophecy of Isaiah is being
fulfilled, which says, ‘You will keep on
hearing, but will not understand; You will
keep on seeing, but will not perceive; For the
heart of this people has become dull, With
their ears they scarcely hear, And they have
closed their eyes, Otherwise they would see
with their eyes, Hear with their ears, And
understand with their heart and return, And I
would heal them.’ But blessed are your eyes,
because they see; and your ears, because they
hear.

For truly I say to you that many prophets and
righteous men desired to see what you see, and
did not see it, and to hear what you hear, and
did not hear it.

“Hear then the parable of the sower.

When anyone hears the word of the kingdom and
does not understand it, the evil one comes and
snatches away what has been sown in his heart.

This is the one on whom seed was sown beside
the road.

The one on whom seed was sown on the rocky
places, this is the man who hears the word and
immediately receives it with joy; yet he has
no firm root in himself, but is only
temporary, and when affliction or persecution
arises because of the word, immediately he
falls away.

And the one on whom seed was sown among the
thorns, this is the man who hears the word,
and the worry of the world and the
deceitfulness of wealth choke the word, and it
becomes unfruitful.

And the one on whom seed was sown on the good
soil, this is the man who hears the word and
understands it; who indeed bears fruit and
brings forth, some a hundredfold, some sixty,
and some thirty.” Jesus presented another
parable to them, saying, “The kingdom of
heaven may be compared to a man who sowed good
seed in his field.

But while his men were sleeping, his enemy
came and sowed tares among the wheat, and went
away.

But when the wheat sprouted and bore grain,
then the tares became evident also.

The slaves of the landowner came and said to
him, ‘Sir, did you not sow good seed in your
field?

How then does it have tares?’ And he said to
them, ‘An enemy has done this!’ The slaves
said to him, ‘Do you want us, then, to go and
gather them up?’ But he said, ‘No; for while
you are gathering up the tares, you may uproot
the wheat with them.

Allow both to grow together until the harvest;
and in the time of the harvest I will say to
the reapers, “First gather up the tares and
bind them in bundles to burn them up; but
gather the wheat into my barn.”’” He presented
another parable to them, saying, “The kingdom
of heaven is like a mustard seed, which a man
took and sowed in his field; and this is
smaller than all other seeds, but when it is
full grown, it is larger than the garden
plants and becomes a tree, so that the birds
of the air come and nest in its branches.” He
spoke another parable to them, “The kingdom of
heaven is like leaven, which a woman took and
hid in three pecks of flour until it was all
leavened.” All these things Jesus spoke to the
crowds in parables, and He did not speak to
them without a parable.

This was to fulfill what was spoken through
the prophet: “I will open My mouth in
parables; I will utter things hidden since the
foundation of the world.” Then He left the
crowds and went into the house.

And His disciples came to Him and said,
“Explain to us the parable of the tares of the
field.” And He said, “The one who sows the
good seed is the Son of Man, and the field is
the world; and as for the good seed, these are
the sons of the kingdom; and the tares are the
sons of the evil one; and the enemy who sowed
them is the devil, and the harvest is the end
of the age; and the reapers are angels.

So just as the tares are gathered up and
burned with fire, so shall it be at the end of
the age.

The Son of Man will send forth His angels, and
they will gather out of His kingdom all
stumbling blocks, and those who commit
lawlessness, and will throw them into the
furnace of fire; in that place there will be
weeping and gnashing of teeth.

Then the righteous will shine forth as the sun
in the kingdom of their Father.

He who has ears, let him hear.

“The kingdom of heaven is like a treasure
hidden in the field, which a man found and hid
again; and from joy over it he goes and sells
all that he has and buys that field.

“Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a
merchant seeking fine pearls, and upon finding
one pearl of great value, he went and sold all
that he had and bought it.

“Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a
dragnet cast into the sea, and gathering fish
of every kind; and when it was filled, they
drew it up on the beach; and they sat down and
gathered the good fish into containers, but
the bad they threw away.

So it will be at the end of the age; the
angels will come forth and take out the wicked
from among the righteous, and will throw them
into the furnace of fire; in that place there
will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.

“Have you understood all these things?” They
said to Him, “Yes.” And Jesus said to them,
“Therefore every scribe who has become a
disciple of the kingdom of heaven is like a
head of a household, who brings out of his
treasure things new and old.” When Jesus had
finished these parables, He departed from
there.

He came to His hometown and began teaching
them in their synagogue, so that they were
astonished, and said, “Where did this man get
this wisdom and these miraculous powers?

Is not this the carpenter’s son?

Is not His mother called Mary, and His
brothers, James and Joseph and Simon and
Judas?

And His sisters, are they not all with us?

Where then did this man get all these things?”
And they took offense at Him.

But Jesus said to them, “A prophet is not
without honor except in his hometown and in
his own household.” And He did not do many
miracles there because of their unbelief.
