Dear Heavenly Father, and my Lord Jesus Christ, and Holy Spirit,
Jehovah God,
please, LORD, bring Elon Musk to the obedience of faith in Jesus Christ.
Please open his eyes to see the glory of the gospel of Jesus Christ.
Please enlighten his heart to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ.
And, LORD God, please grant him repentance to life.
Please, LORD God, use Elon Musk to influence many people to put their faith in You, LORD God.
Please, LORD God, I think it would be awesome of Elon Musk did something really radical, like give a lot of money to the poor, or try to solve lots of problems like homelessness, for example.
Please, LORD God, influence him to obey the gospel of Jesus Christ.
Please, LORD God, teach him to be selfless, and to not bear grudges,
but to love his enemies, and especially those in CHrist.
In Jesus Christ's name I ask,
AMEN!!

Dear Heavenly Father, and my Lord Jesus Christ, and Holy Spirit,
Jehovah God,
Why do I think Ryan needed a rebuke?
Because he was teaching against the sound words of Jesus Christ, and leading people astray, and deterring people from having confidence in Jesus' commandments.
God help him, he's deluded.
We do indeed need to remain faithful to Jesus.
What Ryan was saying about Sam being wrong about needing to be faithful to Jesus was disgusting.
Please, LORD God, if I have incorrect theology, then please guide and correct me.
Please, LORD God, if I need correction, please continue correcting me.
In Jesus Christ's name I ask,
AMEN!!

  *Jude 1:4-5* - For certain people have crept in unnoticed who long ago were designated for this condemnation, ungodly people, who pervert the grace of our God into sensuality and deny our only Master and Lord, Jesus Christ. Now I want to remind you, although you once fully knew it, that Jesus, who saved a people out of the land of Egypt, afterward destroyed those who did not believe. (ESV)

  *II Timothy 2:11-18* - The saying is trustworthy, for: _If we have died with him, we will also live with him; if we endure, we will also reign with him; if we deny him, he also will deny us; if we are faithless, he remains faithfulâ€” for he cannot deny himself_. Remind them of these things, and charge them before God not to quarrel about words, which does no good, but only ruins the hearers. Do your best to present yourself to God as one approved, a worker who has no need to be ashamed, rightly handling the word of truth. But _avoid irreverent babble, for it will lead people into more and more ungodliness, and their talk will spread like gangrene_. Among them are Hymenaeus and Philetus, who have *swerved from the truth, saying that the resurrection has already happened*. They are upsetting the faith of some. (ESV)

Indeed, we need to turn away from the evil of our doings.

+ [[https://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0126.htm][newadvent.org: CHURCH FATHERS: The First Apology {St. Justin Martyr}]] :: I will also relate the manner in which we dedicated ourselves to God when we had been made new through Christ; lest, if we omit this, we seem to be unfair in the explanation we are making. As many as are persuaded and believe that what we teach and say is true, and undertake to be able to live accordingly, are instructed to pray and to entreat God with fasting, for the remission of their sins that are past, we praying and fasting with them. Then they are brought by us where there is water, and are regenerated in the same manner in which we were ourselves regenerated. For, in the name of God, the Father and Lord of the universe, and of our Saviour Jesus Christ, and of the Holy Spirit, they then receive the washing with water. For Christ also said, _"Unless you be born again, you shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven."_ [[https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%203%3A5&version=ESV][John 3:5]] Now, that it is impossible for those who have once been born to enter into their mothers' wombs, is manifest to all. And how those who have sinned and repent shall escape their sins, is declared by Esaias the prophet, as I wrote above; he thus speaks: _"Wash you, make you clean; put away the evil of your doings from your souls; learn to do well; judge the fatherless, and plead for the widow: and come and let us reason together, says the Lord. And though your sins be as scarlet, I will make them white like wool; and though they be as crimson, I will make them white as snow. But if you refuse and rebel, the sword shall devour you: for the mouth of the Lord has spoken it."_ [[https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah%201%3A16-20&version=ESV][Isaiah 1:16-20]]
