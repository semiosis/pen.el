Lord Jesus Christ, I feel like You have sliced
me in half, and exposed me my insides to
demons.

Thanks, not.
Please, God, demonstrate grace in Jesus' name.
I want to be delivered.
There's no such thing as a white lie.
No lie is of the Truth.
I want to be delivered from all lies.
I thought You were greater, LORD God.
Would You call agape love a lie?
Why, LORD God, would You have allowed to happen what happened?
I want to be totally healed.
I don't want to be living a lie.
Deliver me immediately in Jesus Christ's name.
I rebuke that evil spirit of sexual immorality, that spirit of LGBT, which came between me and Melee.
I rebuke it in Jesus Christ's name.
I say to it, be gone in Jesus Christ's name.
A world where satan is crushed under my feet looks like standing up for obedience to Jesus, for faith in Jesus and for denying sin and having that evil
crushed under my feet so that there's no longer any evil spirit which is trying to destroy marriage in favour of licentiousness / sexual immorality,
and also where there isn't such obscene wealth inequality.
That's what it looks like for satan to be crushed under my feet.
I pray that Jesus crushes satan under my feet.


Dear Heavenly Father and my Lord Jesus Christ and Holy Spirit,
Jehovah God,
maybe, LORD, You do have my best interests at heart.
But I said it so many times.
I'm getting very angry.
I want You to deliver me from that spirit spouse garbage - that sexual sin or whatever it is - that defilement of spirit.
I want to be delivered from it.
I've asked so many times.
I'm not really asking anymore.
My asks are now me telling You to do it.
I'm telling You to make it go away.
Make the LGBT stuff go away, LORD.
Make it go away, LORD.
Deliver me in Jesus Christ's name.
I have no-one else who can save me.
Make the evil go away in Jesus Christ's name, or kill me off please.
I don't want to be in this hellhole.
Please save me from the bad memories.
Please deliver me from those horrific memories, LORD.
Please deliver me from the lies.
LORD God, I had said that You saved me from lies.
But look what has happened.
Look what happened.
LORD God, You have allowed me to be attacked incessantly by demons.
I don't think it's going to help the faith of my friends, LORD, if You continue to allow me to be attacked by demons.
The reason is that I am I think spent, and I am depressed.
You've taken Melee away.
I'm not able to live properly.
I wonder where Your heart is.
If I can't live properly and I complain and I tell people about the demonic attacks which I've been receiving
then that might damage their faith.
Please, God, have mercy.
Make the satanic resistance stop.
Make it stop please in Jesus Christ's name.
I want to be set free.
There's too much injustice for me to tolerate the gay stuff, LORD God.
Bring back marriage between man and woman.
That's definitely not the only problem in this world, but it's a massive problem, the marriage denial stuff.
I just rebuke the marriage denial.
I do not want to be attacked spiritually anymore.
That has to stop.
It's definitely not OK.
Is it going to stop?
Will I be attacked again?
Or am I delivered?
I pray You have delivered me.
