Dear Heavenly Father, Almighty God Jehovah,
God, I do not want to mess anything up.
I am so sorry, Lord Jesus.
I am so sorry, Lord Jesus.
I feel like I've been stuffing up for so long.
Please, God, forgive me.
God Almighty, I don't want to be here, LORD.
I feel as though I have stuffed things up too much.
LORD, whatever happened, I feel just was super messed up.
I do not understand it.
I want to be sanctified in Jesus Christ's name.
Being held against my will in this state is disgusting.
My will is to be sanctified, LORD.
Your will is for my sanctification.
Therefore, LORD God Jesus Christ Jehovah,
I want to be sanctified!
I want that sanctification. Don't let the enemy steal it from me.
Deliver me from the enemy's snare in Jesus Christ's name and
allow me to be sanctified.
Deliver me from satan's snare and allow me to be sanctified in Jesus Christ's name.
AMEN!!


I rebuke all of that demonic invasion of my mind in Jesus Christ's name.


I record here that even 2 days before Christmas, I had an obscene amount of demonic dreams last night.
A very large amount of antichrist dreams raping my mind last night happened.
And Jesus allowed it to happen, since it indeed happened.


But I rebuke the dreams, and I want to be delivered in Jesus Christ's name.
I will be set free from this in Jesus Christ's name.


Dear Heavenly Father, Almighty God Jehovah,
whatever situation I'm currently in regarding continual spiritual attack,
and the enemy trying to prop me up in some way which is totally not what I'm praying for,
probably in order to deceive lots of people - it's evil.
When I pray, in some ways I seem to experience the opposite of what I pray for.
There's also that demonised hindu person in Mumbai who seems to be stalking me.
God Almighty, God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, God of Israel, deliver me in the name of Jesus Christ.
Deliver me in Jesus Christ's name I pray,
AMEN!!


Lord Jesus Christ please help me in Jesus Christ's name.
I do not understand why this satanic spirit has been allowed to continue harassing me.
God Almighty I need Your help.
Help me in Jesus' name.
