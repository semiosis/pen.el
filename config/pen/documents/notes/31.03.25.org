I always have regret thinking that I wish You would use me more.
However, LORD God, I don't think I can deal with corruption in my body and soul.
I don't think I can.
I want to be clean.

LORD God, if You do not deliver me from what I cannot deal with sinwise, then I think I'll die.
I need You to help me.
LORD God, I remain faithful and obedient to You - that is my duty and Your duty is to clean me with Jesus' blood.
Your duty, LORD God, is to save me.
Please deliver me LORD God in Jesus Christ's name I ask,
AMEN!!
