I want to be healed.
I'm sick of these confrontations.
I'm sick of these spiritual attacks.
I want to do what You want me to do, God.
I want to hear from You.
God, it's torment not being able to hear from You.
Just tell me what You want.
I want to be clean.
I want to be spiritually clean.
I don't want to be an adulterer.
I don't want to propose another time to someone else.
I want You to help me, God.
I want You to clean me.
I want You to protect me at night and during the day.

Please, Lord Jesus Christ, heal my soul.
Repair my soul, please, LORD.
