Dear Heavenly Father, and my Lord Jesus Christ, and Holy Spirit,
Jehovah God,
please, LORD, in Jesus Christ's name please don't destroy me,
or let me be destroyed.
I believe in You, God.
I'm scared.
I'm scared, LORD.
Lord Jesus, I'm scared.
I'm really scared, LORD God, of saying and doing the wrong thing, of my sin, of believing the wrong things and of condemning the wrong things,
and from making a record of events.
God please have mercy on my soul.
God please don't destroy me.
I do not understand properly what has happened.
