Dear Heavenly Father, and my Lord Jesus Christ,
Jehovah God,
Almighty God,
please, God, in Jesus Christ's name, help me to overcome the evil.
Please, God, in Jesus Christ's name, forgive me if I have said anything
which is not correct.
Father God, I'm trying to be corrected, and to help others come to faith in You through Jesus,
and to be corrected.
Please forgive me LORD.
Please, God, I would like to know if, how and/or where I have been acting wrongly or saying the wrong things,
so that I can fix my behaviour and understanding.
Please, God, help me to speak Scripturally sound words.
I do not want to say the wrong thing.
In Jesus Christ's name I ask and pray,
AMEN!!


Dear Heavenly Father, and my Lord Jesus Christ,
Jehovah God,
LORD God, I do not know why You continue to allow me to be harassed by antichrist, the flesh, the world.
It doesn't make sense why You let this happen.
It's not fun.
Please, God, in Jesus Christ's name deliver me,
AMEN!!


Dear Heavenly Father, and my Lord Jesus Christ,
Jehovah God, Yahweh,
God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob,
God, I am so, so sorry.
God, I love You, I truly do, God, and I want to do that better.
I'm so sorry, LORD.
This place has so much darkness.
It's not Your fault, LORD.
God when I have blamed You, I know it's not Your fault.
I'm just so tired.
It's such a dark place, LORD.
Please, LORD, forgive me for getting upset.
I would really prefer to not be here.
Please, LORD, if You want me here then please bring me out of this trial and tribulation,
but, God, Your will be done.
I am sorry for continuing to masturbate and stuff.
It's awful.
I just want peace.
LORD God, I want peace in my body.
I do not want to wake up to erections and strange dreams.
Please, God, deliver me from that evil.
I will try my hardest tomorrow, especially if I remember, to avoid masturbation, LORD.
God it's awful.
I'm so sorry.
You deserve all praise God.
Thank You very much for Your salvation.
In Jesus Christ's name I ask and pray,
AMEN!!
