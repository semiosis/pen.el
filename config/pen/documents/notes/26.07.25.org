Lord Jesus Christ, I want to be clean.


Dear Heavenly Father and my Lord Jesus Christ and Holy Spirit,
Jehovah, Almighty God,
please, LORD, instead of allowing satan to attack my mind, please let me know what You want me to do.
In Jesus Christ's name, I ask,
AMEN!!


Dear Heavenly Father and my Lord Jesus Christ, and Holy Spirit,
Jehovah God, Immanuel, God with us,
Lord God, Jesus Christ of Nazareth, Son of God, Word of God,
Lord Jesus Christ, You died for me so I can be set free from sin and live for righteousness.
Whatever is attacking my soul, please make it stop in Your precious name, I ask.
Whatever is trying to make me aroused, please make it stop in Jesus Christ's name, I ask.
Please, God, also protect Amelia.
In Jesus Christ's name, I ask.
Please, God, I want her to be my sister in Christ, and want her to be protected.
I believe that's Your heart.
Please, God, deliver me, and deliver her in Jesus Christ's name, I ask,
AMEN!!


Dear Heavenly Father, and my Lord Jesus Christ and Holy Spirit,
Jehovah God, Immanuel, God with us,
LORD God Almighty, Yeshuah HaMachiach,
Immanuel,
Father God, and Son of God, Word of God, and Holy Spirit,
please, LORD, don't hold me as accursed.
I am trying to share Your gospel as commanded, to the best of my ability and knowledge.
Please, LORD God, I have had to fight a spiritual battle against many liars.
Please, LORD God, deliver me whole from this awful situation which I have found myself in.
LORD God, I have been under almost constant spiritual attack.
Please, LORD God, I believe in You, I trust in You and I am giving You all I can.
Please, God, deliver me whole.
Please deliver me and speak to me Your Word,
and guide me, LORD, to do whatever You want me to do, to think whatever You want me to think.
Please, God, just identify Yourself, though, because I will not trust any spirit which refuses to confess Father God that Jesus Christ is Your only begotten Son and that He has come into the world in the flesh and died on a tree and rose 3 days later.
LORD God, please identify Yourself and speak to me through Your Holy Spirit.
The spiritual attacks I have endured are painful, LORD God.
Deliver me whole in Jesus Christ's name, I ask,
In Jesus Christ's name, I ask,
AMEN!!


Dear Heavenly Father and my Lord Jesus Christ and Holy Spirit,
Jehovah, Almighty God,
I just want to be set free, LORD God.
Please, God, I'm very scared now,
because I feel like I'm being judged,
and I feel like I'm in a pit which I can't get out of by myself.
I need Your help, LORD Jesus Christ.
Please help me, God.
Please help me, God, in Jesus Christ's name, I ask,
AMEN!!
