Dear Heavenly Father, and my Lord Jesus Christ and Holy Spirit,
Jehovah God,
help me, God, in Jesus Christ's name.
Help me. Don't delay. Don't ignore my prayer requests.
I'm going to lose my faith in You if You do not respond.
You haven't rescued me, but as I have told You many times,
I need You to rescue me.
Please, LORD, be the all-powerful, loving God Your Word says You are.
Be the Almighty Good Shepherd who saves.
And deliver me from evil.
In Jesus Christ's name I ask,
AMEN!!



Lord Jesus Christ,
I don't have the words to describe my sadness at
how You have not delivered me from evil, but seem
to have even given me up to some kind of spiritual prison.
Lord Jesus Christ, I don't know what's happened but it's simply not right.
I want You to be true to Your Word and to deliver me because
right now, it seems as though You are not being true to Your word.
It pains me to say that.
But if I'm being attacked the way I've been attacked, in a way
that is so violating, and if You will not speak to me,
even after I pour my heart out to You in obedience to Your Word,
then it shows that You haven't spoken truth in saying that if I
abide in Your Word, You will make Your abode with me.
It seems as though You did not speak the truth because
You've allowed demons to attack me.
You haven't rescued me, LORD.
Why don't You speak?
Is there something literally wrong with You?
When did You become the god who doesn't speak?


Dear Heavenly Father, and my Lord Jesus Christ, and Holy Spirit,
Jehovah God,
God help me please.
You must deliver me from evil.
How can You expect me to function properly when You allow me to be attacked by satan?
Lord Jesus Christ, I confess I was weak and that I sinned by giving in to the devil and obeying the flesh.
Lord Jesus Christ, I need Your help.
How can I resist the devil when after submitting to You, You don't help me?
Please help me, God.
Please protect me.
In Jesus Christ's name I ask,
AMEN!!


Dear Heavenly Father, and my Lord Jesus Christ, and Holy Spirit,
Jehovah God,
please, LORD God, set me free from whatever has been plaguing me.
LORD God, please help me.
I do not want to perish.
I do not know what's going on with me, particularly at night.
I do not understand what is going on with me.
I need You to help me.
Please, LORD God, deliver me in Jesus Christ's name.
Please, God, deliver me.
I need Your help desperately.
LORD God, do not let sin reign in my body.
I need Your help, LORD God, to put sin to death.
I need your help, LORD God, so I can rest.
Please help me Jesus.
In Jesus Christ's name I ask and pray,
AMEN!!


Dear Heavenly Father, and my Lord Jesus Christ, and Holy Spirit,
Jehovah God,
LORD God, please, God, don't let me perish.
Please, God, I need help, God.
I need Your protection, God.
Please help me, LORD God, in Jesus Christ's name I ask,
AMEN!!


Please heal me, LORD God.


Dear Heavenly Father, and my Lord Jesus Christ and Holy Spirit,
Jehovah God,
please, LORD, heal me and sanctify me completely
and protect me, LORD.
Make the movement in my genitals stop in Jesus Christ's name.
Make it stop.
Make my soul be at rest.
God Almighty, deliver me in Jesus Christ's name.
Let me not get demonic dreams, LORD God.
I want only dreams from You, LORD God.
Let my mind and soul not be invaded by satan.
Let my mind and soul only belong to the Holy Spirit.
Deliver me in Jesus Christ's name.
In Jesus Christ's name I ask,
AMEN!!


Dear Heavenly Father and my Lord Jesus Christ and Holy Spirit,
please, God, deliver me in Jesus Christ's name.
Lord Jesus Christ, I need to hear from You.
Please, God, speak to me clearly in Your precious name I ask.
No more of ignoring me, please, God.
No more of this Star Wars falsehood.
No more.
You are not a God of confusion, and dreams and visions which do not agree at all with Scripture are not from You.
I want to hear clearly from You, LORD God.
So deliver me from these ambiguous dreams in Jesus Christ's name, I ask.
Deliver me from these ambiguous dreams and vision which are from the devil.
They are dreams from demons, LORD God.
I want truthful dreams from You, LORD.
Deliver me, LORD.
Do not allow the enemy to attack me.
Sanctify me completely, LORD.
I got a very raw deal, LORD.
I want You to sanctify me properly.
No more of this unfair treatment, LORD.
Sanctify me properly and completely, LORD Jesus Christ.
Deliver me from demons.
I don't know how many times I need to ask You.
Deliver me from demons in Your precious name, I ask.
Please hear me God and do this thing.
Hurry up, LORD Jesus Christ.
Deliver me in Jesus Christ's name.
Even as I lie on this bed and feel my body being attacked, I wonder, what on earth are You up to?
Why on earth do You not hurry up and deliver me.
I don't understand it.
What is not getting through?
Make the demonic dreams end in Jesus Christ's name.
When I sleep tonight I do not want to be harassed.
I want to hear from You clearly - audible voice.
I want to hear from You, and I want answers to questions I have.
I want answers.
I want to be led into Your Truth.
I want it to be as Your Word says.
AMEN!!


Help me Jesus Christ.
