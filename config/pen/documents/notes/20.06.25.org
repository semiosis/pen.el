Dear Heavenly Father and my Lord Jesus Christ and Holy Spirit,
Jehovah, Almighty God,
I fully give up with the Melee stuff.
I gave it back to Jesus.
I gave it back to You, God.
But the devil has not been relenting to try to get me to "betray Jesus"
and also to attack me and accuse me as I try to remain faithful to Jesus.
So I've been attacked with not only temptation but also
with accusation, and both temptation and accusation spiritually and physically.
I've been attacked in several different ways.
And it's been going on for a very long time.
Please deliver me Jesus, from this constant satanic oppression.
In Jesus Christ's name I ask,
AMEN!!


Dear Heavenly Father and my Lord Jesus Christ and Holy Spirit,
Jehovah, Almighty God,
please, LORD God, continue sanctifying me.
Please help me to know what to say to people who are abusive.
In Jesus Christ's name, I ask,
AMEN!!
