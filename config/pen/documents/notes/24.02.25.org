Dear Heavenly Father, and my Lord Jesus Christ,
Jehovah God,
LORD God, I am unsure what to do regarding the USA.
LORD God, I am very sorry if I have been a big disappointment
for choosing to not put in my two-cents regarding politics.
LORD God, if it is Your will that the world continues on
then please put a muzzle on this AI stuff.
I do not believe that it's in any way a good idea to be replacing human beings
with robots and with AI.
I still firmly believe that AI implants is simply not a good idea.
I think it's a really good start that Donald Trump has been promoting the name of Jesus, giving Jesus recognition as King.
I can't see deep into the future, LORD God.
I don't know what Your plans are.
Your ways are not my ways.
Your ways are higher.
Your will be done, Lord Jesus.
Father God, I think we really need the church communities.
I think that having church communities is really important.
Please support these communities.
Please support and strengthen Your church.
Please, LORD, help bring Elon Musk to faith in You through Jesus Christ.
I think that would be a good idea, if possible, LORD God.
Please keep the POTUS, and Elon Musk making moral, ethical decisions,
and, LORD, if it is Your will, grant them repentance that leads to life,
and lead them to true faith, trusting and obeying You, trusting and obeying
the Lord Jesus Christ.
LORD God, I know Your Kingdom is not of this world.
Thank You for the blessing of being able to have faith in You,
and for not being terribly persecuted.
Thank You, LORD.
Please, LORD, it's truly a wonderful blessing that Christians are allowed to worship and practice their faith.
Please, God, if it is Your will, grant Elon Musk and Donald Trump repentance to life and an authentic, genuine faith in You, and experience of You and relationship with You.
Oh how difficult it is for a rich man to enter the Kingdom of God.
I know, LORD.
I truly believe that monetary wealth is simply not true wealth.
I know, LORD God, it is difficult for a man to enter the Kingdom of God, with huge amounts of money while they are serving and trusting in money.
If it is Your will, LORD, at whichever point in the future this may be,
simply grant them some insight into the reality of You, LORD.
So when they become disillusioned with this world, they will be able to
know You as their Lord and Saviour God.
Please protect Your people.
Please, God, keep protecting Your people in the USA.
In Jesus Christ's name I ask,
AMEN!!


Dear Heavenly Father, and my Lord Jesus Christ, and Holy Spirit,
Jehovah God,
Lord Jesus, what do You want me to do?
I mean, I want You to lead me and provide for me as I simply obey You.
That is what I want to do.
That is what makes sense to me.
Please, LORD God, direct me on what to do.
I'm trying to figure out how to have a relationship with You.
Please help me God, to have a relationship with You where
I'm walking in Your ways.
This is all that makes sense to me.
I simply do not know what You want me to do though.
Please, LORD God, continue sanctifying me and teaching me
and leading me.
Please help me to know what to do.
Please, LORD God, keep teaching me.
I want to do Your will, LORD God.
Please, God, lead me on paths of righteousness for Your sake.
In Jesus Christ's name I ask,
AMEN!!
