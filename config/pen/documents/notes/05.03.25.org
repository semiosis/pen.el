Please don't ignore me.
I've been prevented from marrying and finding work.
Some satanic force has been pushing for greed/theft/antichrist/anti-God's-Law in the world,
and I just don't have the power to deal with it myself.
I need You, God.
What influence would I have on the next generation?
God help me.

It's awful.
