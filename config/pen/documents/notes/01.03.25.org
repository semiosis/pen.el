Dear Heavenly Father, and my Lord Jesus Christ,
and Holy Spirit,
Jehovah God,
please, Lord God, I'm so tired.
I don't know what to do.
Please tell me what You want me to do.
Please, God, bring me into a place where I do not feel as though I am in any way corrupted.
I want to be clean.
Lord God, I need to be cleaned.
I need You to clean me, please God.
Please, God, rescue me.
I need You to help me.
Father God, I want to be able to work so that I can help people.
It's wrong that I've been unable to work - it's wrong.
Please, God, in Jesus Christ's name, deliver me from that satanic spirit which has been denying me work.
Please, God, in Jesus Christ's name, deliver me.
I need You to deliver me, LORD God, in Jesus Christ's name - please do so.
Please deliver me, LORD God, from that damn spirit spouse thing.
Please deliver me, LORD God, from those antichrist dreams, and from false prophets.
Please deliver me, LORD God, in Jesus Christ's name.
Please help me and heal me and protect me, LORD God, in Jesus Christ's name I ask,
AMEN!!
