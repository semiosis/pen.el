Dear Heavenly Father and my Lord Jesus Christ and Holy Spirit,
Jehovah, Almighty God,
thank You, LORD for giving me peace today.
Please don't let me die.
Please give me the grace to be totally sanctified.
In Jesus Christ's name, I ask,
AMEN!!


Lord Jesus Christ, I'm really concerned about my soul, LORD.
When I'm having issues, I get scared.


Dear Heavenly Father, and my Lord Jesus Christ and Holy Spirit,
Jehovah, Almighty God,
please, LORD, I want to be found blameless.
Blameless.
God, I don't believe it's enabling people's sin by doing good deeds out of love and obedience.
Lord Jesus Christ, I want to be found blameless.
LORD, I want to be set free from any influence of homosexuality.
Please, God, deliver me.
I don't want to die.
Please, God, what am I supposed to do?
Lord Jesus Christ, please, I want to be totally cleaned up and sanctified, and delivered.
I don't want to be in this world at all, LORD.
I don't want to be here.
Thank You, LORD, for Your faithfulness.
I am so sorry, LORD God.
