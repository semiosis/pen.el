Dear Heavenly Father, and my Lord Jesus Christ, and Holy Spirit,
Jehovah God,
please, LORD God, deliver me from this disgusting spirit of sexual impurity.
Please, LORD God, protect watchman river. Please rapture both of us, LORD God.
I don't want to be here in this world, God.
LORD God, I want to have the right perspective on this.
I believe it's good to lead other people to Christ.
But it's far better to be with You, Lord Jesus Christ.
Lord Jesus Christ, please deliver me, LORD God.
Please, God, deliver me from sexual immorality.
I want to be delivered from the evil, LORD God.
I feel like it's right to put a stop to sexual immorality and impurity and even put a stop to stuff like ABDL if it's what You think is right, LORD, but I don't think it's right to say that the marriage proposal was wrong.
Yes, LORD God.
I don't want to call evil what is good.
Please, God, help me.
Please stamp out the evil and put satan under my feet.
In Jesus Christ's name I ask,
AMEN!!


Dear Heavenly Father, and my Lord Jesus Christ and Holy Spirit,
Jehovah God,
Father God, I believe that Jesus Christ, Your Son, died for my sins,
so that I can die to sin and live for righteousness.
Now, LORD, there are many demons trying to prevent me from living righteously.
Please, God, help me, and deliver me from those demons.
I'm irate because I've been getting attacked by demons, and I've literally poured my heart and soul out to serve You God, and be corrected by You,
and You've allowed me to be attacked by demons, and it's gone too far, LORD God.
I want You to deliver me from evil right now in Jesus Christ's name.
Stop allowing me to be attacked by demons right now in Jesus Christ's name.
Sanctify my mind and soul in Jesus Christ's name.
AMEN!!


Set me free in Jesus Christ's name.


Worship God in your body, Shane.


Lord Jesus Christ, this world is crude.
Is nothing sacred.
Is not even Your precepts sacred to You?
They are sacred to me - that is TRUE.
Then why do You not want me to be able to love them and appreciate them?


I rebuke that anti-marriage spirit in Jesus Christ's name.
I rebuke the sexual immorality spirit in Jesus Christ's name.
I rebuke whatever has come between me and being married and I rebuke it in Jesus Christ's name until it goes to hell.
