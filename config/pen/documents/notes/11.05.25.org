Dear Heavenly Father, and my Lord Jesus Christ and Holy Spirit,
Jehovah God,
please, LORD, let me rest.
I'm tired.
I don't know what to do.
I want to hear from You, LORD.
I do not believe that the devil can steal my salvation.
LORD God, please deliver me from the spiritual harassment I've received.
Please, God, deliver me in Jesus Christ's name.

Please, God, protect me at night.
Lord Jesus Christ,
I was attacked through the night again.
I don't understand why You have been allowing this, LORD.
Deliver me please in Jesus Christ's name I ask,
AMEN!!


I have said it many times, I am moving on from Melee.
I'm committed to doing it.
Now, LORD, You have said, "Commit your way to the LORD. Trust in Him and He will act."

I commit myself to walking in Your ways.
I commit to striving to bring holiness to perfection.


Every day I pray, asking for You to make the spiritual attack stop.
Yet here I am, just another day where I receive spiritual attack - evil dreams in my sleep,
and demons attacking my soul.
I'm not impressed, LORD.
You haven't been clear at all to me regarding instructions.
Wow, LORD Jesus, how long has it been that I have been asking You to deliver me from spiritual attack in my sleep?
It's been too long, and I rebuke the spiritual attack with all authority.
It's at the point now where I'm very much questioning whether You have any ability to deliver me, and I'm very unsure why it continues,
and I'm unsure why You haven't spoken to me to clear things up.
If You allow the devil to attack me and don't honour my prayer requests at all as I seek to serve You, then what does that say about You?
I want deliverance.
Give me deliverance, please.
