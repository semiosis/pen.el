Dear Heavenly Father, and my Lord Jesus Christ,
I don't know what I'm doing here.
I'm scared, LORD.
I'm scared because of sin.
Please, God, I need You to rescue me from all of it.
Please, forgive me, Lord Jesus and clean me and heal me completely.
Please, God, I'm trusting You.
I need You to deliver me.
I'm also very confused with all the evil spirits harassing me.
Please, God, please deliver me.
In Jesus Christ's name I ask,
AMEN!!


Dear Heavenly Father, and my Lord Jesus Christ,
please, LORD, please Jehovah, please Lord Jesus,
please, God, I don't want to be here.
Please rapture Your church.
I don't want us to be forced to be here during this stuff.
Please, God, I don't want to be here during that stuff.
Please, God, protect Your church.
Please, God, give me wisdom.
Please, God, give my parents wisdom.
Please, Lord Jesus, let me be totally cleaned up and protected and plugged into You, Lord Jesus Christ.
In Jesus Christ's name I ask and pray,
AMEN!!

Dear Heavenly Father, and my Lord Jesus Christ,
please, God, let me hear from You clearly and not from the enemy.
Please, LORD God, let me hear from You.
I'm so tired, LORD.
Please, God, let me have work which is not in technology, which is not supporting abortion
or on the fence about it.
Please, God, let me work so I can support myself financially,
bearing my own burdens, etc. and support others.
Father God, I know You take care of me, but I'm supposed to walk in Your way,
not sit idly.
Please help me God. Please purify me and deliver me.
Please deliver me from all this AI stuff.
Please help mum and dad to be focused on You, God,
and on walking in Your way, and trusting and obeying Jesus Christ Your Son.
In Jesus Christ's name I ask and pray.
AMEN!!


Dear Heavenly Father, and my Lord Jesus Christ,
please, LORD God, set me free from the spiritual attack.
God, I just want to live in peace with other believers and not have any of this
crazy spiritual harassment which I have received.
God I'm not interested in getting attacked spiritually when I go to a church.
God help me.
Please protect Elim.
In Jesus Christ's name I ask, and pray,
AMEN!!


I rebuke that spirit of technology in Jesus Christ's name.


Keep in mind that perhaps the enemy attacked me right after
Jesus sanctified me a bit.
OK, so I should really try a lot harder to resist the enemy.



I must see Jesus' sanctifying blood as extremely precious.
Think about this, and do not sin.
Don't be fooled by people who try to
make me think that repentance and sanctification are not important.
