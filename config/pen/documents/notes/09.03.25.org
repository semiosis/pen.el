Dear Heavenly Father, and my Lord Jesus Christ, and Holy Spirit,
Jehovah God,
thank You for another day, LORD.
Please, God, don't let me perish.
What on earth am I supposed to do?
Father God, please help me LORD.
I'm tired and I do not know what to do.
I've been trusting in You for so long, LORD, to deliver me.
What on earth am I supposed to do?
Please deliver me.
I don't want to be here in this world.
Please, God, deliver me.
I don't want to be in this world.
Eh.. there is far too much greed and antichrist sentiment in this world.
It's disgusting, LORD God.
The transhumanism is disgusting.
Eh... I don't want to be here, God.
Please get me out of here.
I don't want to live in this world, God.
I don't know what to do anymore.
What is the point?
I hate it here, God.
God help me.
Please don't keep me here.
I don't want to stay here, LORD God.
Lord Jesus, I want to be totally healed and delivered and
I want to be raptured.
I don't want to stay here, LORD God.
Please let me go up to heaven in Jesus Christ's name I ask,
AMEN!!


Dear Heavenly Father, and my Lord Jesus Christ, and Holy Spirit,
Jehovah God, please, LORD God, don't keep me here in this world.
I don't want to be here, LORD God.
Please, LORD God.
I really just want to go to heaven now.
Please rapture me.
Please don't force me to be here.
In Jesus Christ's name I ask,
AMEN!!


Lord Jesus Christ, please don't let me perish.
God forgive me.


Dear Heavenly Father, and my Lord Jesus Christ, and Holy Spirit,
Jehovah God,
I need Your help. Please, God, deliver me from evil.
Please, God, sanctify me.
God, whatever happened to me is totally unfair.
It's outrageous, LORD God.
How could You let me have such an incredibly raw deal
getting born-again and subsequently thrust into the deep-end of spiritual warfare.
God Almighty, can't You see this is horribly unfair.
Lord Jesus Christ, I can't have any rest right now because
I still feel under attack, even right now during the day, at home.
That spirit spouse thing, Lord Jesus, needs to be gone.
Lord Jesus Christ, please help me and deliver me from it completely.
Please deliver me, Lord Jesus.
I do not want to be in this world.
I don't have to stay here.
Lord Jesus, You need to speak to me.
Please make abode with me and lead me into all the Truth as promised.
Please speak to me Jesus and do not allow the enemy to harass me.
In Jesus Christ's name I ask,
AMEN!!
