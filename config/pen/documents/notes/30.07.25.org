I feel very tired.
I feel so, so tired.
I feel like something is attacking my mind and my soul.
It's not nice at all.
There's both an unnatural tingling sensation on my tongue and genitals,
and a ringing in my head that have been affecting me today.


Dear Heavenly Father, and my Lord Jesus Christ and Holy Spirit,
Jehovah, Almighty God,
I do not understand why I'm dealing with awful spiritual problems.
The spiritual defilement is draining.
Lord Jesus Christ, please help me, God.
Lord Jesus Christ, please forgive me.
