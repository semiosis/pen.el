Dear Heavenly Father, and my Lord Jesus Christ, and Holy Spirit,
Almighty Jehovah God,
please, LORD God, help the lady who runs the My Lovely Jesus ministry to hear clearly from You.
Please, LORD God, help her to continue her ministry and to not be afraid, LORD God, of the enemy and the enemy's attacks and the enemy's evil plans.
Please, LORD God, help her to continue being a prophetic voice for Your words.
Please, LORD God, help her to discern Your voice.
Please, LORD God, help her to walk in Your ways, and maintain a good conscience with You, being trusting, obedient, and faithful to You, LORD God, and testing the spirits to see whether they are from You.
In Jesus Christ's name I ask,
AMEN!!


Dear Heavenly Father, and my Lord Jesus Christ, and Holy Spirit,
Jehovah God,
please, LORD God, do not destroy me.
Please, LORD God, do not destroy me.
Please heal me LORD God.
I'm sorry for my sin and my shortcomings.
Please, LORD God, and I really do not want to be in this world.
Please, God, help Ryan and Sam to reconcile in Jesus Christ's name I ask.
I love them both. They're both believers in Jesus, LORD.
I know You love them both, LORD.
I think they could use a bit of reconciliation, LORD God, and find the common ground.
Please, LORD God, love on them in Jesus Christ's name I ask.
Please shower them with Your love God, and soften their hearts.
Please help them to just trust in You and be obedient trusters of You.
In Jesus Christ's name I ask,
AMEN!!


God I am so sorry for being impatient.
I've been scared, LORD God.
I'm scared of sin.
I'm so sorry LORD God, for having impure thoughts.
God forgive me.
God, I need You to clean my heart.
I want to be made holy and useful for You, LORD God.
