Dear Heavenly Father, Jehovah God,
I'm convinced that satan set up a situation where I had to choose
between Amelia and honouring Jesus.
Now, I want to be delivered right now in Jesus Christ's name.
Please, God, deliver me from the demons which have been harassing me.
Please, God, deliver me from the anti-marriage spirit.
Please, God, I *need* You to deliver me.
LORD God, please help me.
What has happened to me, against me, is pure darkness - it's pure, unrestrained evil.
Please, God, in Jesus Christ's name, deliver me for Your glory.
Please, God, in Jesus Christ's name, deliver me now because I'm suffering right now.
Please, LORD, help me right now.
In Jesus Christ's name I ask,
AMEN!!


Dear Heavenly Father, Jehovah God,
please, LORD, deliver me from these demons which have been harassing me.
Please, God, in Jesus Christ's name deliver me.
Just deliver me please, God.
Please don't wait. Every moment delaying is causing me to get irate.
Please, then, do not wait, but deliver me immediately.
Just deliver me in Jesus Christ's name please I ask,
AMEN!!
