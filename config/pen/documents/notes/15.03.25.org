Dear Heavenly Father and my Lord Jesus Christ, and Holy Spirit,
Jehovah God, Almighty God,
please deliver me from this masturbation spirit.
Please deliver me from this thing causing my genitals to be aroused.
And also, more importantly, LORD God, please bring my old friend Shaun Lowry to faith in You through Jesus Christ, I ask.
In Jesus Christ's name I ask,
AMEN!!


Dear Heavenly Father and my Lord Jesus Christ, and Holy Spirit,
Jehovah God, Almighty God
Lord Jesus Christ,
please do not let the enemy steal my marriage.
God, it feels as though You've already let my entire life get utterly defiled and destroyed
by allowing me to be attacked so much by demons, and by allowing the events of 2022 (going to court over the marriage proposal) to take place.
Please, God, deliver me from the evil and restore things to me.
Please, God, let me be delivered from the defilements which have come against me.
Please, God, deliver me from the abominations and spiritual wickedness which has come against me.
In Your precious name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, I ask.
Lord Jesus Christ, if You do not do this, if You do not deliver me, then it will be defiling to me.
It will defile my conscience if You do not deliver me.
Please do not leave me in a defiled state by not delivering me.
This is Your choice, Lord Jesus Christ.
You made the situation - You must have had it planned out.
The events of 2022 which I was forced into is a greater abomination than anything I can conceive of.
It's absolutely disgusting what has happened to me.
Please, God, in Jesus Christ's name deliver me.
AMEN!!


Dear Heavenly Father, and my Lord Jesus Christ, and Holy Spirit,
Jehovah God, Almighty Maker of Heaven and Earth,
Lord Jesus Christ, You allowed my marriage proposal and body and soul and mind to be attacked and derailed by demons.
That's absolutely disgusting.
Why don't You do something to rectify this problem?
Why don't You do something helpful to fix this Lord Jesus?
Help me in Your precious name please.
What has happened to me as a consequence of putting You first is the destruction of marriage and the defilement of my body.
What type of deal is that?
That's absolutely horrendous, Lord Jesus. You instituted marriage.
I trust in Your Word.
The Bible says, seek first the Kingdom of God and His righteousness and all these things will be added - so add them, please.
In Jesus Christ's name I ask,
AMEN!!


Dear Heavenly Father, and my Lord Jesus Christ, and Holy Spirit,
Jehovah God,
the depression which has come from having what happened to me happen is so destructive.
Please, God, can You just do something.
I'm waiting for You to do something.
Please let me see You do something.
If You have love for the brethren You will do something.
Lord Jesus, if You can't support people who are trying to live righteously following You,
then the scripture which says, "and the Lord is able to make him stand" is not true.
I need You to help me.
I need You to uphold me.
I want You to uphold me when I make the assertion that marriage comes before job.
Otherwise the faith is a really bad joke and there is no power behind righteousness.
For example, the prayer of a righteous person has no power if You can't uphold me as I stand for righteousness,
even the righteousness of not wanting to put my faith in money, and the righteousness of trusting You.
Lord Jesus Christ, I need You to do something and I need to deliver me and You should do it for Your own namesake,
since I have put my trust in You, and I have put my trust in You to deliver me.
Please don't let myself and You be put to shame.
In Jesus Christ's name I ask,
AMEN!!

It's really awful, LORD God.

In Jesus Christ's name I ask,
because Jesus bled and died for my sins and was raised for my justification.

please, God, forgive me.

Please, God, deliver me in Jesus Christ's name.
Please, God, I want to be praying for others and serving others but the sheer amount of spiritual attack I have had
has really been undermining my joy and morale.
God I haven't even been able to leave my parents' house.
God, I don't understand.
I just want to be healed, LORD.
It's too intense, LORD.
It's too intense.
Please, God, let me rest and be protected.
Please, God, don't force me to do this on my own.
I don't want to be here, LORD.
I don't want to be in this world at all.
God I'm pushed beyond my ability to function properly
because my joy is so undermined.
God help me please.
In Jesus Christ's name I ask,
AMEN!!
