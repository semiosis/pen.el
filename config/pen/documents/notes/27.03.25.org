Darn it, I'm still getting massively attacked in my genitals and in my mind.
It sucks!
God, I hate what is happening to me.
I rebuke it in Jesus Christ's name.



Dear Heavenly Father, and my Lord Jesus Christ, and Holy Spirit,
Jehovah God,
please, LORD God, in Jesus Christ's name deliver me from this world.
AMEN!!


Remember Simon's delusion (in my opinion it was a very clear delusion).
He thought I was throwing away God's plan, thinking that God's plan was for me to be working in Perth permanently.
I think that it's not right to presume that "getting that job in Perth" was God's plan.
God's ways are higher than our ways.
So God's "no plan B" just means He is working everything together for good (for those who love Him, anyway).
Some very strange stuff happened.


Remember what happened to me when I went to Perth.
It was as if I was cast out and put over there.
I had said that I wanted to be with people I love, that my heart was in Dunedin.

It definitely seemed right that I came back to Dunedin.
I maintain that it was definitely the right move.
Consider that remaining over there may well have cemented me in this apocalyptic technology future.
God Almighty, Lord Jesus Christ, can't You see what has happened to me?
I have been refused what is right to allow me to have, and only provided what would push me into the world.
And Lord Jesus, You made me born-again and saved me, but the powers that be still try to force me back into the world and into technology.

Help me Jesus.
Deliver me please, Jesus.
I have put my trust in You.
Please don't let me down, LORD.


*Sigh*.
God Almighty, please help me.
I don't understand why You've left me here and allowed me to come under so much spiritual attack.
God, this place is a personal hell.
Can You please, LORD, help me?


Dear Heavenly Father, and my Lord Jesus Christ, and Holy Spirit,
Jehovah God,
LORD God, could You please clear things up for me?
In Jesus Christ's name I ask,
AMEN!!


Dear Heavenly Father, and my Lord Jesus Christ, and Holy Spirit,
Jehovah God,
could You please cut me some slack, God?
Please, I would really appreciate it if You would protect me from evil.
I almost always go to bed trusting in You and hoping that You're going to keep me safe.
But, LORD, I've been viciously attacked by evil during my sleep or when I am awake.
I need Your help, LORD God.
Please, God, help me in Jesus Christ's name I ask.
Please, God, deliver me from those damned Wakari demons.
Please, God, deliver me from all satanic attack.
Please help me God.
Please guide me and correct me.
I'm very unhappy with remaining here.
LORD God, I really feel like You need to do something.
I need to be healed.
I want to be healed, set free and delivered from demons immediately in Jesus Christ's name.
Lord Jesus Christ, I need Your help.
Please, LORD Jesus, tonight let it be the day where You deliver me, in Jesus Christ's name I ask.
I won't accept dream or vision as authoritative unless a convincing confession of Jesus Christ is made.
Please, God, in Jesus Christ's name deliver me I ask,
AMEN!!


Dear Heavenly Father, and my Lord Jesus Christ, and Holy Spirit,
Jehovah God,
please help me, God.
Please, God, in Jesus Christ's name heal me.
Heal me, LORD God, in Jesus Christ's name I ask.
Please, LORD God, make the evil stop, LORD God.
Please, LORD God, deliver me from this demonic harassment.
Please, God, help me.
LORD God, it's Your duty to take care of me while I'm trusting in You.
It's Your duty, LORD God.
My duty is to fear You and keep Your commandments, particular those You've given us through Jesus Christ, Your Son, Father God.
Your duty then is to take care of me as I keep Your commandments.
LORD God, please, I need You to clean me and rescue me.
Please deliver me from this satanic oppression.
Please, God, I can't accept demons being allowed to assail my soul.
I need You to deliver me.
Deliver me, LORD God, do it now I ask in Jesus Christ's name, and keep me delivered and set free from demonic harassment, LORD God, I ask,
in Jesus Christ's name I ask and pray, because He died for me, and rose from the dead.
Lord Jesus Christ, Your blood was shed for me.
I believe in You.
Please rescue me, LORD God.
In Jesus Christ's name I ask.
Also, LORD God, rescue Stuart Ryan.
Please deliver him from sin and ignorance, and please grant him repentance to life.
Please grant him a close relationship with You, LORD God.
Please walk with him. Please sanctify him. Please, LORD God, bring him to the full stature of a Christian,
bring him to maturity in Christ, LORD God.
Complete Your work in him I ask.
Also, with Chris, from the street, LORD God, please set him free from demons I ask in Jesus Christ's name.
Please set him free from demonic harassment and satanic oppression.
Please help him to focus on You and please drive out the enemy.
Please protect him from demons.
Likewise, with Gareth and with Darryn.
Please, LORD God, protect them, heal them, sanctify them, correct them, deliver them, and set their feet on solid rock and
bring their faith and sanctification to completion.
Please make these guys like Jesus.
In Jesus Christ's name I ask,
AMEN!!


Dear Heavenly Father, and my Lord Jesus Christ, and Holy Spirit,
Jehovah God,
I do not know why I'm in this situation.
I don't understand.
I don't understand, LORD, why You've allowed the enemy to harass me so much.
LORD God, I don't know why You've allowed the enemy to come between me and my parents at times.
LORD God, I do not understand these things.
I do not understand, LORD God.
Please help me.
I can't have any spiritual attack against my body.
If You allow it to happen then it very much seems like to me that You're giving me a death sentence after I have been doing my best to follow Jesus.
Please, LORD God, put as top to when people critcise me when I say I'm trying to follow Jesus, as if being obedient to You is contrary to having faith in You, which it is not.
Please, God, in Jesus Christ's name set me free from that.
Help me, God, in Jesus Christ's name I ask.
I do not want the enemy harassing me as the enemy does, to the extent that I get harassment.
I'm very tired of being pushed around, LORD God, by what feels like spiritual turbulence.
Please help me God in Jesus Christ's name.
Please set me free from that damned thing which touches my legs and genitals.
Please set me free from it in Jesus Christ's name I ask.
Almighty God, help me, LORD, please, in Jesus Christ's name I ask,
AMEN!!
