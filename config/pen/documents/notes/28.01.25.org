Dear Heavenly Father, and my Lord Jesus Christ,
even though You don't speak to me clearly the way You spoke to Samuel,
and allow me to be attacked by all sorts of demons,
I know that I still have my faith in You.
Rather, amongst the dreams and visions, perhaps You did speak to me.
Please, God, clean me in Jesus Christ's name I ask,
and allow me to hear from You clearly.
I'm really tired of being attacked by demons.
Come on, LORD God.
Can't You just deliver me from this stuff?
Please deliver me in the name of Jesus Christ.
Please, God, help me.
In Jesus Christ's name I ask,
AMEN!!


There was one, I remember regarding Nellie's old house location.
And it seemed as though satan tried to have a conversation with me
but I may have answered him correctly.
I got an accusation against me.
There has been some strange stuff going on.
Another beastiality vision.
It's so disgusting.
Another age of empires vision.
I'm so tired of this crap.
I rebuke those demonic spirits in Jesus Christ's name.
