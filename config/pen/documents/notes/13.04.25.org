Jehovah God,
LORD God, please keep me safe.
I love You, LORD God.
I want to do Your will.
Lord Jesus, what the enemy meant for evil, please turn around for good.

I love You, LORD God.
Thank You, God, for saving me.
Please continue to deliver me from evil in Jesus Christ's name I ask,
AMEN!!


Dear Heavenly Father, and my Lord Jesus Christ, and Holy Spirit,

Please, LORD God, help me to honour You.
Please, LORD God, help me to forget the things which I feel like I can't deal with.
Please, LORD God, support Rudy.
