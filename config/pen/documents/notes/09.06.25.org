  Dear Heavenly Father and my Lord Jesus Christ and Holy Spirit,
  Yahweh, Jehovah, Almighty God,
  why did this happen to me?
  Why am I still being put through tribulation,
  and why am I still being tested through my parents?
  You are not a liar, LORD God.
  You are not a liar.
  Call every man a liar, but God true.
  I simply do not understand everything fully.
  In a way, Your Holy Spirit has already made testimony of Jesus through the Holy Scripture.
  What I have wanted and asked for is a direct confession *to me* through Your Spirit, in my heart, without technology, without the material, without paper, that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, who has come into the world, in the flesh, because that is how I understand is the promise that [[https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%2015%3A26&version=ESV][John 15:26]] speaks of.
  I want to hear this testimony from my heart.
  I want to know, know, know that the Holy Spirit has spoken to me.
  I have received testimony through Your Holy Scripture, but I want testimony directly through Your Spirit apart from the material world.
  Please, God, speak to me in this way, but Your will be done.
  In Jesus Christ's name, I ask,
  AMEN!!

I recognize that I am a sinner and still need God to justify me through faith in Jesus Christ, not of my own works. I do not believe that 'works' exactly equals 'obedience', but I believe that Jesus has commanded us to have faith in Him:

  *[[https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%203%3A3-6&version=ESV][Romans 3:3-6]]* - What if some were unfaithful? Does their faithlessness nullify the faithfulness of God? By no means! *Let God be true though every one were a liar*, as it is written, That you may be justified in your words, and prevail when you are judged. But if *our unrighteousness serves to show the righteousness of God*, what shall we say? That God is unrighteous to inflict wrath on us? (I speak in a human way.) By no means! For then how could God judge the world? (ESV)

  *[[https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%203%3A21-28&version=ESV][Romans 3:21-28]]* - But now the righteousness of God has been manifested apart from the law, although the Law and the Prophets bear witness to it — *the righteousness of God through faith in Jesus Christ for all who believe*. For there is no distinction: for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God, and are justified by his grace as a gift, through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus, whom God put forward as a propitiation by his blood, to be received by faith. This was to show God's righteousness, because in his divine forbearance he had passed over former sins. It was to show his righteousness at the present time, so that he might be just and the justifier of the one who has faith in Jesus. Then what becomes of our boasting? It is excluded. By what kind of law? By a law of works? No, but by the law of faith. For we hold that one is justified by faith apart from works of the law. (ESV)
