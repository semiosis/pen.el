Dear Heavenly Father, and my Lord Jesus Christ, and Holy Spirit,
Jehovah God,
hallowed be Your Name.
Your Kingdom come, Your Will be done on earth as it is done in heaven.
Please give us this day our daily bread.
Please forgive us of our sins as we have forgiven and forgive those who
have sinned against us.
Please lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil.
Yours is the Kingdom, the power and the glory,
forever and ever,
AMEN!!


Dear Heavenly Father, and my Lord Jesus Christ, and Holy Spirit,
Jehovah God,
LORD God, please deliver me, God.
I need deliverance.
I do not know why I'm under attack even now.
Please, LORD God, make this orgasm spirit go away in Jesus Christ's name I ask.
LORD God, I renounce it and I rebuke it.
LORD God, please allow me to have a good conscience with You, and sound mind,
and peace and rest in my spirit, rest in You, LORD God, and not in impurity.
And Lord Jesus Christ, I sincerely do not appreciate the way in which You've allowed the devil to harass me ongoingly.
Please make that stop in Your precious name of Jesus Christ, Son of God, I ask.
AMEN!!


Dear Heavenly Father, and my Lord Jesus Christ and Holy Spirit,
Jehovah God,
Please forgive me, LORD God, for masturbating this morning.
God, I don't know how to make spiritual impurity go away, asides from following Jesus and walking in the light.
God, I try, but there's something truly pitch black evil which has been attacking my soul - this orgasm spirit, etc, and the false, lying dreams.
Please deliver me in Jesus Christ's name I ask,
AMEN!!


Lord Jesus Christ,
thank You for the gift of eternal life in You, LORD.
I believe.
Lord Jesus Christ,
I want to be holy, LORD God.
I want to be holy, LORD God.
I believe that You are God.
I'm sorry, God.
I don't understand.
I don't understand what's been going on, and I feel like it got too much.
