Dear Heavenly Father and my Lord Jesus Christ, and Holy Spirit,
Jehovah, Almighty God,
I want to continue to be used for Your purposes.
God Almighty, I'm really tired.
I'm really sorry, LORD.
Lord Jesus Christ, You are Saviour and You are Lord and You are God, and yes, LORD God, You love Your neighbour.
Father God has commanded us to do the same.
In Jesus Christ's name, I pray,
AMEN!!

Dear Heavenly Father and my Lord Jesus Christ and Holy Spirit,
Jehovah, Almighty God,
please forgive me, LORD, if I have been wrong.
God, I love people.
But I don't love sin.
I really don't love sin at all.
But I love people.
God, yes, mercy, justice and faithfulness are surely the weightier matters of the law.
Yes, it's true.
But I also recognise that inheriting the kingdom requires that a person be sanctified to be holy.
Yes, I recognise this.
Please, God, forgive me.
Lord Jesus Christ, You know I love these people.
And they do demonstrate kindness and respect to others.
Yes, they do. But at the same time indulge in sexual sin.
God help me.
I do not want to be a hypocrite.
I want to be cleansed from sexual sin, LORD.
I truly do.
Being amongst it though doesn't help me in my efforts to be cleaned from it.
Please help me God in Jesus Christ's name, I ask.
And have mercy on those people who still "have sin" but do demonstrate (perhaps with a lower standard of holiness) the golden rule.
In Jesus Christ's name I ask and pray,
AMEN!!


Dear Heavenly Father and my Lord Jesus Christ, and Holy Spirit,
Jehovah, Almighty God,
Father God, I'm terrified of finding myself under wrath.
Please, Lord Jesus, don't let me be destroyed.
Father God, I believe Jesus Christ died for my sins, that I can be set free from sin and live for what's right.
Please, God, set me free from sexual sin, LORD, and other sin.
Please, LORD God, let me have holiness.
Please, LORD God, let me be happy with the outcome of the sanctification You give me.
Please, LORD God, let me feel like You're my friend.
But at the same time, LORD God, let me have dignity.
And, please, LORD God, have mercy on these people.
And, please, God, be merciful to all these sinners who have fear of God and who are to the weightier matters of the law, law-abiding.
In Jesus Christ's name, I ask,
AMEN!!


Lord Jesus Christ, You're killing me.
You're killing me by not delivering me.


By holding me in this position You are not honouring my renouncing of sin.
Asking people to renouncing and forsake sin is a farce if You do not empower people to be set free from it.


I'm not happy that You have not set me free yet.


Father God, I'm not OK with being held in a situation which is not conducive to holiness.
I'm not OK with it.
If You are truly Jehovah Jireh, then You will provide for me an environment which is conducive to holy living.
If You are truly Jehovah, then You will All-powerfully be faithful to Your Word.
I am not happy with what has been happening to me.
As far as I can tell, Your church is corrupt.


Lord Jesus Christ, I feel spiritually sick.
LORD Jesus Christ, LORD God Jehovah, Holy Spirit, Father God, Jesus Christ,
please, God, deliver me.
God Almighty, I do not feel well anymore.
I do not feel well.


* TODO Make a point of this in the faith and judgement document
The word "end" doesn't mean abolishment. It means more like "ultimate" or "fulfillment" or in context it means "final say".
So for those who believe, the free gift of righteousness that comes from God ultimately has the final say in judgement. In other words, the righteousness that is not of themselves but available through faith in Christ based on His work alone has the ultimate say and also is the foundation for any other righteousness.

  *Romans 10:11-15* - For the Scripture says, Everyone who believes in him will not be put to shame. For there is no distinction between Jew and Greek; the same Lord is Lord of all, bestowing his riches on all who call on him. For everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved. But how are they to call on him in whom they have not believed? And how are they to believe in him of whom they have never heard? And how are they to hear without someone preaching? And how are they to preach unless they are sent? As it is written, How beautiful are the feet of those who preach the good news! (ESV)

Dear Heavenly Father, please help me.
I want to be totally set free from sin, sanctified, and I don't want to feel spiritually unwell, but I want to be able to live in freedom,
and I feel as though that in condemning the evil goal and practices that others have had with the AI stuff, now it leaves me feeling no longer
free to think properly.
Lord Jesus Christ, I need help.
Holy Spirit, I need help.
Father God, I need help.
Please set me free in Jesus Christ's name, I ask,
AMEN!!

** I'm so tired it's not funny

Jesus Christ, please help me.

** 
Lord Jesus Christ, I entrusted my life to You.
I entrusted You with my wellbeing as I have given up almost everything to serve You.
God help me, I'm not going to give things up unnecessarily.
For example, should I give up breathing?
For what?
We're supposed to give things up only in obedient to You, not simply give things up arbitrarily.
What is to be given up typically is in order to give mercy to others who are in need of it or if the thing being given up is sin then it is to give it up to instead treasure the truth.

Lord Jesus Christ, don't let me down.
Please be real.
Please let my faith not be futile.
Please just for the love of God just speak to me.
Speak to me, LORD.

Lord Jesus Christ, please, God, defend me, God.
