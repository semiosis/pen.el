Dear Heavenly Father and my Lord Jesus Christ and Holy Spirit,
Jehovah, Almighty God,
You haven't yet confessed to me by Your Holy Spirit the testimony of Jesus Christ,
and I certainly can't trust the goading of whatever antichrist spirit has been sending me dreams and visions,
and working through many people around me.
The Apostle John instructs me to not trust every spirit but to test the spirits to see whether they are from God.
Therefore, I will continue testing the spirits.
Every single spirit which refuses to confess Jesus *is not* from God.
Every single spirit which confesses Jesus Christ has come (from God) in the flesh *is* from God.
Lord Jesus Christ, I cannot trust any of the dreams and visions which I have received
because I have not heard the testimony through dreams and visions that Jesus Christ has come from God in the flesh
and neither does it seem to be the case that other people want to confess those words to me.
Lord Jesus Christ, I'm sick and tired of being harassed by demons.
I have the right to become a child of God and it appears as though I'm being denied that right.
But Lord Jesus Christ, I ask that You would be true to Your word and continue to sanctify me
and that You would not withhold from me whatever else I need, my daily bread.
Deliver me, Lord Jesus Christ from the spirit of antichrist in Jesus Christ's name, I ask,
AMEN!!

  *I John 4:1-3* - Beloved, do not believe every spirit, but test the spirits to see whether they are from God, for many false prophets have gone out into the world. By this you know the Spirit of God: every spirit that confesses that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is from God, and every spirit that does not confess Jesus is not from God. This is the spirit of the antichrist, which you heard was coming and now is in the world already. (ESV)
