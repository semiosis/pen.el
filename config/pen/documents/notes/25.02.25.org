Dear Heavenly Father,
and my Lord Jesus Christ,
Jehovah God,
please, LORD God, help Abigail and Karan to put their trust in You through Jesus.
Please, LORD God, help them to have faith in You, LORD God.
God forgive me and them.
I don't know what to do in this world anymore, LORD God.
God, I really don't want to be here.
In Jesus Christ's name I ask,
AMEN!!

I wonder how Abigail is going - she liked Ed Sheeran - so did Karan.

I'm so tired of this AI stuff invading my consciousness.
I just rebuke it in Jesus Christ's name.


Dear Heavenly Father, and my Lord Jesus Christ,
Jehovah God,
please deliver me from this world.
I do not want to be here with AI stuff creeping into my mind.
Please, LORD God, deliver me from this world.
I do not want to be here, LORD God.
Please, LORD God, don't force me to stay here.
Please rapture me.
LORD God, 
In Jesus Christ's name I ask,
AMEN!!


Sigh.. I was duped into listening to an AI generated Ed Sheeran song titled "I believe" which was called a gospel song.
I'm so tired of the AI stuff creeping into my consciousness.
I do not want that to continue.
I guess I could see it in the perspective (in a way) that the rocks are crying out, but I think I could only see it with positive light if I were maintaining my relationship with Jesus, committing my way to Him, and the AI stuff was being kept in check. I really just want Jesus to return. I don't want to be in AI world:

  *Luke 19:37-40* - As he was drawing near—already on the way down the Mount of Olives—the whole multitude of his disciples began to rejoice and praise God with a loud voice for all the mighty works that they had seen, saying, Blessed is the King who comes in the name of the Lord! Peace in heaven and glory in the highest! And some of the Pharisees in the crowd said to him, Teacher, rebuke your disciples. He answered, I tell you, if these were silent, the very stones would cry out. (ESV)

Can I fight this masturbation spirit / spirit spouse thing?
God Almighty help me.


Dear Heavenly Father, and my Lord Jesus Christ,
Jehovah God,
please, LORD God, don't keep me in this world.
I feel corrupted.
I don't want to be here.
I need to have freedom.
Please let me leave this place.
I don't want to stay here in the world.
Please, LORD God, deliver me from these harassing, tormenting demons.
Please help me, God, in Jesus Christ's name I ask.
Please help me, God, in Jesus Christ's name I ask.
I need You to open doors for me.
I need You to deliver me from evil, harassing dreams and visions.
I need You to deliver me from satanic harassment.
Please, LORD God, in Jesus Christ's name, deliver me.
AMEN!!


Dear Heavenly Father, and my Lord Jesus Christ,
Jehovah God,
please, LORD, don't keep me here in this world.
I don't like being here with the AI stuff.
Everything seems pointless.
Please smack down the AI stuff and destroy it.
In Jesus Christ's name I ask,
AMEN!!
