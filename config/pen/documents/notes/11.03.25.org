Dear Heavenly Father, and my Lord Jesus Christ, and Holy Spirit,
Jehovah God,
praise You, LORD, for everything You've done in my life.
Thank You for Your salvation.
Please, God, lead me not into temptation but deliver me from evil.
Please, Lord Jesus, deliver me from this "spirit spouse" stuff
and from the masturbation stuff.
Please help me to sleep.
In Jesus Christ's name I ask.
AMEN!!


Please don't destroy me, LORD God.


Dear Heavenly Father, and my Lord Jesus Christ, and Holy Spirit,
please, LORD God, do not allow the body of sin, the flesh, to
control me. Please, God, put it to death.
In Jesus Christ's name I ask,
AMEN!!


Dear Heavenly Father, and my Lord Jesus Christ,
and Holy Spirit, Jehovah God,
Lord Jesus, You are amazing.
Your will be done, LORD God.
Thank You for helping me.
Please help me to put sin to death.
Please make me pure and holy.
Please help me to bring holiness to completion.
In Jesus Christ's name I ask,
AMEN!!


I love You, Lord Jesus Christ.
You're the boss.
You're the King of Kings and Lord of Lords.
I'm really sorry for letting you down at times.


Dear Heavenly Father, and my Lord Jesus Christ,
and Holy Spirit,
Jehovah God,
I love You, LORD.
I truly love You.
But I feel broken, and things feel very unstable.
LORD God, I want to do what You want me to do.
But I just need stability and healing.
I need deliverance and healing, LORD God.
I don't feel well.
How could I possibly be a pastor?
I would love it if I were clean and well, and able.
But I honestly don't feel well, and clean and able.
I'm so sorry, LORD God.
Please, LORD God, deliver me and heal me and make me clean.
I can't live without Your assistance.
I wish I was able to focus better on You right now,
but it just seems like I'm always forced to focus on spiritual warfare.
Please, God, I need a rescue.
Please rescue me and heal me LORD God.
In Jesus Christ's name I ask and pray,
AMEN!!


Dear Heavenly Father, and my Lord Jesus Christ, and Holy Spirit,
Jehovah God,
Your will be done, LORD.
God, I'm so sorry.
I feel as though I have messed things up so much.
God I need Your help.
Lord Jesus, please, God, I need You to rescue me so I'm back at that place where
I feel like I'm honoring You and where it doesn't feel like I'm dying.
God, I don't know what this thing is which has been attacking me with false, abusive dreams and visions.
But I need to be rescued from it.
Please rescue me.
In Jesus Christ's name I ask,
AMEN!!


My body, soul, mind and spirit belong to Father God, Jesus Christ Son of God, and Holy Spirit.


Dear Heavenly Father, and my Lord Jesus Christ, and Holy Spirit,
Jehovah God,
God, I just want to be clean and healed and in a really good relationship with You, LORD.
God, I do not understand it all.
God, I'm severely limited as someone who is simply trying to work things out, and be corrected by Your Word.
Please, LORD, forgive and correct me.
In Jesus Christ's name I ask,
AMEN!!
