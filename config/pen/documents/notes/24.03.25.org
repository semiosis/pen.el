Dear Heavenly Father, and my Lord Jesus Christ, and Holy Spirit,
Jehovah God,
please, LORD God, deliver me.
I can't live like this, being tormented by demons.
Please, LORD God Almighty, Jehovah God, Lord Jesus Christ,
deliver me.
God, it's very much unacceptable that I've been getting attacked as I have been getting attacked.
In Jesus Christ's name I ask,
AMEN!!


Every night, harassing dreams, and spiritual attack against my private parts.
Absolutely, disgusting stuff.
Lord Jesus Christ, what on earth?
Why don't You rescue me?
