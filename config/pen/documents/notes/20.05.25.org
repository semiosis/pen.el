Dear Heavenly Father, and my Lord Jesus Christ, and Holy Spirit,
Jehovah God,
please, LORD God, deliver me from evil in Jesus Christ's name.
Please, God, don't keep me going through what feels like endless tribulation.
The marriage proposal I made should certainly not be in any way coupled with LGBT.
Please, God, in Jesus Christ's name make the homosexuality and sexual immorality go away in Jesus Christ's name.
Please, God, in Jesus Christ's name, deliver me from being in what feels like a spiritual prison.
Please, God, in Jesus Christ's name decouple me from the evil.
Make the evil go away in Jesus Christ's name.
Please, God, in Jesus Christ's name, please God, just deliver me from the spiritual prison and the spiritual attack.
Please deliver me, God, in Jesus Christ's name.
I am not an idolator.
I don't love Melee more than You, God.
I don't.
Please, help me, God.
Please, You can't ask me to deny what is true.
I want to do Your will, LORD God.
I want to be delivered, LORD God.
I want to hear from You, LORD God.
Please, Jesus, let me hear from You.
Please, Jesus, set me free from this anti-marriage stuff, God,
and please set me free from the LGBT stuff, LORD God.
Please, if delivering me from evil involves rapturing me then so be it, LORD God.
I have no idea what Amelia believes or things.
Help me, LORD Jesus Christ.
Please, God, You expect me to walk in Your ways.
Please don't deny what You expect me to do.
Please don't deny what is good, God.
Please don't make me renounce what is good.
Father God, I've been pushed to the point where the pressure on me I feel like has been extremely corrupting.
I want to be delivered from evil.
I don't want to be corrupted by evil.
Please make the evil go away.
Please deliver me, God.
Please deliver me, God.
Please deliver me in Jesus Christ's name, I ask.
Please speak to me clearly, LORD God.
Please guide me, and continue using me for Your purposes.
Your will be done.
Your kingdom come, LORD God.
Deliver me, LORD God, in Jesus Christ's name I ask,
AMEN!!


Dear Heavenly Father, and my Lord Jesus Christ, and Holy Spirit,
Jehovah God,
unless You tell me specifically and directly by an angel, that I'm allowed to marry Melee, along with an acknowledgement of the true facts about Jesus Christ,
I can't do anything.
Please, God, deliver me from evil, and speak to me reliably and directly.
In Jesus Christ's name I ask,
AMEN!!


Lord Jesus Christ, I hate my life so much, God.
I hate it so much.
How could I marry anyone in this state, LORD God?
I need You to set me free from all of that LGBT stuff, God.
I need You to set me free from the tyranny of the devil.
