Dear Heavenly Father, and my Lord Jesus Christ, and Holy Spirit,
Jehovah God,
Lord Jesus Christ, I need You.
I need Your help so badly.
I need Your help, LORD.
I don't want to die.
Please, God, protect me.
I do not understand why what has happened has happened.
Please, LORD God, in Jesus Christ's name do a miracle and get me out of here.
In Jesus Christ's name I ask,
AMEN!!


Lord Jesus Christ, I need You to help me.
I need You to do a miracle.
I do not know why evil things have been allowed to attack me.
I've just wanted to obey Your commandments.
I feel really weak now.
Lord Jesus, Your words and commandments are spirit and they are life.
Lord Jesus Christ, they should not produce death.
Lord Jesus Christ, please help me because I don't understand why I'm suffering like this.
Lord Jesus Christ, please help me because I feel like I'm suffering because of obedience to You, Lord Jesus Christ.
I have tried my hardest.
Lord Jesus Christ, You didn't give me a fair run.
You didn't give me a fair go.
Please help me God in Jesus Christ's name I ask.
God Almighty, do not hide Yourself. Reveal Yourself, LORD God.
Do not let demons ravage my soul.
Do not let it happen, LORD God.
Instead, do the Truth, act according to Your Word and Your promises, LORD God.
Act according to integrity, and truthfulness and faithfulness and honor and power and glory.
Deliver me, LORD God.
Don't let me get terrorised and oppressed by demons any longer.
As I am attacked by demons, You do not show Yourself to be a good shepherd, since the Good Shepherd takes care of His sheep,
and it's very clear that I am not being taken care of when I am being attacked by demons.
Therefore, please, God, do what ought to be done and deliver me,
in Jesus Christ's name I ask and pray,
AMEN!!


I should add this:


This is the gift of God, eternal life. It's a great verse. I believe that I have this water of life. I believe I have it in me:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *John 4:10-14* - Jesus answered her, If you knew the gift of God, and who it is that is saying to you, Give me a drink, you would have asked him, and he would have given you living water. The woman said to him, Sir, you have nothing to draw water with, and the well is deep. Where do you get that living water? Are you greater than our father Jacob? He gave us the well and drank from it himself, as did his sons and his livestock. Jesus said to her, Everyone who drinks of this water will be thirsty again, but *whoever drinks of the water that I will give him will never be thirsty forever*. The water that I will give him will become in him a spring of water welling up to eternal life. (ESV)

I've got a river of life flowing out through me. It makes the lame to walk and the blind to see.
It opens prison doors and sets the captives free.
I've got a river of life flowing out of me.


I definitely think that I should not be *too* judgemental when it comes to Christian sects.


Father, God in Jesus Christ's name, please deliver me.
Jesus Christ is my Lord and my Saviour.
I believe what He said when He said that all who come to him will not hunger and all who believe in Him, out of their heart will flow rivers of living water bubbling up to eternal life.
Please, God, hear my prayer and deliver me from the evil which has been attacking me.
Don't let it continue.
I trust in You, LORD God.
Jehovah God, please deliver me in Jesus Christ's name I ask.
Lord Jesus, please help me.
Please completely deliver me from the evil which has been attacking me.
Please help me God.
I need Your help, LORD God.
I desperately need Your help.
Please make the demonic harassment cease immediately in Jesus Christ's name, I ask.
Please, God, deliver me in Jesus Christ's name, I ask.
AMEN!!


Dear Heavenly Father, and my Lord Jesus Christ, and Holy Spirit,
please, would You clear up everything for me?
Please, LORD God, would You clear it all up for me so I am not in darkness.
God, I just want to be in the light with You.
Please, Jesus, let me see things from Your perspective, God, even if just regarding my own situation.
Please tell me what it is that has happened to me, even if I'm at fault.
I just want to be in the truth, LORD God.
Please, God, let me be in the light as You are in the light.
In Jesus Christ's name I ask,
AMEN!!


Lord Jesus Christ, please, LORD God, let me be clean.
LORD, whatever You will for me to be, let me be that.
But, God, I want to be clean and holy as Your Holy Word says You also want.
Lord Jesus Christ, I love You, LORD.
Jehovah God, I love You, LORD.


Lord Jesus Christ, please keep helping me.
Please keep healing me.
Lord Jesus Christ, I confess I have masturbated today and that was sin.
I'd like to be able to confess stuff like this with people.
I need brothers in Christ I can confess the difficult stuff to.
Please forgive me LORD Jesus.
I believe that Your work in me will continue until the day of the Lord Jesus Christ, until Your day, Lord Jesus, LORD God.
