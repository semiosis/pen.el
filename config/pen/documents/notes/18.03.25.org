Dear Heavenly Father, and my Lord Jesus Christ, and Holy Spirit,
Jehovah God,
I want to be sanctified.
I am sorry for masturbating in the morning.
But, LORD, as I have been having faith in You for years
for a wife and You haven't provided one - worse, You
made me sacrifice a marriage proposal to someone
I love, my first ever marriage proposal - 
because You allowed that to happen, I masturbated.
It's Your fault, LORD God.
You haven't been providing adequately for me.
Please, LORD, in Jesus Christ's name,
provide adequately for me and give me some grace.
In Jesus Christ's name I ask,
AMEN!!


Dear Heavenly Father, and my Lord Jesus Christ, and Holy Spirit,
Jehovah God,
God, if You want satan to have control over marriages, then
do not grant me to have a wife.
Almighty God, it is a truly disgusting thought that You
would even allow satan to have control over marriages.
It makes me question if You are God.
You made mankind in Your image - male and female You made them.
If the blood of Jesus can't fix a marriage, then Jesus mustn't have been
a human being.
The blood of Jesus should be able to fix a marriage.
Jesus was perfect.
What is the problem?
Deliver me in Jesus Christ's name.
Deliver me in Jesus Christ's name.
Please, God, speak to me clearly and do not allow the enemy to harass me with
dreams that are not from You.
Just because a dream contained the name of Jesus in it
does not make it a true dream.
The dream must confess the truth about Jesus.
Deliver me in Jesus Christ's name.
AMEN!!


Dear Heavenly Father, and my Lord Jesus Christ, and Holy Spirit,
Jehovah God,
please, God, set me free from the masturbation stuff.
Please, God, set me free from it.
Whatever that spirit is which has been moving my genitals around;
It needs to stop.
It needs to stop in Jesus Christ's name.
God Almighty, if You have any grace in You for me,
please deliver me.
Please deliver me God.
In Jesus Christ's name please protect me at night time and deliver me.
AMEN!!

  *Ephesians 1:3-6* - Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us in Christ with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly places, even as he chose us in him before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy and blameless before him. In love he predestined us for adoption through Jesus Christ, according to the purpose of his will, to the praise of his glorious grace, with which he has blessed us in the Beloved. (ESV)
