Dear Heavenly Father and my Lord Jesus Christ, and Holy Spirit,
Jehovah God,
please, LORD God, please sanctify me completely.
Please don't let me die.
I want to be clean.
I want to be able to live righteously, in the way that You want me to live.
I want to feel clean.
I want my good conscience back.
I want my hope back.
Please, God, clean me again.
In Jesus Christ's name I ask,
AMEN!!


Dear Heavenly Father, and my Lord Jesus Christ and Holy Spirit,
Jehovah, Almighty God,
please, LORD God, whatever happens, do not let my dad go.
Father God, I don't understand.
I don't understand why .
