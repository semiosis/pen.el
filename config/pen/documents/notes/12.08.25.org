Thank You, LORD Jesus, for the encouragement today and letting me share my thoughts of my faith with Don, Ray, Neil and Xav and also with Elliot.
I'm sorry, Lord Jesus Christ for complaining so much.
I'm sorry, LORD.
I'm just afraid that I'd be left here in this world, and I'm scared of corruption.
I don't want to be here.
