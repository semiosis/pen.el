Dear Heavenly Father, and Lord Jesus Christ,
I'M EXTREMELY TIRED.
Please, God, in Jesus Christ's name, make this demonic harassment end immediately,
and please, God, in Jesus Christ's name, make a sound confession
by Your Holy Spirit, to me, confessing the facts about Jesus Christ,
that He is Your Only-Begotten Son who has come from You Father God,
to the earth in the flesh, died on a cross and rose again from the dead.
In Jesus Christ's name I ask,
AMEN!!


Dear Heavenly Father, and Lord Jesus Christ,
what has happened to me is not OK.
I expect Your Holy Spirit to confess to me that Jesus is the Christ,
Your Only-Begotten Son, Father God.
I expect You to do this.
If You do not do this then I might be talking to antichrist,
because the Scripture say that any spirit which does not confess Jesus
is not from God.
It's not OK for You to not confess Jesus to me, LORD.
You need to do it because You are not a liar.
You are Spirit, God, so You should confess this to me.
I've confessed it to You.
Please confess it to me.
Also, what has happened to me with the Dunedin court situation is not OK.
What has happened to me being denied marriage is not OK.
I need You to do something in Jesus Christ's name.
Please, God, in Jesus Christ's name begin doing something by speaking to me,
and making a confession about Jesus Christ.
To not do so in completely unjust and unacceptable.
In Jesus Christ's name I ask and pray,
AMEN!!


Dear Heavenly Father,
Being prevented from marrying is satanic and
it's disgusting and evil.
It's causing sin in my life to be forced not to marry.
I rebuke it in Jesus Christ's name.
Please, God, in Jesus Christ's name allow me to marry,
and destroy that perverted spirit which is preventing me from marrying.
Destroy it, LORD, please in Jesus Christ's name
or rapture me.
I do not want to be here.
Please, God, in Jesus Christ's name, use Your power
to do something to fix this situation.
I'm really sick of this.
Thanks God.
In Jesus Christ's name I pray,
AMEN!!


Dear Heavenly Father, Almighty God,
please, God, in Jesus Christ's name give me some mercy.
I'm sick of this constant persecution.
Please, God, in Jesus Christ's name, deliver me from the evil.
Please, God, in Jesus Christ's name, set me free.
Please, God, in Jesus Christ's name, actually speak to me and confess Jesus to me through Your Holy Spirit.
If You are Good and Truthful, You will do this, as Jesus has promised it.

  *John 14:15-21* - If you love me, you will keep my commandments. And I will ask the Father, and he will give you another Helper, to be with you forever, even the Spirit of truth, whom the world cannot receive, because it neither sees him nor knows him. You know him, for he dwells with you and will be in you. I will not leave you as orphans; I will come to you. Yet a little while and the world will see me no more, but you will see me. Because I live, you also will live. In that day you will know that I am in my Father, and you in me, and I in you. Whoever has my commandments and keeps them, he it is who loves me. And he who loves me will be loved by my Father, and I will love him and manifest myself to him. (ESV)

  *John 16:13* - When the Spirit of truth comes, he will guide you into all the truth, for he will not speak on his own authority, but whatever he hears he will speak, and he will declare to you the things that are to come. (ESV)

  *I John 4:4-21* - Little children, you are from God and have overcome them, for he who is in you is greater than he who is in the world. They are from the world; therefore they speak from the world, and the world listens to them. We are from God. Whoever knows God listens to us; whoever is not from God does not listen to us. By this we know the Spirit of truth and the spirit of error. Beloved, let us love one another, for love is from God, and whoever loves has been born of God and knows God. Anyone who does not love does not know God, because God is love. In this the love of God was made manifest among us, that God sent his only Son into the world, so that we might live through him. In this is love, not that we have loved God but that he loved us and sent his Son to be the propitiation for our sins. Beloved, if God so loved us, we also ought to love one another. No one has ever seen God; if we love one another, God abides in us and his love is perfected in us. By this we know that we abide in him and he in us, because he has given us of his Spirit. And we have seen and testify that the Father has sent his Son to be the Savior of the world. Whoever confesses that Jesus is the Son of God, God abides in him, and he in God. So we have come to know and to believe the love that God has for us. God is love, and whoever abides in love abides in God, and God abides in him. By this is love perfected with us, so that we may have confidence for the day of judgment, because as he is so also are we in this world. There is no fear in love, but perfect love casts out fear. For fear has to do with punishment, and whoever fears has not been perfected in love. We love because he first loved us. If anyone says, I love God, and hates his brother, he is a liar; for he who does not love his brother whom he has seen cannot love God whom he has not seen. And this commandment we have from him: whoever loves God must also love his brother. (ESV)
