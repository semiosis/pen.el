Dear Heavenly Father, and my Lord Jesus Christ,
Jehovah God,
please, LORD, I would prefer to not go back to what I have spat out.
Would You please be able to provide me with a way of moving forward which does not involve going back to Egypt?
Please, God, help Carl to be able to find work.
Please, God, sanctify both of us Shanes and both of the Carls in Your Truth, Your Word, and by obedience to it.
In Jesus Christ's name I ask,
AMEN!!


Dear Heavenly Father, and my Lord Jesus Christ,
Jehovah God,
please, God, in Jesus Christ's name,
take away that evil spirit of "orgasm" / "masturbation"
which keeps trying to make my body aroused.
It's absolutely disgusting.
Please, God, set me free.
I'm unable to work.
I'm unable to marry.
I'm unable, God, even to give to the poor because people say I'm in debt.
So many Christians simply tell me not to give to the poor etc.
I'm so sick of this evil.
Please, God, in Jesus Christ's name set me free.
I do not uderstand why this is happening.
Please, God, don't force me back into technology.
God help me.
I'm so sick and tired of this.
Set me free in Jesus Christ's name I ask,
AMEN!!
