I don't know what happened to me.
But I want to be delivered.


Dear Heavenly Father, and my Lord Jesus Christ,
Jehovah God,
please, LORD God, don't force me to stay here.
I just want to be raptured.
I really don't want to be here.
Please, God, make me clean.
I want to be clean and sanctified and holy and have none of these
burning, or arousing sensations on my tongue, my mouth, my chest or my loins,
and no strange movements in my loins and no strange dreams,
and no excommunication from various churches.
I do not understand why I've been excluded from churches,
and pushed around and slandered online, etc.
I've put up with a truly extreme amount of demonic harassment
and I want to be delivered from it all.
Please, God, in Jesus Christ's name deliver me from evil, and deliver me from this world.
Please, God, in Jesus Christ's name set me free.
Please, God, in Jesus Christ's name enable me to live without so much opposition.
It's so horrible, LORD.
Please, God, speak to me also.
In Jesus Christ's name I ask,
AMEN!!


Dear Heavenly Father, and my Lord Jesus Christ,
please, LORD, take care of Melee.
Please, LORD, bring her to totally faith and trust in You through Jesus Christ I ask.
Also, for her family.
Please, God, help us to heal completely from what has happened.
Please, God, in Jesus Christ's name do not force me to stay here.
I don't want to be here in this world, LORD God.
Please deliver me in Jesus Christ's name I ask,
AMEN!!


Dear Heavenly Father, and my Lord Jesus Christ,
thank You for saving me as I hold my faith in You.
I believe that You died for my sins, LORD, and rose again from the dead
3 days later.
Please, God, don't abandon me here.
Please, God, rescue me.
Please, don't abandon me here.
God Almighty. I have had such a crummy run with women and jobs etc.
Oh God why on earth do You allow me to be harassed by evil spirits?
God Almighty, why do You keep me here and not speak clearly to me?
Lord Jesus, if You are faithful then Your Holy Spirit will clearly testify of You to me.
If Your Holy Spirit doesn't do this then I don't know what to say/do
because You said Yourself that the Spirit of Truth would testify of You
and lead me into all the Truth.
So please, God, make sure that happens.
I want to hear it clear and now.
Lord Jesus Christ, please God, set me free from this evil age.
I'm trusting in You Lord Jesus.
I'm sorry for wanting to leave, God.
I don't want to be here in AI world.
Please get me out of here, Lord Jesus.
In Jesus Christ's name I ask,
AMEN!!
