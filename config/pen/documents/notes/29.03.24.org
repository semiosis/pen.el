Dear Heavenly Father, Jehovah God,
please forgive me.
Please, God, help me to have more faith in You.
Please forgive me for my mistakes and my failings, and my weaknesses.
Please, God, help me to remain holy in this world.
I hate the tribulation.
I hate being pressured into doing things which I consider unholy, and into doing things which I consider to be disobedient.
Please, God, keep me safe, and please provide for me.
I don't want to be here, God.
If You don't mind, please take me home now.
In Jesus Christ's name I ask,
AMEN!!
