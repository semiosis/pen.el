Although I was still attacked last night, I managed to beat it back.
It helped to pray last night and go over Psalm 91.
I still got some perverted dreams that I don't even want to mention.
I still had something attacking my loins in my sleep in the morning.
But I rebuked it and managed to get to this point.
And it's 7:39 in the morning and I'm listening to sanctuary radio and I prayed
for my family and friends.
So this morning has been a victory.

Yeah it does seem that there has been a demon or something which has been messing with my dreams.
It's disgusting.


Dear Heavenly Father, and my Lord Jesus Christ, and Holy Spirit,
Jehovah God,
please, Lord Jesus, forgive me.
I want to have pure thoughts.
I'm so sorry Lord Jesus.
Please clean me Lord Jesus.
Please do not allow demons to attack me.
Please do not allow the enemy to invade my mind.
Please do not allow these evil things to push evil dreams into my mind.
Please, God, help me to know what to do now.
In Jesus Christ's name I ask,
AMEN!!


Dear Heavenly Father, and my Lord Jesus Christ, and Holy Spirit,
please, LORD God, help my cat to not kill or catch any birds.
Also, please help her to eat her food properly.
And please help me to provide food for her.
In Jesus Christ's name I ask,
AMEN!!


Dear Heavenly Father, and my Lord Jesus Christ, and Holy Spirit,
God, I need help.
I simply do not understand why what has happened has happened.
It's not OK, Lord Jesus.
It's really not OK.
Help me Jesus please.
I don't feel well, Lord.
Please, Lord Jesus, make the spiritual attack end.
God, I am struggling.
God help me.
God, I do not want to be in this world.
That daredevil show is just blasphemous.
I'm so sorry, Lord Jesus Christ.
God I'm sorry.
Please, God, make me clean and pure.
Please, God, let me know what is sound doctrine.
Please help me God.
Please forgive me for saying anything incorrect.
Please, God, forgive me.
I have just been doing battle against the enemy and trying to be renewed in mind and corrected by Your Word.
Please, God, forgive me for making mistakes.
Please, God, clean me and rescue me from my own problems.
Please make me holy and pure.
Please do not let me perish.
I love You, Lord Jesus.
I do not want to be corrupt.
Please, God, deliver me from sin and from the devil.
In Jesus Christ's name I ask,
AMEN!!


Dear Heavenly Father, and my Lord Jesus Christ,
and Holy Spirit,
Jehovah God,
Your will be done, God.
Lord Jesus please heal me and protect me.
Please do not let me perish.
God Almighty, my body/soul feels incredibly harassed.
My relationships seem to be highly disrupted.
Please help me Lord Jesus.
In Jesus Christ's name I ask,
AMEN!!


Dear Heavenly Father, and my Lord Jesus Christ, and Holy Spirit,
Jehovah God,
what happened to me is not OK.
I want total deliverance in Jesus Christ's name.
What happened to me in court is just evil.
Please help me Lord Jesus.
I want to know that I'm totally right with You, Lord Jesus.
I want to know that I've been made totally holy, when it happens.
God forgive me.
Please don't destroy me.
I don't understand why this has happened to me.
Lord Jesus Christ,
I just want to hear from You.
Please deliver me from these harassing spirits of antichrist.
It's not fair, Lord Jesus.
It's just not fair.
I didn't understand what was going on.
I feel sick from what has happened.
God, I just want You to take me up.
I can't stay here, Lord Jesus.
In Jesus Christ's name I ask,
AMEN!!


Dear Heavenly Father, and my Lord Jesus Christ, and Holy Spirit,
LORD God, if You were to have granted me a Christian wife long ago then I wouldn't be in this situation.
I honestly think I would not be in this situation.
Lord Jesus Christ, I want to be rid of the spirit spouse stuff.
Lord Jesus Christ, honestly, it's not fair that I've been put into this situation.
Everything that happened to me was so profoundly unfair.
Lord Jesus Christ, I don't want to live in darkness, but I also want to know You're with me.
Lord Jesus Christ, I want to be delivered from this thing.
Lord Jesus Christ, please help me.
Heavenly Father, I do not know what has happened, but I love You, LORD.
I'm so sorry, LORD.
I have stuffed up so much.
I'm really sorry, LORD.
Heavenly Father, and my Lord Jesus Christ, and Holy Spirit,
Jehovah God,
please, LORD God, bring correction to the Pope.
Please, LORD God, save his soul.
Please, LORD God, bring correction to Your church.
Please, LORD God, bring correction to me.
Please, LORD God, continue using the Roman Catholic church.
Please, Heavenly Father, Lord Jesus Christ Son of God, and Holy Spirit,
deliver Your people from this damnable greed and fantasy propelling cryptocurrency and AI.
Father God, please feed Your people with Your word and with their daily bread.
Please, Father God, and Jesus Christ of Nazareth, Son of God, and Holy Spirit,
please help my brothers to trust in You.
Please also lead Zandiel to trust in You through trusting in Jesus.
Please help his mum to find a job, and to get steady money.
Please help me also to find a job so I can support people.
Or better yet, LORD, please just rapture me.
I really do not want to live here in this world anymore.
It feels so broken.
Thank You for Your mercy and grace towards me.
Please, LORD God, protect me from evil.
Please help me to trust in You.
In Jesus Christ's name I ask,
AMEN!!


Lord Jesus, I just want to have a good and unproblematic relationship with You through Jesus Christ my Lord.
That is what I want, LORD.


Please deliver me from this world, Lord Jesus.
Even the seek website is very anti-christian with it's "What do you seek?" advertising campaign.
It's disgusting and I do not even want to use it.
Please help me God.
I believe that You will support me.
