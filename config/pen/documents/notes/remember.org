** Saved not by my own works done outside of Him but by His work

Yes, I believe that Jesus Christ has paid the price in full for me to be saved, and that is surely what I am leaning on.
The price has been paid in full for me to be saved.

We are slaves to Christ and no other. We're not slaves to sin, we're not slaves to law, we're not slaves to men:

** In His flesh, Jesus has abolished the /enmity/ between Jews and Gentiles

*If* in Christ Jesus, we are one in Christ Jesus. It's the enmity that the Law had, not the law itself, which Jesus has abolished in His flesh for those who are in Christ:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *[[https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians%202%3A11-18&version=ESV][Ephesians 2:11-18]]* - Therefore remember that formerly you, the Gentiles in the flesh, who are called “Uncircumcision” by the so-called “Circumcision,” which is performed in the flesh by human hands-- remember that you were at that time separate from Christ, excluded from the commonwealth of Israel, and strangers to the covenants of promise, having no hope and without God in the world. But now in Christ Jesus you who formerly were far off have been brought near by the blood of Christ. For He Himself is our peace, who made both groups into one and broke down the barrier of the dividing wall, by abolishing in His flesh the enmity, which is the Law of commandments contained in ordinances, so that in Himself He might make the two into one new man, thus establishing peace, and might reconcile them both in one body to God through the cross, by it having put to death the enmity. And He came and preached peace to you who were far away, and peace to those who were near; for through Him we both have our access in one Spirit to the Father. (NASB)

Yeshua Hamashiach

King Yeshua - this lady says is Abba Father. Interesting.
I mean, its' still not wrong.

Yeshua is the Hebrew word for Salvation.

[[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jsBTIWjvYA][youtube.com: IT'S TIME TO WRAP THIS UP! & WHAT IS FAITH? : TWO WORDS FROM OUR ABBA FATHER {12th Sept}]]

It's because of our faith in our God that works follow.
It's all glory to Christ. Christ does the work in us.

Faith runs deep and is a heart matter.
People often confused belief in Jesus with faith in Jesus.

There's millions of false Jesus' out there.

How can a person have faith in someone when they don't know who they are.

We must get to know God for ourselves.
We must carry the words in our heart.
We carry the way in our heart.

Ultimately, we will carry the life in our heart, soul and spirit, and we will have true love in our heart for our God.

  *Luke 16:19-31* - There was a rich man who was clothed in purple and fine linen and who feasted sumptuously every day. And at his gate was laid a poor man named Lazarus, covered with sores, who desired to be fed with what fell from the rich man's table. Moreover, even the dogs came and licked his sores. The poor man died and was carried by the angels to Abraham's side. The rich man also died and was buried, and in Hades, being in torment, he lifted up his eyes and saw Abraham far off and Lazarus at his side. And he called out, Father Abraham, have mercy on me, and send Lazarus to dip the end of his finger in water and cool my tongue, for I am in anguish in this flame. But Abraham said, Child, remember that you in your lifetime received your good things, and Lazarus in like manner bad things; but now he is comforted here, and you are in anguish. And besides all this, between us and you a great chasm has been fixed, in order that those who would pass from here to you may not be able, and none may cross from there to us. And he said, Then I beg you, father, to send him to my father's house— for I have five brothers—so that he may warn them, lest they also come into this place of torment. But Abraham said, They have Moses and the Prophets; let them hear them. And he said, No, father Abraham, but if someone goes to them from the dead, they will repent. He said to him, If they do not hear Moses and the Prophets, neither will they be convinced if someone should rise from the dead. (ESV)

If your brother sins, rebuke him, and if he repents, forgive him, and if he sins against you seven times in the day, and turns to you seven times, saying, I repent, you must forgive him. The apostles said to the Lord, Increase our faith! And the Lord said, If you had faith like a grain of mustard seed, you could say to this mulberry tree, Be uprooted and planted in the sea, and it would obey you. Will any one of you who has a servant plowing or keeping sheep say to him when he has come in from the field, Come at once and recline at table? Will he not rather say to him, Prepare supper for me, and dress properly, and serve me while I eat and drink, and afterward you will eat and drink? Does he thank the servant because he did what was commanded? So you also, when you have done all that you were commanded, say, We are unworthy servants; we have only done what was our duty. (ESV)

If anyone hears my voice and opens the door, I will come in to him and eat with him, and he with me. The one who conquers, I will grant him to sit with me on my throne, as I also conquered and sat down with my Father on his throne. (ESV)

Let there be no filthiness nor foolish talk nor crude joking, which are out of place, but instead let there be thanksgiving. For you may be sure of this, that everyone who is sexually immoral or impure, or who is covetous (that is, an idolater), has no inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and God. Let no one deceive you with empty words, for because of these things the wrath of God comes upon the sons of disobedience. Therefore do not associate with them; for at one time you were darkness, but now you are light in the Lord. Walk as children of light (for the fruit of light is found in all that is good and right and true), and try to discern what is pleasing to the Lord. Take no part in the unfruitful works of darkness, but instead expose them. For it is shameful even to speak of the things that they do in secret. But when anything is exposed by the light, it becomes visible, for anything that becomes visible is light. Therefore it says, Awake, O sleeper, and arise from the dead, and Christ will shine on you.

For the whole law is fulfilled in one word: You shall love your neighbor as yourself. But if you bite and devour one another, watch out that you are not consumed by one another. But I say, walk by the Spirit, and you will not gratify the desires of the flesh. For the desires of the flesh are against the Spirit, and the desires of the Spirit are against the flesh, for these are opposed to each other, to keep you from doing the things you want to do. But if you are led by the Spirit, you are not under the law. Now the works of the flesh are evident: sexual immorality, impurity, sensuality, idolatry, sorcery, enmity, strife, jealousy, fits of anger, rivalries, dissensions, divisions, envy, drunkenness, orgies, and things like these. I warn you, as I warned you before, that those who do such things will not inherit the kingdom of God.

  *Jude 1:17-25* - But you must remember, beloved, the predictions of the apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ. They said to you, In the last time there will be scoffers, following their own ungodly passions. It is these who cause divisions, worldly people, devoid of the Spirit. But you, beloved, build yourselves up in your most holy faith; pray in the Holy Spirit; keep yourselves in the love of God, waiting for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ that leads to eternal life. And have mercy on those who doubt; save others by snatching them out of the fire; to others show mercy with fear, hating even the garment stained by the flesh. Now to him who is able to keep you from stumbling and to present you blameless before the presence of his glory with great joy, to the only God, our Savior, through Jesus Christ our Lord, be glory, majesty, dominion, and authority, before all time and now and forever. Amen. (ESV)

  *Matthew 6:25-34* - Therefore I tell you, do not be anxious about your life, what you will eat or what you will drink, nor about your body, what you will put on. Is not life more than food, and the body more than clothing? Look at the birds of the air: they neither sow nor reap nor gather into barns, and yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not of more value than they? And which of you by being anxious can add a single hour to his span of life? And why are you anxious about clothing? Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow: they neither toil nor spin, yet I tell you, even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these. But if God so clothes the grass of the field, which today is alive and tomorrow is thrown into the oven, will he not much more clothe you, O you of little faith? Therefore do not be anxious, saying, What shall we eat? or What shall we drink? or What shall we wear? For the Gentiles seek after all these things, and your heavenly Father knows that you need them all. But seek first the kingdom of God and his righteousness, and all these things will be added to you. Therefore do not be anxious about tomorrow, for tomorrow will be anxious for itself. Sufficient for the day is its own trouble. (ESV)

  *Titus 1:15* - To the pure, all things are pure, but to the defiled and unbelieving, nothing is pure; but both their minds and their consciences are defiled. (ESV)
#+END_QUOTE

Paul doesn't mean 'sin' is pure:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *Titus 1:10* - For there are many who are insubordinate, empty talkers and deceivers, especially those of the circumcision party. (ESV)
#+END_QUOTE

Paul was simply rebuking being of the flesh:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *Titus 1:13-14* - This testimony is true. Therefore rebuke them sharply, that they may be sound in the faith, not devoting themselves to Jewish myths and the commands of people who turn away from the truth. (ESV)
#+END_QUOTE

But in the same passage Paul encourages people to be holy:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *Titus 1:7-9* - For an overseer, as God's steward, must be above reproach. He must not be arrogant or quick-tempered or a drunkard or violent or greedy for gain, but hospitable, a lover of good, self-controlled, upright, holy, and disciplined. He must hold firm to the trustworthy word as taught, so that he may be able to give instruction in sound doctrine and also to rebuke those who contradict it. (ESV)

Repentance means turning away from sin, and all believers are supposed to turn away from sin which they themselves condemn:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *Romans 2:1-5* - Therefore you have no excuse, O man, every one of you who judges. For in passing judgment on another you condemn yourself, because you, the judge, practice the very same things. We know that the judgment of God rightly falls on those who do such things. Do you suppose, O man—you who judge those who do such things and yet do them yourself—that you will escape the judgment of God? Or do you presume on the riches of his kindness and forbearance and patience, not knowing that God's kindness is meant to lead you to repentance? But because of your hard and impenitent heart you are storing up wrath for yourself on the day of wrath when God's righteous judgment will be revealed. (ESV)

As it is, I rejoice, not because you were grieved, but because you were grieved into repenting. For you felt a godly grief, so that you suffered no loss through us. For godly grief produces a repentance that leads to salvation without regret, whereas worldly grief produces death. (ESV)

Then she said, Here is my servant Bilhah; go in to her, so that she may give birth on my behalf, that even I may have children through her. So she gave him her servant Bilhah as a wife, and Jacob went in to her. And Bilhah conceived and bore Jacob a son. Then Rachel said, God has judged me, and has also heard my voice and given me a son. Therefore she called his name Dan. Rachel's servant Bilhah conceived again and bore Jacob a second son. Then Rachel said, With mighty wrestlings I have wrestled with my sister and have prevailed. So she called his name Naphtali. (ESV)

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *Romans 4* - What then shall we say was gained by Abraham, our forefather according to the flesh? For if Abraham was justified by works, he has something to boast about, but not before God. For what does the Scripture say? Abraham believed God, and it was counted to him as righteousness. Now to the one who works, his wages are not counted as a gift but as his due. And to the one who does not work but trusts him who justifies the ungodly, his faith is counted as righteousness, just as David also speaks of the blessing of the one to whom God counts righteousness apart from works: Blessed are those whose lawless deeds are forgiven, and whose sins are covered; blessed is the man against whom the Lord will not count his sin. Is this blessing then only for the circumcised, or also for the uncircumcised? We say that faith was counted to Abraham as righteousness. How then was it counted to him? Was it before or after he had been circumcised? It was not after, but before he was circumcised. He received the sign of circumcision as a seal of the righteousness that he had by faith while he was still uncircumcised. The purpose was to make him the father of all who believe without being circumcised, so that righteousness would be counted to them as well, and to make him the father of the circumcised who are not merely circumcised but who also walk in the footsteps of the faith that our father Abraham had before he was circumcised. For the promise to Abraham and his offspring that he would be heir of the world did not come through the law but through the righteousness of faith. For if it is the adherents of the law who are to be the heirs, faith is null and the promise is void. For the law brings wrath, but where there is no law there is no transgression. That is why it depends on faith, in order that the promise may rest on grace and be guaranteed to all his offspring—not only to the adherent of the law but also to the one who shares the faith of Abraham, who is the father of us all, as it is written, I have made you the father of many nations—in the presence of the God in whom he believed, who gives life to the dead and calls into existence the things that do not exist. In hope he believed against hope, that he should become the father of many nations, as he had been told, So shall your offspring be. He did not weaken in faith when he considered his own body, which was as good as dead (since he was about a hundred years old), or when he considered the barrenness of Sarah's womb. No distrust made him waver concerning the promise of God, but he grew strong in his faith as he gave glory to God, fully convinced that God was able to do what he had promised. That is why his faith was counted to him as righteousness. But the words it was counted to him were not written for his sake alone, but for ours also. It will be counted to us who believe in him who raised from the dead Jesus our Lord, who was delivered up for our trespasses and raised for our justification. (ESV)

After three days they found him in the temple, sitting among the teachers, listening to them and asking them questions. And all who heard him were amazed at his understanding and his answers. And when his parents saw him, they were astonished. And his mother said to him, Son, why have you treated us so? Behold, your father and I have been searching for you in great distress. And he said to them, Why were you looking for me? Did you not know that I must be in my Father's house? And they did not understand the saying that he spoke to them.

And the father of the young woman shall say to the elders, I gave my daughter to this man to marry, and he hates her; and behold, he has accused her of misconduct, saying, I did not find in your daughter evidence of virginity. And yet this is the evidence of my daughter's virginity. And they shall spread the cloak before the elders of the city. Then the elders of that city shall take the man and whip him, and they shall fine him a hundred shekels of silver and give them to the father of the young woman, because he has brought a bad name upon a virgin of Israel. And she shall be his wife. He may not divorce her all his days. But if the thing is true, that evidence of virginity was not found in the young woman, then they shall bring out the young woman to the door of her father's house, and the men of her city shall stone her to death with stones, because she has done an outrageous thing in Israel by whoring in her father's house. So you shall purge the evil from your midst. If a man is found lying with the wife of another man, both of them shall die, the man who lay with the woman, and the woman. So you shall purge the evil from Israel. If there is a betrothed virgin, and a man meets her in the city and lies with her, then you shall bring them both out to the gate of that city, and you shall stone them to death with stones, the young woman because she did not cry for help though she was in the city, and the man because he violated his neighbor's wife. So you shall purge the evil from your midst. But if in the open country a man meets a young woman who is betrothed, and the man seizes her and lies with her, then only the man who lay with her shall die. But you shall do nothing to the young woman; she has committed no offense punishable by death. For this case is like that of a man attacking and murdering his neighbor, because he met her in the open country, and though the betrothed young woman cried for help there was no one to rescue her. If a man meets a virgin who is not betrothed, and seizes her and lies with her, and they are found, then the man who lay with her shall give to the father of the young woman fifty shekels of silver, and she shall be his wife, because he has violated her.

  *Romans 14:4-18* - Who are you to pass judgment on the servant of another? It is before his own master that he stands or falls. And he will be upheld, for the Lord is able to make him stand. One person esteems one day as better than another, while another esteems all days alike. Each one should be fully convinced in his own mind. The one who observes the day, observes it in honor of the Lord. The one who eats, eats in honor of the Lord, since he gives thanks to God, while the one who abstains, abstains in honor of the Lord and gives thanks to God. For none of us lives to himself, and none of us dies to himself. If we live, we live to the Lord, and if we die, we die to the Lord. So then, whether we live or whether we die, we are the Lord's. For to this end Christ died and lived again, that he might be Lord both of the dead and of the living. Why do you pass judgment on your brother? Or you, why do you despise your brother? For we will all stand before the judgment seat of God; for it is written, As I live, says the Lord, every knee shall bow to me, and every tongue shall confess to God. So then each of us will give an account of himself to God. Therefore let us not pass judgment on one another any longer, but rather decide never to put a stumbling block or hindrance in the way of a brother. I know and am persuaded in the Lord Jesus that nothing is unclean in itself, but it is unclean for anyone who thinks it unclean. For if your brother is grieved by what you eat, you are no longer walking in love. By what you eat, do not destroy the one for whom Christ died. So do not let what you regard as good be spoken of as evil. For the kingdom of God is not a matter of eating and drinking but of righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Spirit. Whoever thus serves Christ is acceptable to God and approved by men. (ESV)

  *John 10:1-21* - Truly, truly, I say to you, he who does not enter the sheepfold by the door but climbs in by another way, that man is a thief and a robber. But he who enters by the door is the shepherd of the sheep. To him the gatekeeper opens. The sheep hear his voice, and he calls his own sheep by name and leads them out. When he has brought out all his own, he goes before them, and the sheep follow him, for they know his voice. A stranger they will not follow, but they will flee from him, for they do not know the voice of strangers. This figure of speech Jesus used with them, but they did not understand what he was saying to them. So Jesus again said to them, Truly, truly, I say to you, I am the door of the sheep. All who came before me are thieves and robbers, but the sheep did not listen to them. I am the door. If anyone enters by me, he will be saved and will go in and out and find pasture. The thief comes only to steal and kill and destroy. I came that they may have life and have it abundantly. I am the good shepherd. The good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep. He who is a hired hand and not a shepherd, who does not own the sheep, sees the wolf coming and leaves the sheep and flees, and the wolf snatches them and scatters them. He flees because he is a hired hand and cares nothing for the sheep. I am the good shepherd. I know my own and my own know me, just as the Father knows me and I know the Father; and I lay down my life for the sheep. And I have other sheep that are not of this fold. I must bring them also, and they will listen to my voice. So there will be one flock, one shepherd. For this reason the Father loves me, because I lay down my life that I may take it up again. No one takes it from me, but I lay it down of my own accord. I have authority to lay it down, and I have authority to take it up again. This charge I have received from my Father. There was again a division among the Jews because of these words. Many of them said, He has a demon, and is insane; why listen to him? Others said, These are not the words of one who is oppressed by a demon. Can a demon open the eyes of the blind? (ESV)

  *Romans 8* - There is therefore now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus. For the law of the Spirit of life has set you free in Christ Jesus from the law of sin and death. For God has done what the law, weakened by the flesh, could not do. By sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh and for sin, he condemned sin in the flesh, in order that the righteous requirement of the law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not according to the flesh but according to the Spirit. For those who live according to the flesh set their minds on the things of the flesh, but those who live according to the Spirit set their minds on the things of the Spirit. To set the mind on the flesh is death, but to set the mind on the Spirit is life and peace. For the mind that is set on the flesh is hostile to God, for it does not submit to God's law; indeed, it cannot. Those who are in the flesh cannot please God. You, however, are not in the flesh but in the Spirit, if in fact the Spirit of God dwells in you. Anyone who does not have the Spirit of Christ does not belong to him. But if Christ is in you, although the body is dead because of sin, the Spirit is life because of righteousness. If the Spirit of him who raised Jesus from the dead dwells in you, he who raised Christ Jesus from the dead will also give life to your mortal bodies through his Spirit who dwells in you. So then, brothers, we are debtors, not to the flesh, to live according to the flesh. For if you live according to the flesh you will die, but if by the Spirit you put to death the deeds of the body, you will live. For all who are led by the Spirit of God are sons of God. For you did not receive the spirit of slavery to fall back into fear, but you have received the Spirit of adoption as sons, by whom we cry, Abba! Father! The Spirit himself bears witness with our spirit that we are children of God, and if children, then heirs—heirs of God and fellow heirs with Christ, provided we suffer with him in order that we may also be glorified with him. For I consider that the sufferings of this present time are not worth comparing with the glory that is to be revealed to us. For the creation waits with eager longing for the revealing of the sons of God. For the creation was subjected to futility, not willingly, but because of him who subjected it, in hope that the creation itself will be set free from its bondage to decay and obtain the freedom of the glory of the children of God. For we know that the whole creation has been groaning together in the pains of childbirth until now. And not only the creation, but we ourselves, who have the firstfruits of the Spirit, groan inwardly as we wait eagerly for adoption as sons, the redemption of our bodies. For in this hope we were saved. Now hope that is seen is not hope. For who hopes for what he sees? But if we hope for what we do not see, we wait for it with patience. Likewise the Spirit helps us in our weakness. For we do not know what to pray for as we ought, but the Spirit himself intercedes for us with groanings too deep for words. And he who searches hearts knows what is the mind of the Spirit, because the Spirit intercedes for the saints according to the will of God. And we know that for those who love God all things work together for good, for those who are called according to his purpose. For those whom he foreknew he also predestined to be conformed to the image of his Son, in order that he might be the firstborn among many brothers. And those whom he predestined he also called, and those whom he called he also justified, and those whom he justified he also glorified. What then shall we say to these things? If God is for us, who can be against us? He who did not spare his own Son but gave him up for us all, how will he not also with him graciously give us all things? Who shall bring any charge against God's elect? It is God who justifies. Who is to condemn? Christ Jesus is the one who died—more than that, who was raised—who is at the right hand of God, who indeed is interceding for us. Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? Shall tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or danger, or sword? As it is written, For your sake we are being killed all the day long; we are regarded as sheep to be slaughtered. No, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him who loved us. For I am sure that neither death nor life, nor angels nor rulers, nor things present nor things to come, nor powers, nor height nor depth, nor anything else in all creation, will be able to separate us from the love of God in Christ Jesus our Lord.

This is the spirit of the antichrist, which you heard was coming and now is in the world already. Little children, you are from God and have overcome them, for he who is in you is greater than he who is in the world. They are from the world; therefore they speak from the world, and the world listens to them. We are from God. Whoever knows God listens to us; whoever is not from God does not listen to us. By this we know the Spirit of truth and the spirit of error. (ESV)

+ [[https://youtube.com/watch?v=w-bUfmj21DM&t=1309][youtube.com: Sanctify Christ as Lord @time: 21 min 49 sec]] ::  When I stress that the glory of Christianity is that God wants His name to be hallowed through your hoping in what He does for you rather than for what you do for Him, that does not lead to passivity. It never has in the history of the Christian church. The people that believe that most dearly and most intently have the Holy Spirit working not instead of them but inside of them, stirring them up to maximise their enjoyment of the grace of God shed abroad in their labours.  God took the sting out of death and He took the futility out of labour, so that He says, "You will mount up like wings like eagles. You will run and not grow weary. You will walk and not faint." His power doesn't take the joy of meaningful labour and productivity away from up. It gets under it. It gets behind it. It gets in it. It gets in front of it with reward.  It empowers it so that it's satisfying and freeing and liberating and you come to the end of your day wonderfully weary, not excruciatingly weary. The main point of the message is that God's name and His Son's name should be hallowed in our hearts and it should be hallowed best when we hope most in Him.

* Deliverance
Conditions:
1. Be humble
2. Be honest
3. Confess faith in Christ
4. Confess any known sin
5. Repent of all sin
6. Break with all occult, curses and secret societies
7. Forgive others
8. Expel - breathe out

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *Proverbs 28:13* - Whoever conceals his transgressions will not prosper, but he who confesses and forsakes them will obtain mercy. (ESV)
#+END_QUOTE

** Why some people are not delivered
For not meeting the conditions.
It's not so much a test of your spiritual power. It's a test of
whether or not you've met the conditions.
When performing deliverance on others, don't focus on yourself.
Focus on those people meeting the conditions.
You may feel yourself a little midget, but you're representing a victorious Christ.

1. Lack of repentance - There is no guarantee to anybody who is not willing to repent.
2. Lack of desperation - Deliverance is for the desperate. Summed up in one word 'passivity.' And many times you've got to do something to prod the person who wants to be delivered. Christ has given us authority over human spirits but not over the human will. You cannot will for the other person. The person has to will for them self. I'm desperate.
3. Wrong motives. We are not delivered in order to get off the hook. We're delivered to serve the LORD. *James 4:3* - You ask and do not receive, because you ask wrongly, to spend it on your passions. (ESV) [[https://youtube.com/watch?v=_BObeTNJsG4&t=1634][youtube.com: How To Expel The Enemy | Basics Of Deliverance Pt. 2 | Derek Prince @time: 27 min 14 sec]] People who come to get off the hook do not qualify for deliverance.
4. Self-centeredness. Desire for attention. Some people don't get delivered because they wouldn't be the center of attention anymore. Some of the chronic cases of deliverance never want to get delivered because they're poor, neglected, rejected people. This is the only time they get the center of the stage. One thing you're notice about all people who are focused by demons is that in some way or other they are self-centered. In fact, self-centeredness is an invitation to demon attention. Sometimes you just have to let the person go and say, "Listen, you've had enough. You can do it for yourself and if you don't do it for yourself, nobody else is going to do it for you."
  - We can do this for ourself.
5. Failure to break with the occult. That includes getting rid of occult objects. Anything that savours a supersition is demonic. Moses said if you bring an accursed thing into your house you become accursed like it. Most Christians need to go through their homes and clean out a lot of rubbish. I make it a principle, I don't want to keep in my house anything that dishonours Jesus Christ or honours satan.
  - *Deuteronomy 7:26* - And you shall not bring an abominable thing into your house and become devoted to destruction like it. You shall utterly detest and abhor it, for it is devoted to destruction. (ESV)
6. Failure to sever evil soulish relationships. Sometimes you have to break some relationships; if they're evil, if they're binding, if they're gooey - a kind of sloppy sentimentality that isn't honest.
  - I rebuke in Jesus Christ's name that anti-relationship spirit which has been attacking my relationships which were everything to do with love and honesty and truth, and nothing to do with dishonest sloppy sentimentality.
7. Under a curse. Will not be delivered or healed until the curse is broken.
   - Any curses against me shall be broken in Jesus Christ's name.
8. Failure to confess a specific sin. Abortion has to be confessed as murder.
9. Not "separated" by water baptism
   - People who are not water baptised (in Derek Princes' opinion) do not qualify to stay free.
10. Part of a larger battle requiring corporate action. Some people are satan's battlefield (this is definitely me), and satan will not let them go because of what they are themselves but because of what they stand for. There are people for who the whole body has to take responsibility. I need prayer to break these chains.

** How to keep your deliverance
1. Make Jesus Lord in every area of my life. An unclean spirit in a dream last night <2024-07-02 Tue> said Jesus wasn't my Lord. I rebuke it in Jesus Christ's name.
2. Garment of Praise. *Isaiah 61:3* - To grant those who mourn in Zion, Giving them a garland instead of ashes, The oil of gladness instead of mourning, The mantle of praise instead of a spirit of fainting. So they will be called oaks of righteousness, The planting of the LORD, that He may be glorified. (NASB)

Fighting sin is both a gift from God and a duty we act.

Increasing holiness is both a gift and a duty.

It is a gift of grace that we receive from Jesus and the way that we receive a gift that involves your thoughts, desires and behaviour
is by having the thoughts, the desires and actions.
It is a gift you live out, work out.
It's a '_working out_' of the salvation that is free-grace.

  - *Ephesians 6:18* - praying at all times in the Spirit, with all prayer and supplication. To that end keep alert with all perseverance, making supplication for all the saints, (ESV)
- Have words to continue praying when our words run out (Romans 8:25) Pray confidently knowing we intercede for others according to the will of God (Romans 8:26-27)
  - *Romans 8:25* - But if we hope for what we do not see, we wait for it with patience. (ESV)
  - *Romans 8:26-27* - Likewise the Spirit helps us in our weakness. For we do not know what to pray for as we ought, but the Spirit himself intercedes for us with groanings too deep for words. And he who searches hearts knows what is the mind of the Spirit, because the Spirit intercedes for the saints according to the will of God. (ESV)

Do not feel at ease if you can look at the world and say, "They go to hell but I go with Christ to heaven."

90% of Christians today are in this state.
They focus on the sinfulness of the world and they are almost happy that this is the state of the world.
We should burn with pain for the sin of the world.
And we should perceive our own sin, present and past.

We want to be co-strugglers with Chist.

  *Romans 10:1-21* - Brothers, my heart's desire and prayer to God for them is that they may be saved. I bear them witness that they have a zeal for God, but not according to knowledge. For, being ignorant of the righteousness that comes from God, and seeking to establish their own, they did not submit to God's righteousness. For Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to everyone who believes. For Moses writes about the righteousness that is based on the law, that the person who does the commandments shall live by them. But the righteousness based on faith says, Do not say in your heart, Who will ascend into heaven? (that is, to bring Christ down) or Who will descend into the abyss? (that is, to bring Christ up from the dead). But what does it say? The word is near you, in your mouth and in your heart (that is, the word of faith that we proclaim); because, if you confess with your mouth that Jesus is Lord and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved. For with the heart one believes and is justified, and with the mouth one confesses and is saved. For the Scripture says, Everyone who believes in him will not be put to shame. For there is no distinction between Jew and Greek; the same Lord is Lord of all, bestowing his riches on all who call on him. For everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved. But how are they to call on him in whom they have not believed? And how are they to believe in him of whom they have never heard? And how are they to hear without someone preaching? And how are they to preach unless they are sent? As it is written, How beautiful are the feet of those who preach the good news! But they have not all obeyed the gospel. For Isaiah says, Lord, who has believed what he has heard from us? So faith comes from hearing, and hearing through the word of Christ. But I ask, have they not heard? Indeed they have, for Their voice has gone out to all the earth, and their words to the ends of the world. But I ask, did Israel not understand? First Moses says, I will make you jealous of those who are not a nation; with a foolish nation I will make you angry. Then Isaiah is so bold as to say, I have been found by those who did not seek me; I have shown myself to those who did not ask for me. But of Israel he says, All day long I have held out my hands to a disobedient and contrary people. (ESV)

* 5 Principles of deliverance
- A believer has demons or they don't
  - One person is taking notes, writing every name of every demon that spoke out
  - Another one is praying in the Holy Spirit
- If they have a demon, it must be there because it has legal consent to be there
  - It could be something that happened 'to' you
- The believer who is being delivered must have sincere desire to be delivered from demonic powers
  - The human will is recognised in this process. You have to want to be free. You have to:
    - Confess
    - Denounce
    - Renounce
    - Repent
  - During deliverance, wake the believer/person up by calling them by name
    - [[https://youtube.com/watch?v=TagBJKpr2OI&t=2972][youtube.com: HOW to cast out a demon @time: 49 min 32 sec]]
  - The believer who is being delivered has to want to be free more than the person performing the deliverance
  - Must remove the legal right/s
  - Once the legal right/s are removed the demon can then be cast out

  *Exodus 14:14-32* - The LORD will fight for you, and you have only to be silent. The LORD said to Moses, Why do you cry to me? Tell the people of Israel to go forward. Lift up your staff, and stretch out your hand over the sea and divide it, that the people of Israel may go through the sea on dry ground. And I will harden the hearts of the Egyptians so that they shall go in after them, and I will get glory over Pharaoh and all his host, his chariots, and his horsemen. And the Egyptians shall know that I am the LORD, when I have gotten glory over Pharaoh, his chariots, and his horsemen. Then the angel of God who was going before the host of Israel moved and went behind them, and the pillar of cloud moved from before them and stood behind them, coming between the host of Egypt and the host of Israel. And there was the cloud and the darkness. And it lit up the night without one coming near the other all night. Then Moses stretched out his hand over the sea, and the LORD drove the sea back by a strong east wind all night and made the sea dry land, and the waters were divided. And the people of Israel went into the midst of the sea on dry ground, the waters being a wall to them on their right hand and on their left. The Egyptians pursued and went in after them into the midst of the sea, all Pharaoh's horses, his chariots, and his horsemen. And in the morning watch the LORD in the pillar of fire and of cloud looked down on the Egyptian forces and threw the Egyptian forces into a panic, clogging their chariot wheels so that they drove heavily. And the Egyptians said, Let us flee from before Israel, for the LORD fights for them against the Egyptians. Then the LORD said to Moses, Stretch out your hand over the sea, that the water may come back upon the Egyptians, upon their chariots, and upon their horsemen. So Moses stretched out his hand over the sea, and the sea returned to its normal course when the morning appeared. And as the Egyptians fled into it, the LORD threw the Egyptians into the midst of the sea. The waters returned and covered the chariots and the horsemen; of all the host of Pharaoh that had followed them into the sea, not one of them remained. But the people of Israel walked on dry ground through the sea, the waters being a wall to them on their right hand and on their left. Thus the LORD saved Israel that day from the hand of the Egyptians, and Israel saw the Egyptians dead on the seashore. Israel saw the great power that the LORD used against the Egyptians, so the people feared the LORD, and they believed in the LORD and in his servant Moses. Then Moses and the people of Israel sang this song to the LORD, saying, I will sing to the LORD, for he has triumphed gloriously; the horse and his rider he has thrown into the sea. (ESV)

  Chapter 7.

  Concerning Baptism.

  And concerning baptism, baptize this way:
  Having first said all these things, baptize
  into the name of the Father, and of the Son,
  and of the Holy Spirit, in living water.

  But if you have no living water, baptize into
  other water; and if you cannot do so in cold
  water, do so in warm.

  But if you have neither, pour out water three
  times upon the head into the name of Father
  and Son and Holy Spirit.

  But before the baptism let the baptizer fast,
  and the baptized, and whoever else can; but
  you shall order the baptized to fast one or
  two days before.

We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed, in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trumpet. For the trumpet will sound, and the dead will be raised imperishable, and we shall be changed. For this perishable body must put on the imperishable, and this mortal body must put on immortality. When the perishable puts on the imperishable, and the mortal puts on immortality, then shall come to pass the saying that is written: Death is swallowed up in victory. O death, where is your victory? O death, where is your sting? The sting of death is sin, and the power of sin is the law. But thanks be to God, who gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ. (ESV)

Whoever feeds on my flesh and drinks my blood has eternal life, and I will raise him up on the last day. For my flesh is true food, and my blood is true drink.

Therefore we ourselves boast about you in the churches of God for your steadfastness and faith in all your persecutions and in the afflictions that you are enduring. This is evidence of the righteous judgment of God, that you may be considered worthy of the kingdom of God, for which you are also suffering— since indeed God considers it just to repay with affliction those who afflict you, and to grant relief to you who are afflicted as well as to us, when the Lord Jesus is revealed from heaven with his mighty angels in flaming fire, inflicting vengeance on those who do not know God and on those who do not obey the gospel of our Lord Jesus. They will suffer the punishment of eternal destruction, away from the presence of the Lord and from the glory of his might, when he comes on that day to be glorified in his saints, and to be marveled at among all who have believed, because our testimony to you was believed. To this end we always pray for you, that our God may make you worthy of his calling and may fulfill every resolve for good and every work of faith by his power, so that the name of our Lord Jesus may be glorified in you, and you in him, according to the grace of our God and the Lord Jesus Christ.

  *II Thessalonians 1:5-8* - This is evidence of the righteous judgment of God, that you may be considered worthy of the kingdom of God, for which you are also suffering— since indeed God considers it just to repay with affliction those who afflict you, and to grant relief to you who are afflicted as well as to us, when the Lord Jesus is revealed from heaven with his mighty angels in flaming fire, inflicting vengeance on those who do not know God and on those who do not obey the gospel of our Lord Jesus.

To this end we always pray for you, that our God may make you worthy of his calling and may fulfill every resolve for good and every work of faith by his power, so that the name of our Lord Jesus may be glorified in you, and you in him, according to the grace of our God and the Lord Jesus Christ.

  *Ezekiel 37:12-19* - Therefore prophesy, and say to them, Thus says the Lord GOD: Behold, I will open your graves and raise you from your graves, O my people. And I will bring you into the land of Israel. And you shall know that I am the LORD, when I open your graves, and raise you from your graves, O my people. And I will put my Spirit within you, and you shall live, and I will place you in your own land. Then you shall know that I am the LORD; I have spoken, and I will do it, declares the LORD. The word of the LORD came to me: Son of man, take a stick and write on it, For Judah, and the people of Israel associated with him; then take another stick and write on it, For Joseph (the stick of Ephraim) and all the house of Israel associated with him. And join them one to another into one stick, that they may become one in your hand. And when your people say to you, Will you not tell us what you mean by these? say to them, Thus says the Lord GOD: Behold, I am about to take the stick of Joseph (that is in the hand of Ephraim) and the tribes of Israel associated with him. And I will join with it the stick of Judah, and make them one stick, that they may be one in my hand. (ESV)

** If your eye is healthy, your whole body will be full of light
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *Matthew 6:22-29* - The eye is the lamp of the body. So, if your eye is healthy, your whole body will be full of light, but if your eye is bad, your whole body will be full of darkness. If then the light in you is darkness, how great is the darkness! No one can serve two masters, for either he will hate the one and love the other, or he will be devoted to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve God and money. Therefore I tell you, do not be anxious about your life, what you will eat or what you will drink, nor about your body, what you will put on. Is not life more than food, and the body more than clothing? Look at the birds of the air: they neither sow nor reap nor gather into barns, and yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not of more value than they? And which of you by being anxious can add a single hour to his span of life? And why are you anxious about clothing? Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow: they neither toil nor spin, yet I tell you, even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these. (ESV)

  *Acts 16:16-34* - As we were going to the place of prayer, we were met by a slave girl who had a spirit of divination and brought her owners much gain by fortune-telling. She followed Paul and us, crying out, These men are servants of the Most High God, who proclaim to you the way of salvation. And this she kept doing for many days. Paul, having become greatly annoyed, turned and said to the spirit, I command you in the name of Jesus Christ to come out of her. And it came out *that very hour.* But when her owners saw that their hope of gain was gone, they seized Paul and Silas and dragged them into the marketplace before the rulers. And when they had brought them to the magistrates, they said, These men are Jews, and they are disturbing our city. They advocate customs that are not lawful for us as Romans to accept or practice. The crowd joined in attacking them, and the magistrates tore the garments off them and gave orders to beat them with rods. And when they had inflicted many blows upon them, they threw them into prison, ordering the jailer to keep them safely. Having received this order, he put them into the inner prison and fastened their feet in the stocks. About midnight Paul and Silas were praying and singing hymns to God, and the prisoners were listening to them, and suddenly there was a great earthquake, so that the foundations of the prison were shaken. And immediately all the doors were opened, and everyone's bonds were unfastened. When the jailer woke and saw that the prison doors were open, he drew his sword and was about to kill himself, supposing that the prisoners had escaped. But Paul cried with a loud voice, Do not harm yourself, for we are all here. And the jailer called for lights and rushed in, and trembling with fear he fell down before Paul and Silas. Then he brought them out and said, Sirs, what must I do to be saved? And they said, Believe in the Lord Jesus, and you will be saved, you and your household. And they spoke the word of the Lord to him and to all who were in his house. And he took them the same hour of the night and washed their wounds; and he was baptized at once, he and all his family. Then he brought them up into his house and set food before them. And he rejoiced along with his entire household that he had believed in God. (ESV)

  Je 23:23: Am I a God at hand, declares the Lord, and not a God afar off?
  Je 23:24: Can a man hide himself in secret places so that I cannot see him? declares the Lord. Do I not fill heaven and earth? declares the Lord.
  Je 23:25: I have heard what the prophets have said who prophesy lies in my name, saying, I have dreamed, I have dreamed!
  Je 23:26: How long shall there be lies in the heart of the prophets who prophesy lies, and who prophesy the deceit of their own heart,
  Je 23:27: who think to make my people forget my name by their dreams that they tell one another, even as their fathers forgot my name for Baal?
  Je 23:28: Let the prophet who has a dream tell the dream, but let him who has my word speak my word faithfully. What has straw in common with wheat? declares the Lord.
  Je 23:29: Is not my word like fire, declares the Lord, and like a hammer that breaks the rock in pieces?
  Je 23:30: Therefore, behold, I am against the prophets, declares the Lord, who steal my words from one another.

  Je 23:32: Behold, I am against those who prophesy lying dreams, declares the Lord, and who tell them and lead my people astray by their lies and their recklessness, when I did not send them or charge them. So they do not profit this people at all, declares the Lord.
  Je 23:33: When one of this people, or a prophet or a priest asks you, What is the burden of the Lord? you shall say to them, You are the burden, and I will cast you off, declares the Lord.
  Je 23:34: And as for the prophet, priest, or one of the people who says, The burden of the Lord, I will punish that man and his household.
  Je 23:35: Thus shall you say, every one to his neighbor and every one to his brother, What has the Lord answered? or What has the Lord spoken?
  Je 23:36: But the burden of the Lord you shall mention no more, for the burden is every man's own word, and you pervert the words of the living God, the Lord of hosts, our God.
  Je 23:37: Thus you shall say to the prophet, What has the Lord answered you? or What has the Lord spoken?
  Je 23:38: But if you say, The burden of the Lord, thus says the Lord, Because you have said these words, The burden of the Lord, when I sent to you, saying, You shall not say, The burden of the Lord,
  Je 23:39: therefore, behold, I will surely lift you up and cast you away from my presence, you and the city that I gave to you and your fathers.

Then you will understand righteousness and justice and equity, every good path; for wisdom will come into your heart, and knowledge will be pleasant to your soul; discretion will watch over you, understanding will guard you, delivering you from the way of evil, from men of perverted speech, who forsake the paths of uprightness to walk in the ways of darkness, who rejoice in doing evil and delight in the perverseness of evil, men whose paths are crooked, and who are devious in their ways.

Nevertheless, the “endless genealogies” that
Paul mentions in 1 Timothy 1:4 (cf. Titus 3:9)
might refer to a concept similar to
that of the complex series of emanations, or
aeons, that is a feature in some Gnostic
teachings.

[See footnotes for another explanation of the
“endless genealogies.”] These aeons were seen
as a series of links between the supreme God
(an unknowable, pure spirit) and humanity.

Rather than numerous aeons, however, Paul
states in 1 Timothy 2:5: “There is one God and
one mediator between God and humanity—the
human being Jesus Christ.”

I rebuke reincarnation in Jesus Christ's name.
I rebuke anything that muffles the gospel of Jesus Christ.

I declare that Jesus Christ is the *only one* who can save us.
Jesus Christ is the only one who can judge the living and the dead.
Jesus Christ is the only one that everyone will declare is Lord to the glory of God the Father.

Jesus won, and He included me in on it.  1 CORINTHIANS 1:30 - But by His doing you are in Christ Jesus, who became to us wisdom from God, and righteousness and sanctification, and redemption, (NASB)   I'm going to serve Jesus for the rest of my life. I pray that people put their faith in Jesus and receive the free gift of salvation from Him.  ROMANS 10:9-10 - because, if you confess with your mouth that Jesus is Lord and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved. For with the heart one believes and is justified, and with the mouth one confesses and is saved. (ESV)  I know I've been born-again but I've still been wrestling with sin and against evil spirits. But I'm not listening to the beguiling lies of the enemy through dreams, visions, etc. but I'm just going to keep focused on Jesus.  PHILIPPIANS 1:6 - And I am sure of this, that he who began a good work in you will bring it to completion at the day of Jesus Christ. (ESV)  My enemies are not human beings.  EPHESIANS 6:12 - For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places.

  1P 1:1: Peter, an apostle of Jesus Christ, To those who are elect exiles of the dispersion in Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia,
  1P 1:2: according to the foreknowledge of God the Father, in the sanctification of the Spirit, for obedience to Jesus Christ and for sprinkling with his blood: May grace and peace be multiplied to you.
  1P 1:3: Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ! According to his great mercy, he has caused us to be born again to a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead,
  1P 1:4: to an inheritance that is imperishable, undefiled, and unfading, kept in heaven for you,
  1P 1:5: who by God's power are being guarded through faith for a salvation ready to be revealed in the last time.
  1P 1:6: In this you rejoice, though now for a little while, if necessary, you have been grieved by various trials,
  1P 1:7: so that the tested genuineness of your faith—more precious than gold that perishes though it is tested by fire—may be found to result in praise and glory and honor at the revelation of Jesus Christ.
  1P 1:8: Though you have not seen him, you love him. Though you do not now see him, you believe in him and rejoice with joy that is inexpressible and filled with glory,
  1P 1:9: obtaining the outcome of your faith, the salvation of your souls.
  1P 1:10: Concerning this salvation, the prophets who prophesied about the grace that was to be yours searched and inquired carefully,
  1P 1:11: inquiring what person or time the Spirit of Christ in them was indicating when he predicted the sufferings of Christ and the subsequent glories.
  1P 1:12: It was revealed to them that they were serving not themselves but you, in the things that have now been announced to you through those who preached the good news to you by the Holy Spirit sent from heaven, things into which angels long to look.
  1P 1:13: Therefore, preparing your minds for action, and being sober-minded, set your hope fully on the grace that will be brought to you at the revelation of Jesus Christ.
  1P 1:14: As obedient children, do not be conformed to the passions of your former ignorance,
  1P 1:15: but as he who called you is holy, you also be holy in all your conduct,
  1P 1:16: since it is written, You shall be holy, for I am holy.
  1P 1:17: And if you call on him as Father who judges impartially according to each one's deeds, conduct yourselves with fear throughout the time of your exile,
  1P 1:18: knowing that you were ransomed from the futile ways inherited from your forefathers, not with perishable things such as silver or gold,
  1P 1:19: but with the precious blood of Christ, like that of a lamb without blemish or spot.
  1P 1:20: He was foreknown before the foundation of the world but was made manifest in the last times for your sake,
  1P 1:21: who through him are believers in God, who raised him from the dead and gave him glory, so that your faith and hope are in God.
  1P 1:22: Having purified your souls by your obedience to the truth for a sincere brotherly love, love one another earnestly from a pure heart,
  1P 1:23: since you have been born again, not of perishable seed but of imperishable, through the living and abiding word of God;
  1P 1:24: for All flesh is like grass and all its glory like the flower of grass. The grass withers, and the flower falls,
  1P 1:25: but the word of the Lord remains forever. And this word is the good news that was preached to you.

What then?

Are we Jews any better off?

No, not at all.

For we have already charged that all, both
Jews and Greeks, are under sin, as it is
written: None is righteous, no, not one; no
one understands; no one seeks for God.

All have turned aside; together they have
become worthless; no one does good, not even
one.

Their throat is an open grave; they use their
tongues to deceive.

The venom of asps is under their lips.

Their mouth is full of curses and bitterness.

Their feet are swift to shed blood; in their
paths are ruin and misery, and the way of
peace they have not known.

There is no fear of God before their eyes.

Now we know that whatever the law says it
speaks to those who are under the law, so that
every mouth may be stopped, and the whole
world may be held accountable to God.

For by works of the law no human being will be
justified in his sight, since through the law
comes knowledge of sin.

But the free gift is not like the trespass.

For if many died through one man's trespass,
much more have the grace of God and the free
gift by the grace of that one man Jesus Christ
abounded for many.

And the free gift is not like the result of
that one man's sin.

For the judgment following one trespass
brought condemnation, but the free gift
following many trespasses brought
justification.

If, because of one man's trespass, death
reigned through that one man, much more will
those who receive the abundance of grace and
the free gift of righteousness reign in life
through the one man Jesus Christ.

Therefore, as one trespass led to condemnation
for all men, so one act of righteousness leads
to justification and life for all men.

For as by the one man's disobedience the many
were made sinners, so by the one man's
obedience the many will be made righteous.

  The staff member said something like, "there, go to Jesus (in a way that was a little bit off)" but she was directing her to me.
  I said, "In Jesus Christ's name I rebuke that sickness."
  The girl came up to me and I held her and as that happened the staff member asked me, "So does anything happen to you?".

*Romans 6:1-14* - What shall we say then? Are we to continue in sin so that grace may increase? May it never be! How shall we who died to sin still live in it? Or do you not know that all of us who have been baptized into Christ Jesus have been baptized into His death? Therefore we have been buried with Him through baptism into death, so that as Christ was raised from the dead through the glory of the Father, so we too might walk in newness of life. For if we have become united with Him in the likeness of His death, certainly we shall also be in the likeness of His resurrection, knowing this, that our old self was crucified with Him, in order that our body of sin might be done away with, so that we would no longer be slaves to sin; for he who has died is freed from sin. Now if we have died with Christ, we believe that we shall also live with Him, knowing that Christ, having been raised from the dead, is never to die again; death no longer is master over Him. For the death that He died, He died to sin once for all; but the life that He lives, He lives to God. Even so consider yourselves to be dead to sin, but alive to God in Christ Jesus. Therefore do not let sin reign in your mortal body so that you obey its lusts, and do not go on presenting the members of your body to sin as instruments of unrighteousness; but present yourselves to God as those alive from the dead, and your members as instruments of righteousness to God. For sin shall not be master over you, for you are not under law but under grace.

The Bible is just as clear that salvation is conditional; God does not save everyone. The one
condition for salvation is faith in Jesus Christ. Over one hundred times in the New Testament, faith

One day, some people asked Jesus what they could do to please God: “What must we do to do the works
God requires?” Jesus immediately points them to faith: “The work of God is this: to believe in the one
he has sent”.

But if it is by grace, it is no longer on the
basis of works; otherwise grace would no

(ESV)
#+end_src

Grace is God giving us something we cannot earn or deserve. According to Romans 11:6, “works” of any
kind destroys grace—the idea is that a worker earns payment, while the recipient of grace simply
receives it, unearned.

Since salvation is all of grace, it cannot be earned. Faith, therefore, is a
non-work. Faith cannot truly be considered a “work,” or else it would destroy grace. (See also Romans
4—Abraham’s salvation was dependent on faith in God, as opposed to any work he performed.)

Suppose someone anonymously sent you a check for $1,000,000. The money is yours if you want it, but
you still must endorse the check. In no way can signing your name be considered earning the million
dollars—the endorsement is a non-work. You can never boast about becoming a millionaire through sheer
effort or your own business savvy. No, the million dollars was simply a gift, and signing your name
was the only way to receive it. Similarly, exercising faith is the only way to receive the generous
gift of God, and faith cannot be considered a work worthy of the gift.

True faith cannot be considered a work because true faith involves a cessation of our works in the
flesh. True faith has as its object Jesus and His work on our behalf.

- The Holy Spirit is given to those who obey Jesus.
- The Holy Spirit is given to those who have faith in Jesus.

You can't have faith without obedience.

*John 7:17* -  If anyone's will is to do God's will, he will know whether the teaching is from God or whether I am speaking on my own authority.  (ESV)

Therefore, to arrive at the knowledge of the truth, you've got to have an obedient heart.I believe that the Holy Spirit goes to those who obey God. I believe belief in Jesus comes first but that is a work.

Acts 28:27: For the heart of this people has become dull, And with their ears they scarcely hear, And they have closed their eyes; Otherwise they might see with their eyes, And hear with their ears, And understand with their heart and return, And I would heal them.”’

Hebrews 9:14: how much more will the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself without blemish to God, purify our conscience from dead works to serve the living God.

The consensus must have been that works are good, but they have to be rooted in faith / the truth.

James 2:20: But are you willing to recognize, you foolish fellow, that faith without works is useless?

* Covenants - law (this is interesting)
[[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNHKqhwu6Bo][Public Debate - Should Christians Keep The Law? - YouTube]]

*Galatians 3:17* - This is what I mean: the law, which came 430 years afterward, does not annul a covenant previously ratified by God, so as to make the promise void,

*Deuteronomy 5:1-3* - And Moses summoned all Israel and said to them, "Hear, O Israel, the statutes and the rules that I speak in your hearing today, and you shall learn them and be careful to do them. The Lorb our God made a covenant with us in Horeb. Not with our fathers did the Lorp make this covenant, but with us, who are all of us here alive today."

*Galatians 3:19* - Why then the law? It was added because of transgressions, until the offspring  should come to whom the promise had been made, and it was put in place through angels by an intermediary.

* God's covenant with Abram
Genesis 17:1: When Abram was ninety-nine years old the Lord appeared to Abram and said to him, I am God Almighty; walk before me, and be blameless,
Genesis 17:2: that I may make my covenant between me and you, and may multiply you greatly.
Genesis 17:3: Then Abram fell on his face. And God said to him,
Genesis 17:4: Behold, my covenant is with you, and you shall be the father of a multitude of nations.
Genesis 17:5: No longer shall your name be called Abram, but your name shall be Abraham, for I have made you the father of a multitude of nations.
Genesis 17:6: I will make you exceedingly fruitful, and I will make you into nations, and kings shall come from you.
Genesis 17:7: And I will establish my covenant between me and you and your offspring after you throughout their generations for an everlasting covenant, to be God to you and to your offspring after you.

* Following the law by faith
Yeah, that's right. A good response to grace is to obey God's statutes - go and sin no more, as Jesus commanded. But it's God's Spirit which enables us to obey His statutes and meet the requirement of the law, rather than trying to follow the law by works. But there's nothing wrong with following the law as a lot of people say. But it's faith that justifies, not the works of the law. I try and remain accountable to God. For example, God knows if I lie, or cheat, or steal, or commit adultery - God knows; He can see it occurring in my heart when it happens. Therefore, I try to be obedient to God's commandments from the heart, and in truth and reality, not like a lawyer, but like someone who has a relationship with God and believes God exists and is a rewarder of those who seek Him. Also, God knows when I am faithful to Him by believing His word and obeying from the heart. I think following God's law in faith leads to meeting the requirement of the law. But following the law by works does not.

Ezekiel 11:19 - And I will give them one heart, and a new spirit I will put within them. I will remove the heart of stone from their flesh and give them a heart of flesh, (ESV)
Ezekiel 11:20 - that they may walk in my statutes and keep my rules and obey them. And they shall be my people, and I will be their God. (ESV)
Romans 7:22 - For I delight in the law of God, in my inner being, (ESV)
Romans 9:30-32 - What shall we say, then?  That Gentiles who did not pursue righteousness have attained it, that is, a righteousness that is by faith; but that Israel who pursued a law that would lead to righteousness did not succeed in reaching that law.  Why?  Because they did not pursue it by faith, but as if it were based on works.  They have stumbled over the stumbling stone, (ESV)
Romans 4:15-16 - For the law brings wrath, but where there is no law there is no transgression. That is why it depends on faith, in order that the promise may rest on grace and be guaranteed to all his offspring—not only to the adherent of the law but also to the one who shares the faith of Abraham, who is the father of us all, (ESV)

Since Jesus fulfilled the law, I believe this approach to obeying God's statutes is still having faith in Jesus.

* Justification by faith
AMEN!! You're not a false teacher for preaching Christ crucified.
Justification by faith is the correct teaching but please also know that the promise is for the gentiles AND the adherent of the law but they all must have faith, and pursuing the law as if by works is the problem, but pursuing the law by faith is ok. I'm also coming into all the truth - that is a process.

AMEN!! But I believe the faith that is unto righteousness is a trusting faith that has 'substance'/action. Also the faith that is unto righteousness results in good works. Also, faith without works is dead. One of the fruits of the Spirit is faithfulness. All God's works are done in faithfulness. So to say that one is saved by faith without any work/faithfulness/trust/repentance, doesn't sound true to me. But God is sovereign to save.

To follow the law in faith, you do it the right way, as Jesus did. Loving God and your neighbour. Being faithful to God. For example, when it means obeying God and not man.

Psalms 33:4-5 - For the word of the LORD is upright, and all his work is done in faithfulness.  He loves righteousness and justice; the earth is full of the steadfast love of the LORD.  (ESV)

Acts 5:29 - But Peter and the apostles answered, We must obey God rather than men.  (ESV)

Matthew 12:11-12 - He said to them, Which one of you who has a sheep, if it falls into a pit on the Sabbath, will not take hold of it and lift it out?  Of how much more value is a man than a sheep!  So it is lawful to do good on the Sabbath.  (ESV)

So in other words, instead of following as the Pharisees did, one should follow as Jesus did.
 @nolanwheaton839

But this doesn't mean the law is bad. Paul teaches the law is good. Also he said Israel did not pursue the law by faith, but they pursued the law by works. So if a person pursues the law the right way (by faith), it's no problem. The problem is that the people Paul pointed out hadn't attained the righteousness that is by faith through it, which he mentioned that some gentiles attained. If they pursued the law by faith then they would have arrived at Jesus and they would have loved Jesus.

*
I believe in the expensive grace of God.
Jesus Christ was crucified to pay the price for my sin.
The Holy Sprit is given to those who are obedient to Jesus.

Acts 5:27-32 - And when they had brought them, they set them before the council. And the high priest questioned them, saying, We strictly charged you not to teach in this name, yet here you have filled Jerusalem with your teaching, and you intend to bring this man's blood upon us. But Peter and the apostles answered, We must obey God rather than men. The God of our fathers raised Jesus, whom you killed by hanging him on a tree. God exalted him at his right hand as Leader and Savior, to give repentance to Israel and forgiveness of sins. And we are witnesses to these things, and so is the Holy Spirit, whom God has given to those who obey him. (ESV)

Galatians 3:24 - So then, the law was our guardian until Christ came, in order that we might be justified by faith. (ESV)

We are under the law of Christ.

1 Corinthians 9:21 - To those outside the law I became as one outside the law (not being outside the law of God but under the law of Christ) that I might win those outside the law. (ESV)

We must love one another as He has commanded us.

* God's statues / God's law is good
It's God who makes someone born-again of the
Spirit and puts His law on their heart.

There's nothing wrong with observing and
keeping God's statutes post-born-again.

In fact, our Saviour Jesus Christ encourages
it.

It's justification by faith and not
justification by faithlessness.

God is the justifier.

Jesus Christ is Lord and my Lord which means I
obey his commandments and love Him abide in
Him and abide in His love.

He is the Way, the Truth and the Life.

Romans 7:22 - For I delight in the law of God,
in my inner being, (ESV) Ezekiel 36:26-27 -
And I will give you a new heart, and a new
spirit I will put within you.

And I will remove the heart of stone from your
flesh and give you a heart of flesh.

And I will put my Spirit within you, and cause
you to walk in my statutes and be careful to
obey my rules.

(ESV) Matthew 5:18-22 - For truly, I say to
you, until heaven and earth pass away, not an
iota, not a dot, will pass from the Law until
all is accomplished.

Therefore whoever relaxes one of the least of
these commandments and teaches others to do
the same will be called least in the kingdom
of heaven, but whoever does them and teaches
them will be called great in the kingdom of
heaven.

For I tell you, unless your righteousness
exceeds that of the scribes and Pharisees, you
will never enter the kingdom of heaven.

You have heard that it was said to those of
old, You shall not murder; and whoever murders
will be liable to judgment.

But I say to you that everyone who is angry
with his brother will be liable to judgment;
whoever insults his brother will be liable to
the council; and whoever says, You fool! will
be liable to the hell of fire.

* Working for God
Romans 4:1-5 talks about justification through works vs justification through faith, so when it talks about working in Romans 4:4, having just mentioned in Romans 4:2 the phrase 'justified by works', when Paul says for the one who works, he probably means, for the one who works to seek justification.

And in Romans 4:5 I read this as meaning to the one who does not work for justification, but trusts him who justifies the ungodly, his faith is counted as righteousness.

That is totally fair because in Romans 4:2, Paul introduces works to the chapter in the phrase 'justified by works'.

My point is that working itself for God is good, and right, but not working for justification, but rather working for God while trusting that God has already justified the one who has faith in him.

Ephesians 4:28 - The one who steals must no longer steal; but rather he must labor, producing with his own hands what is good, so that he will have something to share with the one who has need.

Paul himself implies he seeks the favor of God and calls himself a bondservant of Christ.

Galatians 1:10 - For am I now seeking the favor of men, or of God?  Or am I striving to please men? If I were still trying to please men, I would not be a bond-servant of Christ.

But the works we have been given from God we should try to walk in.

The very works we do are done in faithful obedience to our Saviour.

God's works are also done in faithfulness.

Our works should be done in faithful obedience.

Psalms 33:4-5 - For the word of the LORD is upright, and all his work is done in faithfulness.  He loves righteousness and justice; the earth is full of the steadfast love of the LORD. (ESV)

While I agree with justification through faith alone, I disagree with 'stopping working' because we are created in Christ Jesus for good works. And that type of faith looks like repentance, faithfulness, good works, good fruit. So to say faith alone justifies without any works is ok but faith is not mutually exclusive with works!! And under my definition of faith, believing God is a first work of the heart. A person is born-again through the redemptive action of Jesus, born of the Spirit, and God has done that, not me. But to say a born-again Christian should not 'work' sounds a bit misleading. God rewards people who are faithful to Him. Also, repentance is a change of heart and that leads, as you say, to wanting to do good and stop sinning. So to me my definition of faith is at its most basic level simply belief, but then is characterised by faithfulness to that belief going forward because working out our salvation involves work and it involves faith, leaps of faith which bears action (e.g. coming to Jesus, faithfulness, repentance, trust in God)! That's the type of faith Abraham had which led him to put Isaac on the altar. Faith without works, or without faithfulness or repentance doesn't sound like faith to me and I can't give my endorsement that it would save. It sounds like finding the cheat code for a brand new video game you haven't played and then typing it in and winning the game and not playing the game but believing you've won, but I have very little faith in that type of faith, and it sounds extremely unfruitful. When I was born-again of the Spirit I was saved by grace. I didn't deserve it, but then, knowing what Jesus has said, I had to then humble myself and learn to walk in Jesus Christ's commandments. Jesus humbled Himself and obeyed God. We are supposed to do the same thing. The greatest in the kingdom will be your servant and all that.

I believe repentance (a change of heart) and coming to Jesus Christ for
forgiveness is the vital work/action which is needed as a part of faith to
qualify the faith. This isn't a work of the mosaic law. But it's a work. Luke
7:47 - Therefore I tell you, her sins, which are many, are forgiven—for she
loved much.  But he who is forgiven little, loves little.  (ESV) Luke 7:36-50 -
One of the Pharisees asked him to eat with him, and he went into the Pharisee's
house and took his place at the table. And behold, a woman of the city, who was
a sinner, when she learned that he was reclining at table in the Pharisee's
house, brought an alabaster flask of ointment, and standing behind him at his
feet, weeping, she began to wet his feet with her tears and wiped them with the
hair of her head and kissed his feet and anointed them with the ointment. Now
when the Pharisee who had invited him saw this, he said to himself, If this man
were a prophet, he would have known who and what sort of woman this is who is
touching him, for she is a sinner. And Jesus answering said to him, Simon, I
have something to say to you. And he answered, Say it, Teacher. A certain
moneylender had two debtors. One owed five hundred denarii, and the other
fifty. When they could not pay, he cancelled the debt of both. Now which of
them will love him more? Simon answered, The one, I suppose, for whom he
cancelled the larger debt. And he said to him, You have judged rightly. Then
turning toward the woman he said to Simon, Do you see this woman? I entered
your house; you gave me no water for my feet, but she has wet my feet with her
tears and wiped them with her hair. You gave me no kiss, but from the time I
came in she has not ceased to kiss my feet. You did not anoint my head with
oil, but she has anointed my feet with ointment. Therefore I tell you, her
sins, which are many, are forgiven—for she loved much. But he who is forgiven
little, loves little. And he said to her, Your sins are forgiven. Then those
who were at table with him began to say among themselves, Who is this, who even
forgives sins? And he said to the woman, Your faith has saved you; go in peace.

  The criminal next to Jesus on the cross, the

  Jesus has done no wrong, but he, the criminal,

People say we must live as Jesus did, obedient to God. What was Christ's obedience? He was obedient unto death on the cross.

Philippians 2:8

8 And being found in fashion as a man, he humbled himself, and became obedient unto death, even the death of the cross.

John 10:17-18

17 Therefore doth my Father love me, because I lay down my life, that I might take it again.

18 No man taketh it from me, but I lay it down of myself. I have power to lay it down, and I have power to take it again. This commandment have I received of my Father.

And what are we commanded to do?

1 John 3:23-24

23 And this is his commandment, That we should believe on the name of his Son Jesus Christ, and love one another, as he gave us commandment.

24 And he that keepeth his commandments dwelleth in him, and he in him. And hereby we know that he abideth in us, by the Spirit which he hath given us.

It's ALL about the gospel, the gospel is central. Obey (believe) the gospel!

According to Christian belief, Jesus is
considered the fulfillment of the covenant law
and the ultimate sacrifice for humanity's sins.

Jesus, the Son of God, fulfilled the Law in a way that no other could, bringing forth a masterpiece that changed the course of humanity.
He became the perfect sacrificial lamb, taking upon himself the world’s sins and offering redemption to all who believe in him.
Christ Jesus expounded on the deeper significance of the Law, showing us that it is not just a set of instructions, but a reflection of God's heart and a guide for righteous living.
As believers, we are called to follow in the footsteps of Jesus, to emulate his love and grace.
Jesus' fulfillment of the Law serves as a reminder that we are no longer bound by the letter of the Law, but are called to a higher standard of love and compassion.

Jude 1:4 (NASB) - For certain persons have crept in unnoticed, those who were long beforehand marked out for this condemnation, ungodly persons who turn the grace of our God into licentiousness and deny our only Master and Lord, Jesus Christ.

Luke 6:46 (NASB) - “Why do you call Me, ‘Lord, Lord,’ and do not do what I say?

Romans 3:27 (NASB) - Where then is boasting?  It is excluded.  By what kind of law?  Of works?  No, but by a law of faith.

Romans 4:18-25 (NASB) - In hope against hope he believed, so that he might become a father of many nations according to that which had been spoken, “So shall your descendants be.” Without becoming weak in faith he contemplated his own body, now as good as dead since he was about a hundred years old, and the deadness of Sarah’s womb; yet, with respect to the promise of God, he did not waver in unbelief but grew strong in faith, giving glory to God, and being fully assured that what God had promised, He was able also to perform.

Therefore it was also credited to him as righteousness.

Habakkuk 2:4 (NIV) - 4 “See, the enemy is puffed up; his desires are not upright— but the righteous person will live by his faithfulness[a]—

Now not for his sake only was it written that it was credited to him, but for our sake also, to whom it will be credited, as those who believe in Him who raised Jesus our Lord from the dead, He who was delivered over because of our transgressions, and was raised because of our justification.

For when Gentiles who do not have the Law do
instinctively the things of the Law, these,
not having the Law, are a law to themselves,

in their hearts, their conscience bearing

I'm not justified by Mosaic law. I still follow God's commandments, even ones from the Old Testament. I don't follow all of the Mosaic law. We are commanded to love the Lord our God with all our heart, soul, mind and strength, and our neighbour as ourself. We are commanded to put our faith in Christ. Faith in Christ is complimentary, not contradicting, to following God's commandments. I am not under a yoke of slavery, but I am under a yoke of willful obedience to God's commandments, particularly Jesus Christ's comandments. I follow Christ's commandments because I love Him. That shows that I am one of Christ's disciples.

@wassupmrdan - I believe you have the right attitude. I'm not justified by the Mosaic law. I'm justified by believing God sent His Son Jesus Christ, my Lord, to pay the price for my sin, and believing that I will be raised from the dead, as God raised Jesus from the dead. Calling someone one's Lord means following their commandments. I still follow God's commandments, even ones from the Old Testament. I don't follow all of the Mosaic law, however. We are commanded to love the Lord our God with all our heart, soul, mind and strength, and our neighbour as ourself. We are commanded to put our faith in Christ, and observe His commandments. Faith in Christ is complementary, not contradicting, to following God's commandments. I am not under a yoke of slavery, but I am under a yoke of willful obedience to God's commandments, particularly Jesus Christ's commandments. I follow Christ's commandments because I love Him. That shows that I am one of Christ's disciples. I want to imitate Christ. Therefore I'm going to act like Christ. And Christ loved God His Father by being obedient to His will. We can also love Father God by being obedient to His commandments. However, my Lord is Christ and I am faithful foremost to Christ, my only Teacher, Lord and Master and Christ is God's Only-Begotten Son, and Christ wants us to have faith both in Father God and Him (Christ). Also, good works is not the same thing as works of the law. Good works include bearing one-another's burdens as Christ has commanded. I'm not justified by those works. But I'm rewarded for those works and justified by faith in Jesus. The faith is made perfect by work, so to say justification is through faith without any work is incorrect, I think. But God is sovereign and may save who He will. You will know them by their fruit. Just remain faithful to Jesus. Love him in word and deed. Have the faith of Abraham.

Romans 10:20: And Isaiah is very bold and says, “I was found by those who did not seek Me, I became manifest to those who did not ask for Me.” - God is sovereign and will have mercy on who he has mercy on. One of the criminals on the cross next to Jesus was remorseful and feared God and had faith, and use his last moments well, and in genuine faith. Jesus promised him he would be in paradise. Abraham's belief was credited to him as righteousness *because* he did not waver in unbelief but grew strong in faith, giving glory to God. My understanding is like this: F (faith) = B (believing God) * f (faithfulness). The faith probably needs substance. But God is sovereign to save you. Faith in Christ is literally believing and being faithful to Christ. That faithfulness can be works of obedience to Christ's commandments, or can be works of faithfulness such as simply believing God and being unwavering to that belief, or a work of repentance, and unwavering belief. But to be faithlessness towards Christ is to *not* follow Christ's commandments. Believing in Christ is one of Christ's commandments, and His commandments came from God. Another of those commandments is to love one another the way He loved us. That's true faithfulness. That's true faith. Holding onto God's words and believing God and cherishing God's commandments and obeying them. But at the end of the day, it's God who gives the spirit to those who obey Him. Acts 5:32: And we are witnesses of these things, and also the Holy Spirit, whom God has given to those obeying Him." I am waiting on Jesus to deliver me from all trial. And until heaven and earth pass away or I go back to heaven, I will endeavour to remain faithful to Jesus Christ and His commandments for what he has told me to do on this earth. I believe I have been saved and are being saved. I am not holier than Jesus. I am a wretched sinner under grace with good works to carry out which God has had planned for me. But God has given me work to do, which I can carry out in faith to God because I believe He has already paid the price for me, and I'm now in grace. But I am going to be faithful to God and follow His commandments as well as I can in the way that Jesus followed them (i.e. to love God and my neighbour) especially since I am under grace and that's being faithful to God with the grace He has given me. I will observe God's commandments, even those from the Mosaic law. But I'm not under that law. Keep in mind the law points to Jesus Christ, along with the Psalms and the books of the Prophets. So it's still good to learn the law. But Christ has saved me from the curse of the law, and I don't follow the Mosaic law for justification. I'm justified through faith in Christ alone. And I do not teach others to violate or anull even the Mosaic law, unless God has declare something like making all food clean. I'm now under grace, living in grace, but not wanting to insult the spirit of grace. I don't say God's precepts are wrong, even the ones from Mosaic law. I'm still being led by Christ's Spirit. I'm yoked to Christ. This isn't a contradiction.

So you die to the law, once you accept Jesus as your Lord. You are a new creation in Jesus Christ and his nature will be inside you which will enable you to please God.

AMEN!!

But as I understand it we die to the Mosaic law but are under Christ's law. We went from the old covenant to the new covenant. It's like a marriage to Jesus where the law is faithfulness to Jesus. Grace isn't an excuse to sin. Jesus loved God his Father and his neighbour. We should imitate Christ. Therefore, there isn't a problem with observing and following God's commandments the way Jesus did, loving God and his neighbour. Luke 6:9 - And Jesus said to them, “I ask you, is it lawful to do good or to do harm on the Sabbath, to save a life or to destroy it?” Matthew 5:19-20 - Whoever then annuls one of the least of these commandments, and teaches others to do the same, shall be called least in the kingdom of heaven; but whoever keeps and teaches them, he shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven.  “For I say to you that unless your righteousness surpasses that of the scribes and Pharisees, you will not enter the kingdom of heaven.

Now Moses was pasturing the flock of Jethro
his father-in-law, the priest of Midian; and
he led the flock to the west side of the
wilderness and came to Horeb, the mountain of
God.

The angel of the LORD appeared to him in a
blazing fire from the midst of a bush; and he
looked, and behold, the bush was burning with
fire, yet the bush was not consumed.

So Moses said, “I must turn aside now and see
this marvelous sight, why the bush is not
burned up.” When the LORD saw that he turned
aside to look, God called to him from the
midst of the bush and said, “Moses, Moses!”
And he said, “Here I am.” Then He said, “Do
not come near here; remove your sandals from
your feet, for the place on which you are
standing is holy ground.” He said also, “I am
the God of your father, the God of Abraham,
the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.” Then
Moses hid his face, for he was afraid to look
at God.

The LORD said, “I have surely seen the
affliction of My people who are in Egypt, and
have given heed to their cry because of their
taskmasters, for I am aware of their
sufferings.

So I have come down to deliver them from the
power of the Egyptians, and to bring them up
from that land to a good and spacious land, to
a land flowing with milk and honey, to the
place of the Canaanite and the Hittite and the
Amorite and the Perizzite and the Hivite and
the Jebusite.

Now, behold, the cry of the sons of Israel has
come to Me; furthermore, I have seen the
oppression with which the Egyptians are
oppressing them.

Therefore, come now, and I will send you to
Pharaoh, so that you may bring My people, the
sons of Israel, out of Egypt.” But Moses said
to God, “Who am I, that I should go to
Pharaoh, and that I should bring the sons of
Israel out of Egypt?” And He said, “Certainly
I will be with you, and this shall be the sign
to you that it is I who have sent you: when
you have brought the people out of Egypt, you
shall worship God at this mountain.” Then
Moses said to God, “Behold, I am going to the
sons of Israel, and I will say to them, ‘The
God of your fathers has sent me to you.’ Now
they may say to me, ‘What is His name?’ What
shall I say to them?” God said to Moses, “I AM
WHO I AM”; and He said, “Thus you shall say to
the sons of Israel, ‘I AM has sent me to
you.’” God, furthermore, said to Moses, “Thus
you shall say to the sons of Israel, ‘The
LORD, the God of your fathers, the God of
Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of
Jacob, has sent me to you.’ This is My name
forever, and this is My memorial-name to all
generations.

Go and gather the elders of Israel together
and say to them, ‘The LORD, the God of your
fathers, the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob,
has appeared to me, saying, “I am indeed
concerned about you and what has been done to
you in Egypt.

So I said, I will bring you up out of the
affliction of Egypt to the land of the
Canaanite and the Hittite and the Amorite and
the Perizzite and the Hivite and the Jebusite,
to a land flowing with milk and honey.”’ They
will pay heed to what you say; and you with
the elders of Israel will come to the king of
Egypt and you will say to him, ‘The LORD, the
God of the Hebrews, has met with us.

So now, please, let us go a three days’
journey into the wilderness, that we may
sacrifice to the LORD our God.’ But I know
that the king of Egypt will not permit you to
go, except under compulsion.

So I will stretch out My hand and strike Egypt
with all My miracles which I shall do in the
midst of it; and after that he will let you
go.

I will grant this people favor in the sight of
the Egyptians; and it shall be that when you
go, you will not go empty-handed.

But every woman shall ask of her neighbor and
the woman who lives in her house, articles of
silver and articles of gold, and clothing; and
you will put them on your sons and daughters.

Thus you will plunder the Egyptians.” Then
Moses said, “What if they will not believe me
or listen to what I say?

For they may say, ‘The LORD has not appeared
to you.’” The LORD said to him, “What is that
in your hand?” And he said, “A staff.” Then He
said, “Throw it on the ground.” So he threw it
on the ground, and it became a serpent; and
Moses fled from it.

But the LORD said to Moses, “Stretch out your
hand and grasp it by its tail”--so he
stretched out his hand and caught it, and it
became a staff in his hand-- “that they may
believe that the LORD, the God of their
fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac,
and the God of Jacob, has appeared to you.”
The LORD furthermore said to him, “Now put
your hand into your bosom.” So he put his hand
into his bosom, and when he took it out,
behold, his hand was leprous like snow.

Then He said, “Put your hand into your bosom
again.” So he put his hand into his bosom
again, and when he took it out of his bosom,
behold, it was restored like the rest of his
flesh.

“If they will not believe you or heed the
witness of the first sign, they may believe
the witness of the last sign.

But if they will not believe even these two
signs or heed what you say, then you shall
take some water from the Nile and pour it on
the dry ground; and the water which you take
from the Nile will become blood on the dry
ground.” Then Moses said to the LORD, “Please,
Lord, I have never been eloquent, neither
recently nor in time past, nor since You have
spoken to Your servant; for I am slow of
speech and slow of tongue.” The LORD said to
him, “Who has made man’s mouth?

Or who makes him mute or deaf, or seeing or
blind?

Is it not I, the LORD?

Now then go, and I, even I, will be with your
mouth, and teach you what you are to say.” But
he said, “Please, Lord, now send the message
by whomever You will.” Then the anger of the
LORD burned against Moses, and He said, “Is
there not your brother Aaron the Levite?

I know that he speaks fluently.

And moreover, behold, he is coming out to meet
you; when he sees you, he will be glad in his
heart.

You are to speak to him and put the words in
his mouth; and I, even I, will be with your
mouth and his mouth, and I will teach you what
you are to do.

Moreover, he shall speak for you to the
people; and he will be as a mouth for you and
you will be as God to him.

You shall take in your hand this staff, with
which you shall perform the signs.”

Nice reply to his question, bro! Jesus indeed
is our Christ.

He is the Son of God.

Praise be to Father God for sending Jesus, so
we can have life in Him eternally.

Let’s now live a our life in obedience to His
commandment to love one another has he has
loved us, and lay our lives down for one
another, and to keep ourselves holy, in
worship to God, and live faithfully to Jesus,
and to stand up for his words and to stand up
for him and never deny him.

My life is not my own but belongs to Christ.

Now we can worship God by waiting on Him to
provide for our wants and needs, and we can
love our neighbour, giving mercy to others,
and forgiveness to others, as God has been
merciful and forgiving to us.

It is the right response towards God for His

A disposition to love somebody is one of the commonest feelings which
God has implanted in human nature. Too often, unhappily, people set
their affection on unworthy objects. I want this day to claim a place
for Him who alone is worthy of all our hearts' best feelings. I want men
to give some of their love to that divine Person who loved us, and gave
Himself for us. In all their loving I would have them not forget to Love
Christ.

The question which heads this message was addressed by Christ to the
apostle Peter. A more important question could not be asked. Eighteen
hundred years have passed away since the words were spoken. But to this
very day the inquiry is most searching and useful.

Suffer me to press this mighty subject upon the attention of every
reader of this message. This is no matter for mere enthusiasts and
fanatics. It deserves the consideration of every reasonable Christian
who believes the Bible. Our very salvation is bound up with it. Life or
death, heaven or hell, depend on our ability to answer the simple
question "Do you love Christ?"

There are two points which I wish to bring forward in opening up this
subject.

1. Let me show *the peculiar feeling of a true Christian towards
Christ*---he loves Him. A true Christian is not a mere baptized man or
woman. He is something more. He is not a person who only goes, as a
matter of form, to a church or chapel on Sundays, and lives all the rest
of the week as if there was no God. Formality is not Christianity.
Ignorant lip worship is not true religion. The Scripture speaks
expressly: "They are not all Israel which are of Israel" (Rom. 9:6). The
practical lesson of those words is clear and plain. All are not true
Christians who are members of the visible church of Christ.

The true Christian is one whose religion is in his heart and life. It is
felt by himself in his heart. It is seen by others in his conduct and
life. He feels his sinfulness, guilt and badness, and repents. He sees
Jesus Christ to be that divine Savior whom his soul needs, and commits
himself to Him. He puts off the old man with his corrupt and carnal
habits, and puts on the new man. He lives a new and holy life, fighting
habitually against the world, the flesh and the devil. Christ Himself is
the cornerstone of his Christianity. Ask him in what he trusts for the
forgiveness of his many sins, and he will tell you, in the death of
Christ. Ask him in what righteousness he hopes to stand innocent at the
judgment day, and he will tell you it is the righteousness of Christ.
Ask him by what pattern he tries to frame his life, and he will tell you
that it is the example of Christ.

But, beside all this, there is one thing in a true Christian which is
eminently peculiar to him. That thing is love to Christ. Knowledge,
faith, hope, reverence, obedience are all marked features in a true
Christian's character. But his picture would be very imperfect if you
omitted his "love" to his divine Master. He not only knows, trusts and
obeys. He goes further than this---he loves.

This peculiar mark of a true Christian is one which we find mentioned
several times in the Bible. "Faith towards our Lord Jesus Christ" is an
expression which many Christians are familiar with. Let it never be
forgotten that love is mentioned by the Holy Spirit in almost as strong
terms as faith. Great as the danger is of him "that believes not," the
danger of him that "loves not" is equally great. Not believing and not
loving are both steps to everlasting ruin.

Hear what Paul says to the Corinthians "If any man love not the Lord
Jesus Christ, let him be Anathema Maranatha" (1 Cor. 16:22). Paul allows
no way of escape to the man who does not love Christ. He leaves him no
loophole or excuse. A man may lack clear head--knowledge, and yet be
saved. He may fail in courage, and be overcome by the fear of man, like
Peter. He may fall tremendously, like David, and yet rise again. But if
a man does not love Christ, he is not in the way of life. The curse is
yet upon him. He is on the broad road that leads to destruction.

Remember ye not, that, when I was yet with

And now ye know what withholdeth that he might
be revealed in his time.

For the mystery of iniquity doth already work:
only he who now letteth will let, until he be

And then shall that Wicked be revealed, whom
the Lord shall consume with the spirit of his
mouth, and shall destroy with the brightness

For if we believe that Jesus died and rose
again, even so God will bring with Him those
who have fallen asleep in Jesus.

For this we say to you by the word of the
Lord, that we who are alive and remain until
the coming of the Lord, will not precede those
who have fallen asleep.

For the Lord Himself will descend from heaven
with a shout, with the voice of the archangel
and with the trumpet of God, and the dead in

Then we who are alive and remain will be

Do not be bound together with unbelievers; for

Or what harmony has Christ with Belial, or

For we are the temple of the living God; just
as God said, “I will dwell in them and walk

“Therefore, come out from their midst and be

Jesus came down from heaven.
God reached out to us and broke down the barrier to us knowing Him.
God exposed himself to us in a way that looks like vulnerability.
But "Not by might, nor by power but by My Spirit, says the LORD."
God demonstrates His power through what may appear like vulnerability.
Consider the story of Gideon.
Consider Jesus allowing Himself to be fleeced, but Jesus did not fight back.
He took mankind's sin upon Himself.

For what does the Scripture say?

“Abraham believed God, and it was credited to
him as righteousness.” Now to the one who
works, his wage is not credited as a favor,
but as what is due.

But to the one who does not work, but believes
in Him who justifies the ungodly, his faith is
credited as righteousness,

(NASB)
#+end_src

But the above is not an excuse to do no work! We are meant to walk in the works which God has planned for us!

The point here is we are not doing favors to God for working,
but it's what is due.

So the verse is often misinterpreted.

So we need the righteousness of God through faith first, and that involves repentance.

‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾
Behold, the LORD’S hand is not so short That
it cannot save; Nor is His ear so dull That it
cannot hear.

But your iniquities have made a separation
between you and your God, And your sins have
hidden His face from you so that He does not
hear.

For your hands are defiled with blood And your
fingers with iniquity; Your lips have spoken
falsehood, Your tongue mutters wickedness.

No one sues righteously and no one pleads
honestly.

They trust in confusion and speak lies; They
conceive mischief and bring forth iniquity.

They hatch adders’ eggs and weave the spider’s
web; He who eats of their eggs dies, And from
that which is crushed a snake breaks forth.

Their webs will not become clothing, Nor will
they cover themselves with their works; Their
works are works of iniquity, And an act of
violence is in their hands.

Their feet run to evil, And they hasten to
shed innocent blood; Their thoughts are
thoughts of iniquity, Devastation and
destruction are in their highways.

They do not know the way of peace, And there
is no justice in their tracks; They have made
their paths crooked, Whoever treads on them
does not know peace.

Therefore justice is far from us, And
righteousness does not overtake us; We hope
for light, but behold, darkness, For
brightness, but we walk in gloom.

We grope along the wall like blind men, We
grope like those who have no eyes; We stumble
at midday as in the twilight, Among those who
are vigorous we are like dead men.

All of us growl like bears, And moan sadly
like doves; We hope for justice, but there is
none, For salvation, but it is far from us.

For our transgressions are multiplied before
You, And our sins testify against us; For our
transgressions are with us, And we know our
iniquities: Transgressing and denying the
LORD, And turning away from our God, Speaking
oppression and revolt, Conceiving in and
uttering from the heart lying words.

Justice is turned back, And righteousness
stands far away; For truth has stumbled in the
street, And uprightness cannot enter.

Yes, truth is lacking; And he who turns aside
from evil makes himself a prey.

Now the LORD saw, And it was displeasing in
His sight that there was no justice.

And He saw that there was no man, And was
astonished that there was no one to intercede;
Then His own arm brought salvation to Him, And
His righteousness upheld Him.

The LORD will command the blessing upon you in

The LORD will establish you as a holy people

The LORD will open for you His good
storehouse, the heavens, to give rain to your
land in its season and to bless all the work
of your hand; and you shall lend to many
nations, but you shall not borrow.

The LORD will make you the head and not the

commandments of the LORD your God, which I
charge you today, to observe them carefully,
and do not turn aside from any of the words

* The works of faith
Believing on Jesus Christ's name as the Son of God, Lord, Saviour and Messiah
and accepting him as *your* Saviour, means accepting that you are
a sinner, and accepting him as your Lord means accepting that you're going
to follow his commandments.

Therefore, the first work is accepting this. It is the first act of repentance, which is metanoia (or a change of heart and mind). And that is what it is to believe on Him / His name. Believing on His name
is an act of faith that requires work which is a change of heart.

After that, faith requires continuing in the works of faith.
The works of faith is faith working through love.
And faith is faithfulness to what God has said, even when nobody is watching.
For example, if you want to be faithful to what God has said,
then after reading one of Jesus' commandments, one may then be tested
on it, and faithfulness is doing the right thing with respect to
what God has told you, knowing God is observing, but it is you
who are accepting and desiring to be accountable to Him.
It's obedience to the Lord Jesus Christ through hearing his commandments
and obeying, in any situation,
and it is not prideful to follow His commandments because
His commandments are about being a servant, loving people selflessly,
humbly and mercifully.

** There is no pride / self-righteousness in faith - and the just shall live by faith
So works are not about self-righteousness leading to pride,
but rather obedience leading to glorifying God.
It's not prideful to work; it's obedience to the gospel because it's
every moment making Him your Lord and Saviour.
There's no pride in following Jesus' commandments because
Jesus' commandments instruct us to love selflessly and in humility.

  True faith has work. Faith without any work is
  not faith at all. Faith without work is like
  force without mass or acceleration. That work
  may be as simple as recognising you are a
  sinner, and repenting and seeking Saviour
  Jesus. That work might be humbling oneself and
  forgiving people. We are meant to obey the
  gospel. Justification through faith is only
  the beginning; after that should come
  obedience. Obeying the gospel involves work.
  It's faith + works. A true change of heart is
  work. Obedience to Jesus is believing Jesus is
  the Son of God and the Messiah, and loving
  one-another the way He loved us. See first
  John. You will know them by their fruit. Why
  do you call Jesus Lord and not do as He says?
  The Apostle John clearly states that those who
  do not practice Jesus' commandments but claim
  to know Jesus are liars. Jesus said if you
  love Him you will follow His commandments. His
  commandments are about believing on Him, and
  who He is, and trusting Him and obeying Him
  and loving one another the WAY He loved us -
  selflessly, mercifully, forgivingly. Obeying
  Him is obeying His commandments such as love
  your enemies, not only your friends. Give to
  the one that asks. Come to know Him through
  obedience to the gospel, then go out and share
  the gospel.

  You here miss that it's about our faith on
  Jesus' works. Jesus fulfilled the law for us.
  If you live after the law(trust in your faulty
  obedience) you will be judged by your works.
  If you live after the grace(trust in Jesus'
  perfect obedience) you will be judged by
  Jesus' works. Obeying the gospel is to believe
  on Jesus!

  Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that
  heareth my word, and believeth on him that
  sent me, hath everlasting life, and shall not
  come into condemnation; but is passed from
  death unto life. John 5:24

  That's only the starting point. God the Father
  said when Jesus was baptised, "This is my
  beloved Son, listen to Him." So why didn't God
  the Father say it all then? Because He
  requires us to listen to Jesus Christ's word,
  and it's more than just John 5:24. A person is
  saved, but then comes sanctification and
  glorification. After being saved through faith
  comes walking in that faith which is faith
  WORKING through love. Whatever done without
  faith is sin, even works. But faith without
  works is dead. God the Father is merciful and
  just. The Father sent Jesus as grace and truth
  into the world showing His mercy but next time
  it will be justice to judge. 2 Corinthians
  5:10 -"For we must all appear before the
  judgment seat of Christ, so that each one may
  be recompensed for his deeds in the body,
  according to what he has done, whether good or
  bad." By God's grace we can be obedient to the
  gospel. Jesus' sheep are those who have love
  for one another - the same type of love Christ
  had for us. Faith without works is dead.
  Ephesians 2:10 - For we are His workmanship,
  created in Christ Jesus for good works, which
  God prepared beforehand so that we would walk
  in them. Even the sinner on the cross next to
  Jesus had faith+works because the work was a
  repentant heart, and being able to publicly
  repent using his last words. So-called 'faith'
  without acknowledging your own sin and turning
  from it is dead and can't save. You can't
  receive grace without recognising you're a
  sinner. You can't be saved without a Saviour.
  But upon receiving the grace, we are supposed
  to glorify Christ with our works. Basic
  salvation is faith alone. But true faith alone
  has at least some work. The saving grace is
  gratis, but then God judges on works that
  comes after having received the grace.

  AMEN by the way... All glory to Jesus Christ

  nothing but Jesus Christ. I would be able to
  do nothing if not for God who strengthens me.
  I would not have been able to even repent if
  it wasn't for the love and grace God
  abundantly gave me. I have no good works aside
  from what Jesus has given me to walk in, and
  even such good works I could've done better at
  doing! And they're only good enough for God
  because God is good and He gave them to me to
  walk in. Obeying the gospel is to believe on
  Jesus Christ - AMEN to that! It's the first
  step. I do believe that entails believing that
  He is one's Saviour, and that one needs a
  Saviour. The next step is I think getting to
  know Him through walking in love as he
  described it and following the leading of His
  Holy Spirit. Thanks be the Holy Spirit of God
  for leading me into truth one step at a time,
  and into a closer relationship with Jesus. I

‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾
Wives, be subject to your own husbands, as to
the Lord.

For the husband is the head of the wife, as
Christ also is the head of the church, He
Himself being the Savior of the body.

But as the church is subject to Christ, so
also the wives ought to be to their husbands
in everything.

Husbands, love your wives, just as Christ also
loved the church and gave Himself up for her,
so that He might sanctify her, having cleansed
her by the washing of water with the word,
that He might present to Himself the church in
all her glory, having no spot or wrinkle or
any such thing; but that she would be holy and
blameless.

So husbands ought also to love their own wives
as their own bodies.

He who loves his own wife loves himself; for
no one ever hated his own flesh, but nourishes
and cherishes it, just as Christ also does the
church, because we are members of His body.

For this reason a man shall leave his father
and mother and shall be joined to his wife,
and the two shall become one flesh.

This mystery is great; but I am speaking with
reference to Christ and the church.

Nevertheless, each individual among you also
is to love his own wife even as himself, and
the wife must see to it that she respects her
husband.

not committing adultery comes from a heart which has no love for God (which it does in millions of
chaste spouses), if not committing adultery that has no love or God and a heart that does not treasure God above all things

For not knowing about God’s righteousness and

subject themselves to the righteousness of
God.

For Christ is the end of the law for
righteousness to everyone who believes.

For Moses writes that the man who practices
the righteousness which is based on law shall
live by that righteousness.

But the righteousness based on faith speaks as
follows: “Do not say in your heart, ‘Who will
ascend into heaven?’ (that is, to bring Christ
down), or ‘Who will descend into the abyss?’
(that is, to bring Christ up from the dead).”
But what does it say?

“The word is near you, in your mouth and in
your heart”--that is, the word of faith which
we are preaching, that if you confess with
your mouth Jesus as Lord, and believe in your
heart that God raised Him from the dead, you
will be saved; for with the heart a person
believes, resulting in righteousness, and with
the mouth he confesses, resulting in
salvation.

For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven
against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of
men who suppress the truth in unrighteousness,
because that which is known about God is
evident within them; for God made it evident
to them.

For since the creation of the world His
invisible attributes, His eternal power and
divine nature, have been clearly seen, being
understood through what has been made, so that
they are without excuse.

For even though they knew God, they did not
honor Him as God or give thanks, but they
became futile in their speculations, and their
foolish heart was darkened.

Professing to be wise, they became fools, and
exchanged the glory of the incorruptible God
for an image in the form of corruptible man
and of birds and four-footed animals and
crawling creatures.

Therefore God gave them over in the lusts of
their hearts to impurity, so that their bodies
would be dishonored among them.

For they exchanged the truth of God for a lie,
and worshiped and served the creature rather
than the Creator, who is blessed forever.

Amen.

For this reason God gave them over to
degrading passions; for their women exchanged
the natural function for that which is
unnatural, and in the same way also the men
abandoned the natural function of the woman
and burned in their desire toward one another,
men with men committing indecent acts and
receiving in their own persons the due penalty
of their error.

And just as they did not see fit to
acknowledge God any longer, God gave them over
to a depraved mind, to do those things which
are not proper, being filled with all
unrighteousness, wickedness, greed, evil; full
of envy, murder, strife, deceit, malice; they
are gossips, slanderers, haters of God,
insolent, arrogant, boastful, inventors of
evil, disobedient to parents, without
understanding, untrustworthy, unloving,
unmerciful; and although they know the
ordinance of God, that those who practice such
things are worthy of death, they not only do
the same, but also give hearty approval to
those who practice them.

Jesus spoke these things; and lifting up His
eyes to heaven, He said, “Father, the hour has
come; glorify Your Son, that the Son may
glorify You, even as You gave Him authority
over all flesh, that to all whom You have
given Him, He may give eternal life.

This is eternal life, that they may know You,
the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom You
have sent.

I glorified You on the earth, having
accomplished the work which You have given Me
to do.

Now, Father, glorify Me together with
Yourself, with the glory which I had with You
before the world was.

“I have manifested Your name to the men whom
You gave Me out of the world; they were Yours
and You gave them to Me, and they have kept
Your word.

Now they have come to know that everything You
have given Me is from You; for the words which
You gave Me I have given to them; and they
received them and truly understood that I came
forth from You, and they believed that You
sent Me.

I ask on their behalf; I do not ask on behalf
of the world, but of those whom You have given
Me; for they are Yours; and all things that
are Mine are Yours, and Yours are Mine; and I
have been glorified in them.

I am no longer in the world; and yet they
themselves are in the world, and I come to
You.

Holy Father, keep them in Your name, the name
which You have given Me, that they may be one
even as We are.

While I was with them, I was keeping them in
Your name which You have given Me; and I
guarded them and not one of them perished but
the son of perdition, so that the Scripture
would be fulfilled.

But now I come to You; and these things I
speak in the world so that they may have My
joy made full in themselves.

I have given them Your word; and the world has
hated them, because they are not of the world,
even as I am not of the world.

I do not ask You to take them out of the
world, but to keep them from the evil one.

They are not of the world, even as I am not of
the world.

Sanctify them in the truth; Your word is
truth.

As You sent Me into the world, I also have
sent them into the world.

For their sakes I sanctify Myself, that they
themselves also may be sanctified in truth.

“I do not ask on behalf of these alone, but
for those also who believe in Me through their
word; that they may all be one; even as You,
Father, are in Me and I in You, that they also
may be in Us, so that the world may believe
that You sent Me.

The glory which You have given Me I have given
to them, that they may be one, just as We are
one; I in them and You in Me, that they may be
perfected in unity, so that the world may know
that You sent Me, and loved them, even as You
have loved Me.

Father, I desire that they also, whom You have
given Me, be with Me where I am, so that they
may see My glory which You have given Me, for
You loved Me before the foundation of the
world.

“O righteous Father, although the world has
not known You, yet I have known You; and these
have known that You sent Me; and I have made
Your name known to them, and will make it
known, so that the love with which You loved
Me may be in them, and I in them.”

‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾
And you were dead in your trespasses and sins,
in which you formerly walked according to the
course of this world, according to the prince
of the power of the air, of the spirit that is
now working in the sons of disobedience.

Among them we too all formerly lived in the
lusts of our flesh, indulging the desires of
the flesh and of the mind, and were by nature
children of wrath, even as the rest.

But God, being rich in mercy, because of His
great love with which He loved us, even when
we were dead in our transgressions, made us
alive together with Christ (by grace you have
been saved), and raised us up with Him, and
seated us with Him in the heavenly places in
Christ Jesus, so that in the ages to come He
might show the surpassing riches of His grace
in kindness toward us in Christ Jesus.

For by grace you have been saved through
faith; and that not of yourselves, it is the
gift of God; not as a result of works, so that
no one may boast.

For we are His workmanship, created in Christ
Jesus for good works, which God prepared
beforehand so that we would walk in them.

Therefore remember that formerly you, the
Gentiles in the flesh, who are called
“Uncircumcision” by the so-called
“Circumcision,” which is performed in the
flesh by human hands-- remember that you were
at that time separate from Christ, excluded
from the commonwealth of Israel, and strangers
to the covenants of promise, having no hope
and without God in the world.

But now in Christ Jesus you who formerly were
far off have been brought near by the blood of
Christ.

For He Himself is our peace, who made both
groups into one and broke down the barrier of
the dividing wall, by abolishing in His flesh
the enmity, which is the Law of commandments
contained in ordinances, so that in Himself He
might make the two into one new man, thus
establishing peace, and might reconcile them
both in one body to God through the cross, by
it having put to death the enmity.

And He came and preached peace to you who were
far away, and peace to those who were near;
for through Him we both have our access in one
Spirit to the Father.

So then you are no longer strangers and
aliens, but you are fellow citizens with the
saints, and are of God’s household, having
been built on the foundation of the apostles
and prophets, Christ Jesus Himself being the
corner stone, in whom the whole building,
being fitted together, is growing into a holy
temple in the Lord, in whom you also are being
built together into a dwelling of God in the
Spirit.

Father we're here to talk about living by faith in future grace and so I ask for that now, for me, that I would trust YOu for three hours
worth of future grace, and that it would come with power, with wisdom, with humility, with courage, that it would strip away all fear  of man
and all self-exultation and it would abound with memory of the precious things in the Word of God and in the history of the world with the
cross at its center.
ANd for those who are here in this room and for those watching, I pray also for future grace for some for the next five minute sbefore they turn it off
and for others the whole time.
LORD, there will be no understanding, ther ewill be no grasping , there will be no embraacing or cherishing or treasuring if Your grace does not come.
And so we ask for it because YOu said, "Ask and you will receive, seek and you will find, knock and the door will be opened." And so we're asking,
and seeking and knocking. We're not blundering ahead with any sense of self-sufficiency or self-reliance in this moment.
We are cassting ourselves now upon You for the sustaining of the technology which is the least iimportant and Your sustaining of our faith
which is the most important in our lives. So I pray now that You'd come and do all that of the glory of Jesus, I pray, AMEN!!
