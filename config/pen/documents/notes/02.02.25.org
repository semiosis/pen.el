Dear Heavenly Father, and my Lord Jesus Christ,
Jehovah God,
please, LORD God, help me to know what You want me to do.
LORD God, I have been committing my way to You,
and I would really like You to provide for me.
Please, God, provide for me.
LORD God, I've been robbed from, and it's really difficult for me because
after being robbed I'm also being tormented and reminded, and pushed into sin.
That isn't good or OK.
It's the opposite of sanctification.
It's flipping evil, really.
Please, God, in Jesus Christ's name set me free from those antichrist spirits which have been harassing me.
It's really not OK, LORD God.
Please, LORD, speak to me clearly in Jesus Christ's name I ask.
In Jesus Christ's name I ask and pray,
AMEN!!


Dear Heavenly Father, and my Lord Jesus Christ,
why have You not taken me up, LORD?
I hate this life of mine, LORD God.
You've allowed demons to rob me of what makes it worthwhile.
Please, God, would You help me?
I'm sick of this, God.
I'm sick of this satanic harassment.
Please, God, in Jesus Christ's name, begin improving my situation by speaking to me
and testifying of Jesus Christ, as I've asked of You many, many times.
In Jesus Christ's name I ask, please just make testimony of Jesus.
In Jesus Christ's name I pray. AMEN!!
