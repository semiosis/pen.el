Dear Heavenly Father and my Lord Jesus Christ and Holy Spirit,
Jehovah God,
please, God, in Jesus Christ's name heal me, and deliver me.
Please, God, don't keep me in this horrible situation.
I want to be healed.
I do not understand why I've been placed in this situation.
It's not fair, LORD.
In Jesus Christ's name I ask,
AMEN!!


Dear Heavenly Father, and my Lord Jesus Christ, and Holy Spirit,
Jehovah God,
please, LORD, in Jesus Christ's name please help me.
Please, God, deliver me.
Please do not make me go another day with the spiritual attack I have been getting.
Please give me grace, God.
Please, LORD God, deliver me in Jesus Christ's name.
I want to be delivered immediately in Jesus Christ's name.
Please, God, stop allowing my genitals to be attacked.
I'm really sick of it.
I want to be delivered right now.
Please, God, put an end to the ridiculous hate against me, the hate which is preventing me from being able to work and marry and preventing me
from being able to hear clearly from You.
Please, God, I need grace.
Please give me grace in Jesus Christ's name.
AMEN!!
