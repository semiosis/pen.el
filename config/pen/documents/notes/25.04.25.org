ANZAC Day

Dear Heavenly Father, and my Lord Jesus Christ, and Holy Spirit,
Jehovah, Almighty God,
please set me free, LORD.
Please, God, set me free.
I feel sick from getting tossed around, spiritually.
God, there is so much going on which does not seem good.
Please, God, heal Kieren's foot, LORD.
And please, God, keep walking with Carl.
Please, God, bring unity to Your church, in Your love.
In Jesus Christ's name I ask,
AMEN!!

+ 1Clem 49:5 ::  Love joineth us unto God; love covereth a multitude of sins; love endureth all things, is long-suffering in all things. There is nothing coarse, nothing arrogant in love. Love hath no divisions, love maketh no seditions, love doeth all things in concord. In love were all the elect of God made perfect; without love nothing is well pleasing to God:

Dear Heavenly Father, and my Lord Jesus Christ, and Holy Spirit,
Jehovah God,
please, LORD, let me sleep properly.
LORD God, I'm so sick of being woken up during the night to evil dreams and visions.
Please, God, in Jesus Christ's name deliver me,
AMEN!!

Dear Heavenly Father, and my Lord Jesus Christ, and Holy Spirit,
Jehovah God,
