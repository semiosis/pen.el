But I have this against you, that you tolerate that woman Jezebel, who calls herself a prophetess and is teaching and seducing my servants to practice sexual immorality and to eat food sacrificed to idols. I gave her time to repent, but she refuses to repent of her sexual immorality. Behold, I will throw her onto a sickbed, and those who commit adultery with her I will throw into great tribulation, unless they repent of her works, and I will strike her children dead. And all the churches will know that I am he who searches mind and heart, and I will give to each of you as your works deserve. But to the rest of you in Thyatira, who do not hold this teaching, who have not learned what some call the deep things of Satan, to you I say, I do not lay on you any other burden.

The word "end" doesn't mean abolishment. It means more like "ultimate" or "fulfillment" or in context I think it means "final say" or even "foundation" or "cornerstone".
So for those who have an agape-loving faith in Jesus Christ, a treasuring for the truth of the gospel, the free gift of righteousness that comes from God ultimately has the final say in judgement. In other words, the righteousness that is not of themselves but which is a free gift through faith in Christ based on His work alone has the ultimate say and also is the foundation for any other righteousness of a believer, such as persecution for the cross of Christ, and if all other righteousness fails, there is still no condemnation.

The true gospel which we should be preaching so as to not be accursed is the gospel the Apostle Paul preached where we are supposed to have faith in Christ, hold fast in that faith as we are being saved, serve Christ, obey Christ and be strengthened by Christ, Christ who's blood was shed, who died for our sins on a tree and rose from the dead. Like the bedrock of a house strengthens the foundations of the house which strengthens the remainder of the house, the cornerstone (faith alone in Jesus Christ's blood) strengthens the foundations (laid while practicing Jesus' commandments) which strengthens the rest of the house, the house that is the eternal dwelling that I believe God builds for those who practice Jesus' commandments.

  positions. Uh some of our viewers wanted
  to know just in general if you had any
  comments on the state of our uh of our
  nation, but uh in particular uh some
  viewers expressed concern regarding
  Trump's support for the uh LGBT um
  so-called community um and uh are
  concerned, father, maybe that that is
  not uh that's not discussed enough. Uh
  maybe there's some compromise on that.
  Maybe there's some willingness to to
  overlook his uh support of this uh of
  the LGBT crowds. Any any thoughts on
  that? Well, it would be a tragic mistake
  to overlook these things. I mean it is
  because possessed because of these
  perversions this
  immorality whether it be in virtual in
  in vitro fertilization
  uh with the tens of thousands of
  conceived children embryos who are now
  frozen in labor laboratories
  u and these are businesses these are
  money-making businesses here that are
  behind this and that are actually um
  just you actually housing these and
  freezing these and suspended animation,
  but they are identifiably human
  offspring. Um that's very evil. Uh you
  know, we we condemn the millions of
  children who've died through abortion.
  We condemn that abort aborting these
  children.
  And it's just not possible consistently
  logically to approve in virtual
  fertilization if you consider the child
  in the womb to a human and condemn the
  murder of that
  child. Um there's obviously something
  going on here. Now you know Trump is not
  a Catholic. He doesn't think as a
  Catholic. He's not been trained raised
  as a Catholic. And so it is uh not
  reasonable for us to expect him to
  conduct himself as a Catholic. We'd like
  him to. We pray for that. So, but we
  shouldn't be shocked to find out that he
  doesn't understand certain
  things. Um but we can't justify them. We
  can't say, "Oh, well, it doesn't count
  because he doesn't think like a
  Catholic, so it doesn't matter." It does
  matter. This is precisely the kind of
  thing that draws God's wrath down upon
  our country. From a spiritual point of
  view, these are extremely evil things
  and we have to impose them, oppose them
  with all of our might. Um the difference
  though, and I I'd say in my mind the
  difference between the Trump
  administration and what has preceded it
  is that we have the liberty of speech to
  oppose these things and to condemn these
  things. Whereas the previous
  administration and what was threatened
  to be the present administration
  following the other is that we would not
  have any liberty to condemn these
  things. Uh but the fact is we do have
  the liberty to condemn these evil things
  uh the perversions that we're talking
  about here.
  Um, so I guess we need to realize the
  obligation we have to do so. In other
  words, it's one thing for me to say,
  yes, how wonderful we have the liberty
  and the freedom of speech now to condemn
  the things that we find wrong, wrong
  with our government, wrong with our
  politicians, uh, wrong with our state
  policy and so on. We as Americans have
  the power and the right to resist these
  things and to denounce these things and
  then we don't do it. So we're culpable,
  very culpable in God's eyes if he's
  given us now the liberty to speak up and
  to speak forcefully and condemn these
  things and try to rally our American
  people for the what is right and to
  condemn what is wrong.
  If we fail to do that, then we're the
  ones responsible.

This is so cool what is happening over in the USA. Praise God! I think my heart just softened a bit more towards Trump after seeing the sincerity in his eyes and voice and words and reverence for God, and I'm encouraged by what's happening at the White House these days. Listening to him confess elementary doctrine of Christ, and seeing his reverence for Father God and the Lord Jesus Christ, and for Jesus' words, and his faith in Jesus' atoning sacrifice and having witnessed that he has heard the cornerstone of the gospel of Jesus and how we are called to love as Jesus did, and seeing him give due reverance for the Lord and Trump still confessing his faith in God through Jesus, I'm convinced the man is a genuine Christian with a sincere faith in the Lord Jesus Christ. After listening to him and hearing what he had to say, and his belief in Jesus' atoning sacrifice, His death and resurrection, it eases so much anxiety I had. It's easy to despair when the world gets so dark because there's not a lot of light in it. Jesus is the light of the world and Christ's disciples are also the light of the world. Gotta keep that light shining.

There's no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus, even for infants in Christ. It's so good to have Christian leadership in the US, and I'm glad that Trump is also fellowshipping and listening to Christians who are strong in their faith, and I'm glad that JD Vance is in office, and also I'm happy that Roman Catholicism is being represented alongside Protestantism. If I was a US citizen then Trump would have my vote. As for political and economic chaos, it's to be expected for a change of policy turning away from ungodliness towards faith in God through Jesus. We walk by faith in God, trusting God and not sight! We gotta put God first, we gotta treasure God, love and treasure Jesus before anything or anyone else and build our lives on the rock on the foundation of Christ and His commandments. Can't let our foundations be compromised or the whole thing will rot. Jesus is the Way the Truth and the Life. Praise God.

Hey Elliot bro,
man I got attacked so bad this morning I'm despairing and freaking out, and so I gotta email you. I just don't know how to get back to being OK. I really would appreciate your prayers and stuff and solidarity with doing war against sin and stuff. I might have to go talk to Adson cos I feel like I'm just at the point of feeling like I need to get on top of this or I'm going to die. I feel like I'm actually losing this battle against sin...
It's awful... I wake up to these dream attacks, which manifest into these physical attacks.
It's really difficult to talk what's going on because sin is sin and talking about sin is really disgusting.
I feel defiled and as though I'm not in control of it - it's like a disease that's been getting worse.
I've noticed that I'm getting a lot of haptic feedback from my dreams and reality, and I think it's really demonic,
and extremely adversarial - like something which has been trying to prevent me with all its might from me getting delivered.
It's extremely demonic.
Like if I need sleep, I get woken up.
If I need to talk to a pastor, then there's something that tries to prevent me from having that conversation.
Whatever I need, I get the opposite.
It's so satanic, man.

I remember when I did battle against vaping. God helped me after I got born-again.
I'm fighting for my life over this sin stuff. What I'm going through now is far than being enslaved to nicotine.
Sexual purity is extremely important.

I'm going to try to go on a fast this week.
I need to do battle against this thing man, cos this "spirit spouse" stuff feels like it's trying to take over my body,
and the dream attacks are very strong now and difficult to force out of my mind, even by singing worship music in my mind - it's as if something is trying to control my mind and make me think lewd thoughts in the morning.
I've literally been waking up to some of the most antichrist dreams and visions, stuff that's just directly opposed to everything I pray to God for deliverance from,
and yesterday morning and this morning, just sounds of people having orgasm and men having sex with men, and a whole raft of disturbing, evil stuff.
I don't know how satan is able to do this. It's wearing me down.

I have to let you know bro that the spiritual attack I've been getting has escalated to something very severe and I'm trying to do war against it.
It literally feels like there is someone else, this entity "sin", forcing lewd thoughts into my head, and make me feel sensations of having sex while I'm lying down - that is what I've been experiencing and the issue is I feel spiritually and mentally weak to the point where I'm losing the ability to overcome it.
It feels like being possessed by a demon, except that when I walking around at day, the spiritual attack becomes different, I get attacked through confrontations with other people.
Every day I'm begging Jesus to deliver me, and even when I go to bed feeling OK with a song in my heart, in the morning it feels like my brain is completely overrun by infestation, as if demons had invaded my body and mind while I was sleeping.
I've noticed some of you guys may be getting influenced directly/indirectly by this stuff too even if you don't perceive it.
I think we need to be collectively just going to war against sexual sin, and agreeing with what the Word says about various things,
rather than giving sin/satan/demons entry points by endorsing sinful things.
It's spiritual and so is communion, sharing food as brothers in Christ, so unsurprising that it would be affecting the others in the dgroup. One of the more recent times I talked to Quin we had agreed on how sin doesn't just affect the one person who does it.

I don't know what to do about this other than prayer and fasting. Through the whole of lent I didn't fast from food but instead every morning I just had these pictures and visions, and thoughts of eating food. The spiritual warfare is constantly like this - adversarial.
It's just this evil entity constantly trying to un-born-again me, trying to make my obedience to Christ into disobedience, trying to steal my thoughts from being on Christ to being on darkness. How do I get rid of this thing which keeps attacking me? Maybe prayer and fasting.
I have a really bad case of demonic oppression, man.

Before being born-again this type of stuff never happened.
Man, it felt like I was the one in control of my soul - emotions, thoughts, etc. even physical sensations and the control of my body.
It never fought against me like the way it does now.
It terrifies me, man.

I know we all carry our own issues at dgroup and none of us are perfect
I think I should be staying away from people who are not taking sexual purity seriously
because I believe that in a way similar to how we confess our sins to one another to be healed, I think that when people strive in the opposite direction
and they strive to affirm sinful things as nonsinful it works against the cause.

Because I'm feeling overrun and because it was like much worse today if I remember then I'm going to bring up the whole sexual purity thing at dgroup.
That's for like also bringing it up as an issue.
It's encouraging to hear from Matt that he'd made progress like avoiding porn for a few weeks.
I haven't gone near porn for like 3 years now, but what's been going on with me is similar to what happened with me during lent regarding just getting flooded with visions of eating food.
The spiritual attack I've been getting, feelings and sensations of being groped and brought to orgasm and head flooded with these evil, disgusting dreams on the verge of waking up - I strongly believe that I've had demons attacking my mind and soul continually.
I really believe we have to take that trifector of turning away from sin, agape loving our family in Christ and practicing righteousness stuff seriously.
I'm at my limits, man.
I'm taking it very seriously, man.
I will with all my heart to be holy and to walk with obedience to the Lord Jesus, and this stuff is just attacking me.

I have noticed in dgroup specifically while we have some good wholesome discussions, a lot of the time there's just whole lot of not
taking sexual purity seriously.
I feel like I'm dying from sin, man. It's deadly serious stuff.
I'll continue praying for you guys in the dgroup. Please pray for me too man.

Yes. And actually, in the greek it speaks in the past tense, that "having already denied ungodliness and worldy lusts" we should then proceed to godly lives. It is in line with Peter when he spoke about those "having escaped the corruption in the world through lust" were again entangled therein the latter end of them being worse than the first. To understand this and to be living this way is a sure sign of your salvation over which you must watch carefully lest you be led away by the error of the wicked and fall from your own sreadfastness.

   Also, the summary of facts was conveniently changed when I made new appearances in court, and the judge spun huge amounts of slander against me in court, the slander then became international news. He'll have to answer to God for that. The whole thing was antichrist, so I simply made testimony of Jesus in court. There are other reasons a person pleads guilty, and one is that the person is abiding by Christ's law to do no harm against their neighbour, and another reason is to not put Christ to the test by claiming perfect innocence. I was born-again of Jesus' spirit in 2 April 2022, and subsequently charged with a conviction after making a marriage proposal, so the conviction now makes it now more difficult to love my neighbour because it's more difficult for me to provide financial assistance for my neighbour if it is more difficult to have a job thanks to having a conviction. Satan would happily like it if servants of Jesus are deprived of financial income and given a bad public image because then they're less able to help their neighbour or support themself and their family:
  
      Jehovah God please grant us deliverance from this spirit of antichrist in Jesus Christ's name I ask.
  
      I Corinthians 13:1-8 - If I speak in the tongues of men and of angels, but have not love, I am a noisy gong or a clanging cymbal. And if I have prophetic powers, and understand all mysteries and all knowledge, and if I have all faith, so as to remove mountains, but have not love, I am nothing. If I give away all I have, and if I deliver up my body to be burned, but have not love, I gain nothing. Love is patient and kind; love does not envy or boast; it is not arrogant or rude. It does not insist on its own way; it is not irritable or resentful; it does not rejoice at wrongdoing, but rejoices with the truth. Love bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things. Love never ends. As for prophecies, they will pass away; as for tongues, they will cease; as for knowledge, it will pass away. (ESV)
  
  Love doesn't take into account wrongs suffered. I believe the NASB is more accurate on this than the NIV. Even if the NIV is right, I can't identify any specific thing the other side of court did wrong to me wrong prior to going to court. However, during and after my interactions with police and court it's different story. There was a relentlessly slandering, antichrist graceless spirit coming out from the other side. If I could identify the specific wrongs or the root causes I wouldn't impute them to them anyway because I forgave them. But there are some very suspect things which happened around around the time I got born-again. The entire thing surrounding getting pulled into court felt out of control, and influenced externally by antichrist spirits. I feel as if witchcraft was performed against me, with the demons harassing me and manifesting through people around me. I feel wronged and my complaint sits in God's courts. Until I am delivered, my complaint remains in God's courts. In summary, it feels like God made me born-again into LGBT GPT Neuralink demons-everywhere world. I proposed to the love of my life and God allowed all the demons attack me unceasingly for 2 years, not only destroying that but allowing the demons to cause corruption and defilement in my body which is the temple of the Holy Spirit and I expect God to rectify this somehow because an injustice has happened:

Anyone who does not love does not know God, because God is love. In this the love of God was made manifest among us, that God sent his only Son into the world, so that we might live through him. In this is love, not that we have loved God but that he loved us and sent his Son to be the propitiation for our sins. Beloved, if God so loved us, we also ought to love one another.

** endless sky ideas - it would be cool to make it a bit more RPG-like
- being not allowed to land in a system based on where you've been noticed to have been recently
  - 
- chance of escort ships "running away".
  - Then chase them down.
- other NPC characters managing fleets and doing trade runs, transporting passengers, etc.
- recruiting personnel from captured vessels
- temporary personnel during missions
- more missions with temporary escorts
- temporary artifacts which change your stats
  - reputation, or her stats
- more to do when landed on planets
  - waiting out battles, for example
- more to do without landing on planets
  - possible to do things like refuel in space
- battles where, say, only one or a set of ships needs to be destroyed but hides within an armada
- more commodities or outfits which can only be gained through battle - not in outfitters or shipyards
- make the universe less accessible
- non-universal currency
  - pirates, say, might trade in goods
  - different civs, different currencies
    - need to trade to get the currency you need
- make the universe feel more vast
  - longer interplanetary distances within a system
    - more things can take place from one planet to another, say
      - for example, on the way from earth to mars, could get attacked by rebels/pirates
- more ship upkeep
  - they could wear out or need repairs which must be done on the planet
    - parts/outfits wearing out from use
    - different parts could be more reliable over time
- inter-planetary highways
  - which would look cool - cargo or ships moving across space slowly in a line
    - generally well defended and safe
    - raidable
- bigger, slower interplanetary transport ships
- but crewmembers could be getting lasting experience too as time goes by, as parts wear out
- insurance for fleets
  - if you have insurance on an escort ship and lose it then can get part of the money back
- hyperspacing/jumping/slipping from system to system should not always be possible, or should be considered dangerous
  - entering into a system should feel strategic - select an angle, for example
  - different or better hyperspace drives should be able to take you closer or further to the system center or let you specify where in the system you want to enter by
- better planetary defenses
  - close to a planet, there should be defenses to prevent enemies from getting near
    - one such system defense could be simply policing ships which enter the system too close to the planet
      - it could be that a ship needs to be scanned first before getting close to the planet
        - there should be standard processes for entering into a system, docking, and leaving, etc.
- regular jobs
  - paid a good salary, but *must* get the job done or face consequences
  - standard protocols / rituals / things you have to shake-hands with / pass through to complete a routine transport job, for example
    - there should be incentive for taking on simple jobs for equipment transport that have this overhead of needing to follow the protocols
      - more money, or better job status, etc.
- better system defenses
  - getting to earth as an alien civ should appear very difficult
    - outer systems should be more accessible, but getting closer to earth, say, 
- obstacles within a system
  - like forcefields or long range stationary weapons, like planetary railguns
- friendly fire should be a thing
  - there should be a chance at hitting allied ships
  - upgrades or experienced crewmembers could decrease the likelihood of this
- crew experience should definitely be a thing
  - official faction navies should be fearsome also because of crew experience
- planet-specific outfits and ships
  - ships of the same model bought from a different planet inherit slightly different stats
    - if bought new, that is
  - also, should be able to buy a ship and pick it up from the shipyard on another planet
  - also, should be able to have a custom ship built with specific stats
    - this should take longer than the time to travel to the system - should need to wait for transmission to the system and then for it to be built
- autopilot for your own vessel
  - put the vessel on a mode:
    - collect asteroids
    - defensively patrol between two locations/waypoints within the system
    - board and take over vessels
    - board and collect resources
    - attack a certain faction or ship with a specific name

*** Analogy

Let's say there is an 800m sprint that everyone has to be able to make within the "Beginner time" and call themselves "fit" in order to be able to be able to take a trip to the international space station. Likewise, children of God need to be the good soil:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE

Most people might just assume they can do it within "Beginner time" and so don't make an attempt at training for test of fitness required to go to space. To not make any attempt at obeying Jesus' commandments by faith would be like the second son who did not go out to the vineyard:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *[[https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2021%3A28-31&version=ESV][Matthew 21:28-31]]* - What do you think? A man had two sons. And he went to the first and said, Son, go and work in the vineyard today. And he answered, I will not, but afterward he changed his mind and went. And he went to the other son and said the same. And he answered, I go, sir, but did not go. Which of the two did the will of his father? They said, The first. Jesus said to them, Truly, I say to you, the tax collectors and the prostitutes go into the kingdom of God before you. (ESV)
#+END_QUOTE

Now let's say there is someone now ranting and raving about some cataclysmic event on the horizon threatening the earth but only those who can make "Beginner time" for their age bracket are allowed to depart on a rocket - now the situation becomes more serious. As children of God, we know we need to by faith obey Jesus, turning away from sin and loving our family in Christ, etc. and practice righteousness:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *[[https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts%2017%3A30-31&version=ESV][Acts 17:30-31]]* - The times of ignorance God overlooked, but now he commands all people everywhere to repent, because he has fixed a day on which he will judge the world in righteousness by a man whom he has appointed; and of this he has given assurance to all by raising him from the dead. (ESV)
#+END_QUOTE

If we start claiming that we are  ourselves "fit", saying we can make "Beginner time", and we actually are not fit enough then people might start pointing that out saying, "You're not fit enough, etc. Do some working out at the gym to get fitter. Likewise, if we start calling ourselves children of God, then God will chastise us to get us into shape:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *[[https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Peter%201%3A14-19&version=ESV][I Peter 1:14-19]]* - As obedient children, do not be conformed to the passions of your former ignorance, but as he who called you is holy, you also be holy in all your conduct, since it is written, You shall be holy, for I am holy. And *if you call on him as Father who judges impartially according to each one's deeds*, conduct yourselves with fear throughout the time of your exile, knowing that you were ransomed from the futile ways inherited from your forefathers, not with perishable things such as silver or gold, but with the precious blood of Christ, like that of a lamb without blemish or spot.

The reason the Son of God appeared was to destroy the works of the devil. No one born of God makes a practice of sinning, for God's seed abides in him, and he cannot keep on sinning because he has been born of God. By this it is evident who are the children of God, and who are the children of the devil: whoever does not practice righteousness is not of God, nor is the one who does not love his brother. (ESV)

And while they were going to buy, the bridegroom came, and those who were ready went in with him to the marriage feast, and the door was shut.

Then you ought to have invested my money with the bankers, and at my coming I should have received what was my own with interest. So take the talent from him and give it to him who has the ten talents. For to everyone who has will more be given, and he will have an abundance.

And Father God is the one to do the grafting in and out. We should be wary about the verses which describe "why" He does it. But it doesn't mean He will. He's both just and the justifier of the one who has faith in Christ Jesus. And God is the vinedresser. We should still seek to believe, trust, obey Jesus - keep the commandments we've been commanded, and let God be the vinedresser.

Rather, speaking the truth in love, we are to grow up in every way into him who is the head, into Christ, from whom the whole body, joined and held together by every joint with which it is equipped, when each part is working properly, makes the body grow so that it builds itself up in love.

As the branch cannot bear fruit by itself, unless it abides in the vine, neither can you, unless you abide in me. I am the vine; you are the branches. Whoever abides in me and I in him, he it is that bears much fruit, for apart from me you can do nothing.

   I agree with @CatholicTruthOfficial here:
  
  youtube.com: Catholics Serving Jesus without Jesus {@CatholicTruthOfficial}
      We first need to have a relationship with Christ and it changes us from the inside out. From there we know who we are, we know our identity, we know what he wants, we know our calling, and then we go out and serve in the way that he wants us to, not the other way around. We don't just start serving. Many people serve but they don't have a relationship with Christ. How can you serve Christ if you don't have a relationship with him? So the relationship comes first then the identity and who we are and then serving him in love.

- Fleet option:
  - Shoot to disable
- More of a 'Darkwood'-like skirmish for ship capture dialog
- More things done within individual systems
- Buy hints / info to find the location of "hunt down" missions
  - Perhaps ask ships within a system for clues
    - Include the possiblity they ask "I'll give you the information not for money but for some specific cargo item/s"
- Ask escort for a full refuel
  - The "Ask for help" dialog should have more options
    - Trade crew, for example, fill tank
    - More extensive-intership actions, etc.
      - MAYBE Instead of drones, do manual repair in space, sped up with a crew member with higher engineering skill
      - Trade cargo between ships
        - Could trade in space for clandestine missions
- Option to get the escorts to keep each other topped up with fuel, including servicing your own ship
- Remove basic features such as autopilot for basic ships
  - These should be outfits or features of the ship
- Friendly fire by default
- Map legend
  - When viewing the map, make sure there is always a legend for the system circle colours to show what that colour is currently indicating
    - When viewing Missions, this isn't currently shown
  - ALREADY EXISTS When viewing the map, make sure there is always a legend for mission pin colour on the system circles
  - There should be a legend that explains both
- There should be a map display which shows different colours for different factions - So another tab for Map, like the existing ones "Shipyard", "Outfitters", "Missions", "Ports", "Stars"
  - So it's possible to get a glance at where factions are
    - Click on one system and it should show all of that current faction in blue
      - And then the inter-faction diplomatic status such as red for enemy should colour other factions, perhaps
      - Select: Use diplomatic colours vs use faction colours to color the circles
- Factions could have missions that have far more extensive consequences for the galaxy
- Do missions to gain support of other fleets
  - So can ask them for help, call in a favour, and ask them to fight for you in another mission, for example
- Make it so simply having overtly large amounts of money is a cause to be attacked by pirates
- Make an entire class of items which are very difficult to put a value on
  - They are valuable to the player because of their unique abilities, rather than containing much intrinsic value
- Take a page from EV's sister video-game "Missions of the Reliant", or from FTL
  - Crew members could have stats, and positions within the ship
    - Then could build up crews for your ships
  - Crew members could be injured or killed or taken hostage or themselves get XP, training, certificates,  etc.
  - Crew members could be reallocated to different parts of the ship

- NPCs could blow up derelict ships
- A log of the last systems passed through
  - Perhaps something simple:
    - Just a text log of systems passed through by p1 and when
      - I could also make it per-ship
  - Or perhaps more advanced:
    - Should be able to see all the hyperspace jumps made on the map, and go back in time
- Missions completion status
  - And how to search them out
- Have parts manufactured
  - Return to pick them up
  - This should cost less than buying them new, and is an option if the part is not available
- Let ship go (disown it)
- View other ships in your fleet from their perspective
  - Far more fleet management stuff
- Intel on where in the next system the enemy may be amassed - use some kind of detector/scanner?
  - Then strategically choose a part of the system to enter at
- Board an escort (to give it crew members, or to get crew members from it)
- Improve 'F' to filter search or have glob
- Self-scan ship outfits for things like Quarg equipment
  - Give a tabular overview or a report of if you're carrying anything illegal
  - It should be a fairly manual process because the person isn't having it checked elsewhere (but not too tedious)
- Hiring mercenaries
  - It's a good idea for when you need extra manpower going into a risky mission where ships will probably die but don't want to buy all the ships
- Turning on and off outfits/equipment while in flight for various reasons
  - Disabling equipment such as "slip drive" while in the ship
    - So that it uses the hyperdrive, say.
- Relative size view in buying a ship - in the corner, display the flat ship sprite at a size relative to the other ships visible
  - And perhaps then also show the magnification as a number
  - The biggest ship in the shipyard should have its scale set as 1 and take up the entire square
- Healing beam
  - alien
- Repair drone
  - earth tech
- Delivery ship/fleet - to deliver ammunition to your fleet.
  - Send it out to travel across the galaxy to buy stuff
    - Sometimes it doesn't return
- As you continue to attack a system, incoming ships will get defensive with a cooldown to get less defensive
  - It will get into higher alert (like defcon, or just a system defense/security level)
  - Services may shut down or get more exclusive
  - Defense fleets get stronger or planetary defenses increase
- Ship-to-ship power-sharing
  - Perhaps using lasers?
  - Seems like a very advanced tech
- KBShortcuts for:
  - Deselect jump
  - Also: Select landing destination (without landing)
    - Simply need more options for selecting ships and targets and managing fleets
- The map should show which port is selected - it should light up

*** Gameplay
- It should be much more difficult to get new ships, etc.
  - Purchasing and obtaining the items that one wants should be more difficult.
- Space battles should have more strategy
  - Slowing things down a little bit might help
  - Having a crew might help
    - Take a page from MOTR or from FTL
- Dominated planets should be able to have an insurrection and take back the planet.
  - Should have to keep the planets under check - revisit them with a significant fleet.
    - Or eventually, the planet be lost.

*** Modding
- If I myself got into modding endlesssky, it could be fun.
  - It doesn't really run as a simulation, which is a bit sad, or too procedurally-generated, really.
  - Pen.el is my project, but if I was familiar with endlesssky's codebase, I would be chipping away at it probably.

*** Improve game storyline
- long-term objectives for the entire galaxy
  - Like the game "dwarf fortress", it would be nice if it

*** Bug fixes
- Ensure when buying ships (e.g. drones) in sets of n (e.g 5), when naming the ships, it should take into consideration other ship names when numbering
  - Fill the blanks in the number count, rather than simply number 1 to n.
  - For example, if I buy 5x drones and name them "Brick". Then if I buy another 5x drones and name them Brick, the count should go from 6 to 10 this time.
  - However, if there are missing drones, say "Brick 2" is missing, but you have a "Brick 3", but no "Brick 4", then when buying 5 more drones named "Brick", count up from 1,
    but skip every named brick that already exists and add 5 more drones named "Brick" but that might include "Brick 2" and "Brick 4", but not "Brick 3".

+ [[https://youtube.com/watch?v=06EfTrprsRk&t=568][youtube.com: How Penal Substitution Is a Distortion of The Gospel {@TheTransfiguredLife} @time: 9 min 28 sec]] :: In orthodoxy,
    God punishing us isn't our greatest
    enemy. In orthodoxy we have many enemies
    to be saved from.
    The evil one and his minions, sin and
    death. Christ saves us from all of it.
    How we choose to respond to that love is
    entirely up to us. St. Anthony the Great
    indirectly dismantles penal
    substitutionary atonement. He says, quote
    "It is not right to imagine that God
    feels pleasure or displeasure in a human
    way. He is good and He only bestows
    blessings and never does harm, remaining
    always the same."
    
    We men, on the other
    hand, if we remain good through
    resembling God, are united to Him; but if
    we become evil and do not resemble God,
    we are separated from Him. By living in
    holiness we cleave to God, but by
    becoming wicked, we make him our enemy.
    It's not that He grows angry with us
    in an arbitrary way, but it is our own sins
    that prevent God from shining within
    us and expose us to demons who punish us.
    And if, through prayer and acts of compassion,
    we gain release from our sins, this does not
    mean that we have God over and made Him change,
    but that through our actions and turning to God,
    we have cured our wickedness and so once more
    enjoyment of God's goodness.
    Thus, to say that God turns away from the wicked
    is like saying that the sun hides itself
    from the blind.
    - St Anthony the Great (4th Century).

This is pretty cool @ShamounianExplains. I've been watching your videos recently, and they have been very helpful in sharpening my theology.

Would you mind if I share my testimony of being born-again of the Spirit. I though I would because you mentioned the new creation moment at the time of baptism, which is the only thing in this video I do not agree is strictly always the case.

My experience particularly after being born-again of the spirit certainly felt like being baptised into Jesus' death. All things have become new now. I wanted to share this part of my testimony with you because it shows that while a person is sealed with the Holy Spirit when they first trust in Christ, they may be born-of the Spirit (whatever happened to me) when God does it. And that makes sense because Jesus says:

    John 3:8 - The wind blows where it wishes, and you hear its sound, but you do not know where it comes from or where it goes. So it is with everyone who is born of the Spirit. (ESV)

I was baptised in 2005 (pretty confident it was, it may have been 2004) into the names Father, Son and Holy Spirit in Vanuatu by some nice people at a little church called Family Worship Center in Port Vila. But I began really seeking the Lord Jesus in 2021, and sought to repent from sin, and keep the 10 commandments from the heart because I lost confidence in my work and in the world and wanted to seek God authentically to give God a go. I'd seen too much hypocrisy with regards to people not loving one another or speaking the truth and being so disillusioned with all the hypocrisy, I earnestly endeavoured to seek God by trying to keep His commandments. I think God was putting faith in my heart and opening my eyes. Really, I was just trying to have real faith in God and be serious about His word and obey Him etc. This is totally in line with what Stephen says in Acts 7:51 - we have to not be resistant in our heart to God:

Acts 7:51 - You stiff-necked people, uncircumcised in heart and ears, you always resist the Holy Spirit. As your fathers did, so do you. (ESV)

Acts 5:32 - And we are witnesses to these things, and so is the Holy Spirit, whom God has given to those who obey him. (ESV)

I was born-again of the Spirit on the first day of Nisan on 2 April 2022. During the day in the afternoon I took a nap on my bed and woke up to observing my regenerated spirit man. It looked like a body made of blue light/electricity/fire with a dark bit around the bottom right of my rib cage. I'm unsure if that relates to Adam's rib taken or to the spear in Jesus' side. Anyway, in this state I called out to Jesus to save me because I didn't know what was going on, then I returned to observing the world through my physical body. To this day, I feel this spirit/fire/light energising my body/soul, so it's like being born-again with a second body literally.

It feels like the whole universe reproduced like a meiosis, and the Bible has really come alive etc. God put the fear of Him in me so I would not turn from Him.

Interestingly, the 2 April also line up very closely with Ramadan but not quite. Ramadan started in the evening of 1 April 2022, but it was actually the first day of Nisan, which was a Saturday (Shabbat) that I was born-again:

In 2022 Passover, Ramadan, and Easter all fall in April, a coincidence that happens only about every 33 years. The JW believe that Jesus died on 1 April. And I've seen other people's estimations that the date was 3 April.
2 April was also daylight savings. It's a big mystery to me.

A bunch of other stuff happened that year, and the year that followed. I made a marriage proposal on the after feast day of the transfiguration, for example.

1 Nisan Lunar new year, marking the month of Aviv meaning spring, as the first month of the year, which month was later called Nisan.

The first national mitzvah that was given to the Jewish people to fix the calendar to the
new moon of Aviv, according to the Book of Exodus 12:1-2, 12:18. (c. 1456 BCE).

So I was born-again of the Spirit on 1 Nisan, which commemorates the death of Abraham and the day the floodwaters receded from the earth:

1: 1 Nisan The day the floodwaters receded from the earth, after the dove was sent out by Noah and returned with an olive branch, according to Genesis 8:10-13
2: 1 Nisan (c. 1638 BCE) – Death of Abraham according to the Talmud[2]
3: 1 Nisan (c. 1533 BCE) – Death of Isaac according to the Talmud[2]
4: 1 Nisan (c. 1506 BCE) – Death of Jacob according to the Talmud[2]
5: 1 Nisan (c. 1455 BCE) – Tabernacle (Mishkan) inaugurated on the second year "Exodus 40".
6: 1 Nisan (c. 1455 BCE) death of Nadab and Abihu[3]
7: 1 Nisan (c. 3761 BCE) – Creation of the Universe according to Joshua ben Hananiah's opinion in the Talmud, tractate Rosh Hashanah 10b–11a).
8: 1 Nisan (1772) – Birth of Rabbi Nachman of Breslov[citation needed]
9: 1 Nisan (1892) – Death of Rabbi Elimelech Szapira of Grodzhisk

    Exodus 12:1-2 - The LORD said to Moses and Aaron in the land of Egypt, This month shall be for you the beginning of months. It shall be the first month of the year for you. (ESV)

    I Peter 3:21 - Baptism, which corresponds to this, now saves you, not as a removal of dirt from the body but as an appeal to God for a good conscience, through the resurrection of Jesus Christ, (ESV)

    In Colossians 2:16-17 Paul says that these feasts are a mere shadow of what is to come but the substance belongs to Christ. Paul is making the point that these biblical feasts are directly linked to the Messiah and to me that makes them worth studying, even though we're not under the law today (rather, we by faith trust and obey Christ). The feast can be grouped into two categories, the spring holy days and the Autumn holy days. The spring feasts include Passover, Unleavened bread, First fruits and Pentecost.

    The Autumn feasts include the Feast of trumpets the day of atonement and Tabernacles. You may have heard these feasts called by other names, which we'll mention later on. What did these feasts foreshadow? Well this is where things get interesting. The four spring feasts were all specifically fulfilled in the crucifixion, resurrection and the outpouring of the Holy Spirit that we read about in the Gospels in the Book of Acts. But it wasn't enough for God to merely fulfill the prophetic meaning of each feast, He orchestrated events so that each one was fulfilled on the exact day of the feast.

    Colossians 2:16-17 - Therefore let no one pass judgment on you in questions of food and drink, or with regard to a festival or a new moon or a Sabbath. These are a shadow of the things to come, but the substance belongs to Christ. (ESV)

Remember commendation comes from God. So if someone says such and such then it requires God's approval.
Who is to say God can't justify by faith alone? Is JP's teaching here useful?
[[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_6O9VUyowM&t=368s][I think JP is OK here]] to state a position on how faith in Jesus, being justified and placed into Christ and sanctified while obeying the truth for a sincere brotherly love, working by love gets a person to heaven. He's simply helping others by stating his understanding/this position (at the time he said it) of the process of salvation and getting to heaven. It's not up to us to say that Jesus can't save someone by faith alone - I think He could. But it's accurate to use other parts of scripture to talk about how to "get to know God, be brought to God, 'get to heaven' ", as JP has done here. If we get to heaven with love for Jesus then I think that qualifies us to "get into heaven". Repenting, turning away from sin is an act of love to God I'm sure as it's obedient to Jesus.

+ [[https://www.earlychristianwritings.com/text/1clement-lightfoot.html][1Clem 50:1-4]] :: Ye see, dearly beloved, how great and marvelous a thing is love, and there is no declaring its perfection. Who is sufficient to be found therein, save those to whom God shall vouchsafe it? Let us therefore entreat and ask of His mercy, that we may be found blameless in love, standing apart from the factiousness of men. All the generations from Adam unto this day have passed away: but they that by God's grace were perfected in love dwell in the abode of the pious; and they shall be made manifest in the visitation of the Kingdom of God. For it is written; Enter into the closet for a very little while until Mine anger and Mine wrath shall pass away, and I will remember a good day and will raise you from your tombs. Blessed were we, dearly beloved, if we should be doing the commandments of God in concord of love, to the end that our sins may through love be forgiven us.

Matthew 19:17 And he said to him, Why do you ask me about what is good? There is only one who is good. If you would enter life, keep the commandments.

    John 14:15-21 - If you love me, you will keep my commandments. And I will ask the Father, and he will give you another Helper, to be with you forever, even the Spirit of truth, whom the world cannot receive, because it neither sees him nor knows him. You know him, for he dwells with you and will be in you. I will not leave you as orphans; I will come to you. Yet a little while and the world will see me no more, but you will see me. Because I live, you also will live. In that day you will know that I am in my Father, and you in me, and I in you. Whoever has my commandments and keeps them, he it is who loves me. And he who loves me will be loved by my Father, and I will love him and manifest myself to him. (ESV)

Believing in your heart is an initial act of obedience to Christ's Law before continuing in the teaching of Christ. If we believe in Him we have obeyed Him, but belief doesn't end there:

    John 14:1 - “Do not let your heart be troubled; believe (G4100 pisteuo) in God, believe (G4100 pisteuo) also in Me. (NASB)

    John 8:23-24 - He said to them, You are from below; I am from above. You are of this world; I am not of this world. I told you that you would die in your sins, for unless you believe that I am he you will die in your sins. (ESV) 

    I Corinthians 8:3 - But if anyone loves God, he is known by God. (ESV)

    I John 4:8-10 - Anyone who does not love does not know God, because God is love. In this the love of God was made manifest among us, that God sent his only Son into the world, so that we might live through him. In this is love, not that we have loved God but that he loved us and sent his Son to be the propitiation for our sins. (ESV)

    I John 2:3-4 - And by this we know that we have come to know him, if we keep his commandments. Whoever says I know him but does not keep his commandments is a liar, and the truth is not in him, (ESV)

    I John 3:23-24 - And this is his commandment, that we believe in the name of his Son Jesus Christ and love one another, just as he has commanded us. Whoever keeps his commandments abides in him, and he in them. And by this we know that he abides in us, by the Spirit whom he has given us. (ESV)

    I Peter 1:22-25 - Having purified your souls by your obedience to the truth for a sincere brotherly love, love one another earnestly from a pure heart, since you have been born again, not of perishable seed but of imperishable, through the living and abiding word of God; for All flesh is like grass and all its glory like the flower of grass. The grass withers, and the flower falls, but the word of the Lord remains forever. And this word is the good news that was preached to you. (ESV)

    Psalms 34:22 - The LORD redeems the life of his servants; none of those who take refuge in him will be condemned. (ESV)

Jesus is preparing us to be able to stand before Father God blamelessly:

    I Thessalonians 3:11-13 - Now may our God and Father himself, and our Lord Jesus, direct our way to you, and may the Lord make you increase and abound in love for one another and for all, as we do for you, so that he may establish your hearts blameless in holiness before our God and Father, at the coming of our Lord Jesus with all his saints. (ESV)

Because God loved us first:

    The Apostle Paul endeavours to know Jesus ('makes it his own'. See Php 3:9-13) because Jesus made Paul His own
        To be found in Jesus is what Paul describes as the righteousness from God that depends on faith
        We know Jesus by believing in Him and obeying His commandments, and when we love and forgive we know God loved us and forgave us first
    We must love because He loved us first
        Romans 5:7-8 - For one will scarcely die for a righteous person—though perhaps for a good person one would dare even to die— but God shows his love for us in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us. (ESV)
    We must forgive as we have been forgiven
        Colossians 3:12-14 - Put on then, as God's chosen ones, holy and beloved, compassion, kindness, humility, meekness, and patience, bearing with one another and, if one has a complaint against another, forgiving each other; as the Lord has forgiven you, so you also must forgive. And above all these put on love, which binds everything together in perfect harmony. (ESV)
    We must be conformed to holiness
        I Peter 1:14-16 - As obedient children, do not be conformed to the passions of your former ignorance, but as he who called you is holy, you also be holy in all your conduct, since it is written, You shall be holy, for I am holy. (ESV)

Children of God:

    Do not make a practice of sinning
    Love their family in Christ
    Practices righteousness

    I John 3:8-10 - Whoever makes a practice of sinning is of the devil, for the devil has been sinning from the beginning. The reason the Son of God appeared was to destroy the works of the devil. No one born of God makes a practice of sinning, for God's seed abides in him, and he cannot keep on sinning because he has been born of God. By this it is evident who are the children of God, and who are the children of the devil: whoever does not practice righteousness is not of God, nor is the one who does not love his brother. (ESV)

Believing in Jesus Christ, we have the right to become children of God. We are given the right to be sanctified, delivered from sin, to be able to love our family in Christ and practice righteousness:

    John 1:12-13 - But to all who did receive him, who believed in his name, he gave the right to become children of God, who were born, not of blood nor of the will of the flesh nor of the will of man, but of God. (ESV)

This right is not for everyone, but only for those who receive Jesus Christ, who God has given Jesus Christ:

    John 17:9 - I am praying for them. I am not praying for the world but for those whom you have given me, for they are yours. (ESV)

    John 17:8 - For I have given them the words that you gave me, and they have received them and have come to know in truth that I came from you; and they have believed that you sent me. (ESV)

    John 17:17 - Sanctify them in the truth; your word is truth. (ESV)

We're saved from sin by being placed "in Christ" (justified by Jesus' blood while in Christ) and "brought to God" (sanctified):

    Romans 5:9-11 - Since, therefore, we have now been justified by his blood, much more shall we be saved by him from the wrath of God. For if while we were enemies we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son, much more, now that we are reconciled, shall we be saved by his life. More than that, we also rejoice in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom we have now received reconciliation. (ESV)

It's all about the love of God and abiding in the love of God, obeying His commandments, particularly Jesus' commandments:

    *Luke 7:47* - Therefore I tell you, her sins, which are many, are forgiven—for she loved much. But he who is forgiven little, loves little. (ESV)

    We have to pray and ask the Lord to
    visit each one with repentance so that
    they can be saved. Remember, St. Paul was a
    blasphemer and look what the mercy of
    the Lord did for him, making him our
    champion. What I would really hope, what I
    want, I told my parishioners this
    yesterday, I want to catechize and

    concocting this evil scheme and foisting
    it upon the world. I want to
    catechize and baptize them all. I want to
    be able to wash this heinous sin away

Jesus' sacrifice outside Jerusalem is so that we might be sanctified through His own blood and come into Jerusalem.

He will wipe away every tear from their eyes, and death shall be no more, neither shall there be mourning nor crying nor pain anymore, for the former things have passed away. And he who was seated on the throne said, Behold, I am making all things new. Also he said, Write this down, for these words are trustworthy and true. And he said to me, It is done!

    refers to immorality, impurity, passion,
    evil desire, greed and then he says, "On

    will come."

    So we may not say the cross really did
    atone for 'every sin /except/ the sin of
    rejecting Jesus' - that's not
    true. People who reject Jesus really will
    be punished for their sins. The books
    will be opened according to
    Revelation and all the deeds will be
    read out and the sentence of
    condemnation will be just because those
    sins will come upon their own head and
    be their just condemnation. They were not
    covered by the blood of Jesus.

I know I have felt tested on giving up idols and it has felt like the end of an age, and we're to remain faithful to Jesus so not join ourselves to people following false-gods.

*** edit - add the verse
We need the Spirit of Christ to be in us. God gives the spirit to those who obey Him, obey Jesus.

    Acts 5:29-32 - But Peter and the apostles answered, We must obey God rather than men. The God of our fathers raised Jesus, whom you killed by hanging him on a tree. God exalted him at his right hand as Leader and Savior, to give repentance to Israel and forgiveness of sins. And we are witnesses to these things, and so is the Holy Spirit, whom God has given to those who obey him. (ESV) 

*** Add
Believing in Jesus Christ, we have the right to become children of God. We are given the right to be sanctified, delivered from sin, to be able to love our family in Christ and practice righteousness:

    John 1:12-13 - But to all who did receive him, who believed in his name, he gave the right to become children of God, who were born, not of blood nor of the will of the flesh nor of the will of man, but of God. (ESV)

This right is not for everyone, but only for those who receive Jesus Christ, who God has given Jesus Christ:

    John 17:9 - I am praying for them. I am not praying for the world but for those whom you have given me, for they are yours. (ESV)

    John 17:8 - For I have given them the words that you gave me, and they have received them and have come to know in truth that I came from you; and they have believed that you sent me. (ESV)

    John 17:17 - Sanctify them in the truth; your word is truth. (ESV)

We believing on Jesus' name, Jesus Christ Son of God, we have the right to become children of God, and also to love our family in Christ, and to be sanctified and to practice righteousness are also mandatory - both commandments and rights that we have. No-one is allowed to prevent you from obeying God, from obeying Jesus, and we must obey God, obey Jesus.

    Acts 5:29 - But Peter and the apostles answered, We must obey God rather than men. (ESV)

We need the Spirit of Christ to be in us. God gives the spirit to those who obey Him, obey Jesus.

    Acts 5:29-32 - But Peter and the apostles answered, We must obey God rather than men. The God of our fathers raised Jesus, whom you killed by hanging him on a tree. God exalted him at his right hand as Leader and Savior, to give repentance to Israel and forgiveness of sins. And we are witnesses to these things, and so is the Holy Spirit, whom God has given to those who obey him. (ESV) 

In fact, if we start calling on God as our Father, then we have an obligation to think and act like children of God, and God will chastise us and discipline us to clean us up, and Christ may/will judge us and discipline us that we may not be condemned along with the world:

    John 1:12 - But to all who did receive him, who believed in his name, he gave the right to become children of God, (ESV)

    Hebrews 12:4-8 - In your struggle against sin you have not yet resisted to the point of shedding your blood. And have you forgotten the exhortation that addresses you as sons? My son, do not regard lightly the discipline of the Lord, nor be weary when reproved by him. For the Lord disciplines the one he loves, and chastises every son whom he receives. It is for discipline that you have to endure. God is treating you as sons. For what son is there whom his father does not discipline? If you are left without discipline, in which all have participated, then you are illegitimate children and not sons. (ESV)

    I Corinthians 11:32 - But when we are judged by the Lord, we are disciplined so that we may not be condemned along with the world. (ESV)

*** edit
So by faith we believe we are children of God, and believing on the name of Jesus Christ, the Son of God, God gives us the right and the commandment to be sanctified in the Truth. An analogy I like is that that by believing on Jesus' name as Son of God and Christ, we are allowed to be placed into God's ambulance and brought to God. In other words, we continue in faith and obedience, as slaves of God to be cleaned up as we come to the knowledge of the Truth. God continues to heal, sanctify, deliver us and help us to grow in knowledge of Him, as we obey Him:

*** Which commandments must we keep
Which commandments must we keep? Jesus' commandments - Jesus' sayings and commandments which Father God commanded Him to speak. Also, it's worth learning from the Apostles who were with Jesus. Some commandments of Jesus are divulged and better understood from their writings.

*I John 3:21-24* - Beloved, if our heart does not condemn us, we have confidence before God; and whatever we ask we receive from him, because we keep his commandments and do what pleases him. And this is his commandment, that we believe in the name of his Son Jesus Christ and love one another, just as he has commanded us. Whoever keeps his commandments abides in him, and he in them. And by this we know that he abides in us, by the Spirit whom he has given us. (ESV)

Because God loved us first:

    The Apostle Paul endeavours to know Jesus ('makes it his own'. See Php 3:9-13 below) because Jesus made Paul His own
        To be found in Jesus is what Paul describes as the righteousness from God that depends on faith
        We know Jesus by believing in Him and obeying His commandments, and when we love and forgive we know God loved us and forgave us first
    We should love because He loved us first
        Romans 5:7-8 - For one will scarcely die for a righteous person—though perhaps for a good person one would dare even to die— but God shows his love for us in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us. (ESV)
    We must forgive as we have been forgiven
        Colossians 3:12-14 - Put on then, as God's chosen ones, holy and beloved, compassion, kindness, humility, meekness, and patience, bearing with one another and, if one has a complaint against another, forgiving each other; as the Lord has forgiven you, so you also must forgive. And above all these put on love, which binds everything together in perfect harmony. (ESV)
    We must be conformed to holiness
        I Peter 1:14-16 - As obedient children, do not be conformed to the passions of your former ignorance, but as he who called you is holy, you also be holy in all your conduct, since it is written, You shall be holy, for I am holy. (ESV)

Children of God:

    Do not make a practice of sinning
    Love their family in Christ
    Practices righteousness

    I John 3:8-10 - Whoever makes a practice of sinning is of the devil, for the devil has been sinning from the beginning. The reason the Son of God appeared was to destroy the works of the devil. No one born of God makes a practice of sinning, for God's seed abides in him, and he cannot keep on sinning because he has been born of God. By this it is evident who are the children of God, and who are the children of the devil: whoever does not practice righteousness is not of God, nor is the one who does not love his brother. (ESV)

Read I John 5 for assurance of salvation. The entire chapter is important.

People who keep Jesus' commandments are found in Christ who is in God.

*John 15:10* - If you keep my commandments, you will abide in my love, just as I have kept my Father's commandments and abide in his love. (ESV)

*Ephesians 5:1-5* - Therefore be imitators of God, as beloved children. And walk in love, as Christ loved us and gave himself up for us, a fragrant offering and sacrifice to God. But sexual immorality and all impurity or covetousness must not even be named among you, as is proper among saints. Let there be no filthiness nor foolish talk nor crude joking, which are out of place, but instead let there be thanksgiving. For you may be sure of this, that everyone who is sexually immoral or impure, or who is covetous (that is, an idolater), has no inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and God. (ESV)

If you love Jesus, keep His commandments. The one who keeps Jesus' commandments is the one who loves Jesus:

    John 14:15 - If you love me, you will keep my commandments. (ESV)

    John 14:21 - Whoever has my commandments and keeps them, he it is who loves me. And he who loves me will be loved by my Father, and I will love him and manifest myself to him. (ESV)

Jesus kept Father God's commandments including the commandment of what to say and speak to us. Jesus' words and sayings and commandments which God gave Him to speak to us are what we should keep.

*John 12:44-50* - And Jesus cried out and said, Whoever believes in me, believes not in me but in him who sent me. And whoever sees me sees him who sent me. I have come into the world as light, so that whoever believes in me may not remain in darkness. If anyone hears my words and does not keep them, I do not judge him; for I did not come to judge the world but to save the world. The one who rejects me and does not receive my words has a judge; the word that I have spoken will judge him on the last day. For I have not spoken on my own authority, but the Father who sent me has himself given me a commandment—what to say and what to speak. And I know that his commandment is eternal life. What I say, therefore, I say as the Father has told me. (ESV)

We *must* forgive. And we don't want the wrath of God, so we must put away what is earthly:

*Colossians 3:5-13* - Put to death therefore what is earthly in you: sexual immorality, impurity, passion, evil desire, and covetousness, which is idolatry. On account of these the wrath of God is coming. In these you too once walked, when you were living in them. But now you must put them all away: anger, wrath, malice, slander, and obscene talk from your mouth. Do not lie to one another, seeing that you have put off the old self with its practices and have put on the new self, which is being renewed in knowledge after the image of its creator. Here there is not Greek and Jew, circumcised and uncircumcised, barbarian, Scythian, slave, free; but Christ is all, and in all. Put on then, as God's chosen ones, holy and beloved, compassion, kindness, humility, meekness, and patience, bearing with one another and, if one has a complaint against another, forgiving each other; as the Lord has forgiven you, so you also must forgive. (ESV)

*Romans 2:2-11* - We know that the judgment of God rightly falls on those who do such things. Do you suppose, O man—you who judge those who do such things and yet do them yourself—that you will escape the judgment of God? Or do you presume on the riches of his kindness and forbearance and patience, not knowing that God's kindness is meant to lead you to repentance? But because of your hard and impenitent heart you are storing up wrath for yourself on the day of wrath when God's righteous judgment will be revealed. He will render to each one according to his works: to those who by patience in well-doing seek for glory and honor and immortality, he will give eternal life; but for those who are self-seeking and do not obey the truth, but obey unrighteousness, there will be wrath and fury. There will be tribulation and distress for every human being who does evil, the Jew first and also the Greek, but glory and honor and peace for everyone who does good, the Jew first and also the Greek. For God shows no partiality. (ESV)

Being a Christian means God helps us to put the sin to death. And us being commanded to not obey the body of sin, the flesh, what is earthly, etc. that absolutely is what we are supposed to do. That sinful stuff includes not loving our family in Christ.

    I Corinthians 11:32 - But when we are judged by the Lord, we are disciplined so that we may not be condemned along with the world. (ESV)

*I John 3:10-14* - By this it is evident who are the children of God, and who are the children of the devil: whoever does not practice righteousness is not of God, nor is the one who does not love his brother. For this is the message that you have heard from the beginning, that we should love one another. We should not be like Cain, who was of the evil one and murdered his brother. And why did he murder him? Because his own deeds were evil and his brother's righteous. Do not be surprised, brothers, that the world hates you. We know that we have passed out of death into life, because we love the brothers. Whoever does not love abides in death. (ESV)

Our salvation looks like being cleaned up by His spirit, behaving in a way now reflecting that we have knowledge of God (i.e. godliness), and not worldliness, treasuring God and one another in Christ who are following Jesus' commandments too, and letting go of treasuring/valuing worldly things, with hope for eternal life:

    Titus 2:11-13 - For the grace of God has appeared, bringing salvation for all people, training us to renounce ungodliness and worldly passions, and to live self-controlled, upright, and godly lives in the present age, waiting for our blessed hope, the appearing of the glory of our great God and Savior Jesus Christ, (ESV)

Q: Which commandments? A: Jesus' sayings and commandments which Father God commanded Him to speak. Also, it's worth learning from the Apostles who were with Jesus. Some commandments of Jesus are divulged and better understood from their writings.

**** Add this verse
*Philippians 3:9-13* - and be found in him, not having a righteousness of my own that comes from the law, but that which comes through faith in Christ, the righteousness from God that depends on faith— that I may know him and the power of his resurrection, and may share his sufferings, becoming like him in his death, that by any means possible I may attain the resurrection from the dead. Not that I have already obtained this or am already perfect, but I press on to make it my own, because Christ Jesus has made me his own. Brothers, I do not consider that I have made it my own. But one thing I do: forgetting what lies behind and straining forward to what lies ahead, (ESV)

*** 
The will of God must be discerned through testing with a renewed mind:

    Romans 12:2 - Do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewal of your mind, that by testing you may discern what is the will of God, what is good and acceptable and perfect. (ESV)

Jesus has to be your Lord in reality, doing Father God's will in serving Jesus to enter the Kingdom:

    Ephesians 6:6 - not by the way of eye-service, as people-pleasers, but as servants of Christ, doing the will of God from the heart, 

    Matthew 7:21 - Not everyone who says to me, Lord, Lord, will enter the kingdom of heaven, but the one who does the will of my Father who is in heaven. (ESV)

We must be doing the will of God to not be under the law:

    Psalms 143:10 - Teach me to do your will, for you are my God! Let your good Spirit lead me on level ground! (ESV)

    Galatians 5:18 - But if you are led by the Spirit, you are not under the law. (ESV)

Loving one another is the will of God:

    II Corinthians 8:3-5 - For they gave according to their means, as I can testify, and beyond their means, of their own free will, begging us earnestly for the favor of taking part in the relief of the saints— and this, not as we expected, but they gave themselves first to the Lord and then by the will of God to us. (ESV)

Controlling our own body in holiness and honor is the will of God:

    I Thessalonians 4:3-5 - For this is the will of God, your sanctification: that you abstain from sexual immorality; that each one of you know how to control his own body in holiness and honor, not in the passion of lust like the Gentiles who do not know God; (ESV)

The will of God is that we should not be materialistic or worldly. We must limit our agape love to God and to other people, especially our family in Christ and not agape love anything of the world. I think I John 2:15-17 is essentially saying, "Do not agape love the world or what's in the world. Do not love the things of this world with the type of love that we have for God and for people, namely agape love." If we fall out of agape love for the world and are not conformed to the world but are transformed by the renewing of our minds then by testing we will be able to discern the will of God:

    I John 2:15-17 - Do not love (agapate) the world or the things in the world. If anyone loves the world, the love of the Father is not in him. For all that is in the world—the desires of the flesh and the desires of the eyes and pride in possessions—is not from the Father but is from the world. And the world is passing away along with its desires, but whoever does the will of God abides forever. (ESV)

If we get conformed to the world then we won't be able to discern the will of God:

    Romans 12:1-2 - I appeal to you therefore, brothers, by the mercies of God, to present your bodies as a living sacrifice, holy and acceptable to God, which is your spiritual worship. Do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewal of your mind, that by testing you may discern what is the will of God, what is good and acceptable and perfect. (ESV)

After doing the will of God, and not shrinking back, we receive what is promised:

    Hebrews 10:36-38 - For you have need of endurance, so that when you have done the will of God you may receive what is promised. For, Yet a little while, and the coming one will come and will not delay; but my righteous one shall live by faith, and if he shrinks back, my soul has no pleasure in him. (ESV)

The will of God is that by doing good you should put to silence the ignorance of foolish people:

    I Peter 2:15 - For this is the will of God, that by doing good you should put to silence the ignorance of foolish people. (ESV)

    I John 2:17 - And the world is passing away along with its desires, but whoever does the will of God abides forever.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *I John 5:1-21* - Everyone who believes that Jesus is the Christ has been born of God, and everyone who loves the Father loves whoever has been born of him. By this we know that we love the children of God, when we love God and obey his commandments. For this is the love of God, that we keep his commandments. And his commandments are not burdensome. For everyone who has been born of God overcomes the world. And this is the victory that has overcome the world—our faith. Who is it that overcomes the world except the one who believes that Jesus is the Son of God? This is he who came by water and blood—Jesus Christ; not by the water only but by the water and the blood. And the Spirit is the one who testifies, because the Spirit is the truth. For there are three that testify: the Spirit and the water and the blood; and these three agree. If we receive the testimony of men, the testimony of God is greater, for this is the testimony of God that he has borne concerning his Son. Whoever believes in the Son of God has the testimony in himself. Whoever does not believe God has made him a liar, because he has not believed in the testimony that God has borne concerning his Son. And this is the testimony, that God gave us eternal life, and this life is in his Son. Whoever has the Son has life; whoever does not have the Son of God does not have life. *I write these things to you who believe in the name of the Son of God that you may know that you have eternal life*. And this is the confidence that we have toward him, that if we ask anything according to his will he hears us. And if we know that he hears us in whatever we ask, we know that we have the requests that we have asked of him. If anyone sees his brother committing a sin not leading to death, he shall ask, and God will give him life—to those who commit sins that do not lead to death. There is sin that leads to death; I do not say that one should pray for that. All wrongdoing is sin, but there is sin that does not lead to death. We know that everyone who has been born of God does not keep on sinning, but he who was born of God protects him, and the evil one does not touch him. We know that we are from God, and the whole world lies in the power of the evil one. And we know that the Son of God has come and has given us understanding, so that we may know him who is true; and we are in him who is true, in his Son Jesus Christ. He is the true God and eternal life. Little children, keep yourselves from idols. (ESV)

** TODO Put these verses together
 We are saved from the wrath of God by the life of Jesus Christ. I think that's in part saying that the life of Jesus helps us to stop practicing sinful things:

    Ephesians 5:5-7 - For you may be sure of this, that everyone who is sexually immoral or impure, or who is covetous (that is, an idolater), has no inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and God. Let no one deceive you with empty words, for because of these things the wrath of God comes upon the sons of disobedience. Therefore do not associate with them;

    Ephesians 2:3 - among whom we all once lived in the passions of our flesh, carrying out the desires of the body and the mind, and were by nature children of wrath, like the rest of mankind. (ESV)

That's confirmed here:

    I John 3:5-6 - You know that he appeared to take away sins, and in him there is no sin. No one who abides in him keeps on sinning; no one who keeps on sinning has either seen him or known him.

*** Put this there
 Repent, be sanctified, love God and your neighbour, believe and obey Jesus:

    Luke 10:25-28 - And behold, a lawyer stood up to put him to the test, saying, Teacher, what shall I do to inherit eternal life? He said to him, What is written in the Law? How do you read it? And he answered, You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your strength and with all your mind, and your neighbor as yourself. And he said to him, You have answered correctly; do this, and you will live. (ESV)

"work out your *own* salvation"

And then make a point that you should be focusing on your own relationship with Jesus.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *John 21:21-23* - When Peter saw him, he said to Jesus, Lord, what about this man? Jesus said to him, If it is my will that he remain until I come, what is that to you? You follow me! So the saying spread abroad among the brothers that this disciple was not to die; yet Jesus did not say to him that he was not to die, but, If it is my will that he remain until I come, what is that to you? (ESV)
#+END_QUOTE

** TODO Consider rewording this heading. Are we debtors? In a way.
*** We are debtors. We are debtors to God for His mercy on us so we should by His grace put to death the deeds of the body, the deeds of the flesh:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *Romans 8:12-15* - So then, brothers, we are debtors, not to the flesh, to live according to the flesh. For if you live according to the flesh you will die, but if by the Spirit you put to death the deeds of the body, you will live. For all who are led by the Spirit of God are sons of God. For you did not receive the spirit of slavery to fall back into fear, but you have received the Spirit of adoption as sons, by whom we cry, Abba! Father! (ESV)
#+END_QUOTE

*** 
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *Luke 7:41-43* - A certain moneylender had two debtors. One owed five hundred denarii, and the other fifty. When they could not pay, he cancelled the debt of both. Now which of them will love him more? Simon answered, The one, I suppose, for whom he cancelled the larger debt. And he said to him, You have judged rightly. (ESV)
#+END_QUOTE

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *Colossians 2:13-17* - And you, who were dead in your trespasses and the uncircumcision of your flesh, God made alive together with him, having forgiven us all our trespasses, by canceling the record of debt that stood against us with its legal demands. This he set aside, nailing it to the cross. He disarmed the rulers and authorities and put them to open shame, by triumphing over them in him. Therefore let no one pass judgment on you in questions of food and drink, or with regard to a festival or a new moon or a Sabbath. These are a shadow of the things to come, but the substance belongs to Christ. (ESV)
#+END_QUOTE

** TODO Consider adding
- Something about _the Word became flesh_

I could use an analogy, perhaps.

** But I should also add
- I would be extremely reluctant to condemn any category of believers

God's vision is greater than my own.

** TODO Consider letting the obedience girl know about believers and saints
- well... from the revelation verse, etc.

Baseline salvation, etc.

** TODO Fix this - to say a person receives the Holy Spirit when they believe - that's why I think that being born of the Spirit is probably different event
A person may not yet have received the Holy Spirit at the time they believed. I think it's certainly essential to have obedience to God in order to be born of the Spirit, as far as I can tell.

** TODO Add the song, "Jesus, Lover of my Soul"

** Buy eraser kit with cleaning rod
If you’re pencil doesn’t include a cleaning rod, you can buy an eraser kit that includes one. Just makes sure that the rod is the right size for your pencil — that is, not bigger than the diameter of your lead. Smaller, say 0.3 mm for a 0.5 mm pencil, is OK though!

* TODO Add a point
By grace you have been saved through faith and this is not of your own doing, it is the gift of God.

If someone was living in Egypt and was given daily food on the basis that they would bow to
an idol once every day, and then by faith they heeded God's call to leave Egypt and go
to a promised land of abundance without idolatry, and then in the wilderness
they began began getting very hungry and it looked like they might run out of food and die in the desert
but by faith they believed that God would supply their needs instead of pining over an idolatrous way of life,
then a 'good samaritan' bedouin brought them some food and they ate the food, then
the initial leaving of Egypt or the receiving of the food itself could both be described as that initial step of faith,
or the salvation having arrived but the "putting hand to the plough and not looking back" and the actual consumption of the food
could be described as the "working out of that salvation". And the 'process' of being saved is the salvation.

So if someone says that when they first believed in their heart the gospel they were saved based entirely on Jesus' finished works,
this is correct in a way, but Jesus has purchased the salvation which is a process.
If someone says that process was completed when they first believed, then what more is there to hope for?
What type of relationship is that where a person terminates their obedience after the first step of obedience?
They may as well say they have arrived in the promised land already.
They may as well say they have arrived in heaven already.
I just think they fullness of the gospel has a lot more too it.

  Why? because you haven't repented. You have

  something in order to repent you never
  repent because it doesn't depend on a
  feeling.

To be able to do stuff like life sciences.

I can make this, actually.
I should just set it up once.

** TODO Yeah, do this next
I should make Japanese-mode show the words.

* TODO Make a per-function abbrev org mode which, given a transformation function applies the function to every word written
It wouldn't use the actual abbrev-mode, I think, but I would have to connect the appropriate hooks myself.

* TODO I should set up a system for learning the JayCar inventory or something
Try to simply become good at it.

* TODO Make some flashcard tool or system for learning lists of things

If I think about it, it might be a lot better for me to have a simple
part-time job at a place like JayCar.

It's far less complicated, and I can do learning on the side.

Yeah, I'll apply for a JayCar job after doing some study.

But even a place like a sushi bar would be great.

I should learn to actually write Japanese well.
Maybe I could use Google Translate to test myself.

Also I should make something for emacs to automatically translate Romanji into Hiragana/Katakana.

https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/AbbrevMode

Automatically expand romanji.

** TODO Make an efficient text-rewriter for the terminal
It's job would be to do things like:
- translate Romanji into Japanese as I write it.

Every time I write a word, emacs should check to see if the word is in the 'snippet' database and replace it.

* TODO Make a Script that looks for all the 'Bold' Bible references in the org-mode document - ones which do not have a URL, and URLify it

* TODO Make a method of selecting visually from emacs, and ignoring hidden characters

* TODO Begin doing some kind of work that is useful for society, I guess
Hmm.
Being a servant of Christ, though, is serving others.
I just want any job so I can be radically generous.

* TODO Write about

  - I believe that Jesus still makes apostles

* TODO Improve Pen.el and document-making skills
- I should improve at parsing the org-mode document
- I should add annotations to parts of Bible verses through the main bible-mode

I guess I do need a database of some kind to store Bible-mode information.
Text files are great though.

* TODO Get some cordial and some juice and some fizzy

* TODO Work towards cross-references and inline annotations for my PDFs

* TODO Do a little more programming
- That would be fun

** Work towards
- More Pen.el Bible study software stuff
- Age of Empires trigger stuff

*** It's important to improve on

* I should definitely continue with my theology writeup
I should extend my annotating in the PDFs etc. to make hyperlinks over phrases in the text.

But intelligently.
I should be able to make the annotations inside of Bible-mode, and then the PDF should reflect those linkages.

It would be quite interesting to make a hyperlinked Bible with the top crossreferece.

* Maybe use this

* TODO I should get back up now
I don't want things to break too badly.
I don't want to be ultra influential.
I really do not want to be ultra influential.
I just want to not be attacked spiritually, and I'm actually literally waiting on God to be delivered from it entirely.
Fighting back against witchcraft/spiritual attack is not fun, and I don't want to have any online presence.
I'm just so tired of being attacked spiritually and I want to go home.
I want to be raptured.
I consider this world to be a corpse I want to leave behind.
If I have to stay here then I want to not be squeezed to death.
Please God help me.
I feel so squeezed.

* I hate being in this world
I really hate being here.

* TODO I should find myself a thing to do - some kind of interest
- Yeah, do some more chemistry, I guess. Just learn things one step at a time.
  - But in all honesty, where will that get me?
- My goal should really be to become like Jesus in His death, like [[bl:Phil 3]].
  - I guess this means moving on from Melee.
  - God, I just want some help.

* TODO Add the stuff about Philippians 3 to my bible study document

I would say that 'holy software' is software that facilitates a person's ability to have a pure devotion to Jesus rather than hindering that relationship.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *II Corinthians 11:3* - But I am afraid that as the serpent deceived Eve by his cunning, your thoughts will be led astray from a sincere and pure devotion to Christ. (ESV)
#+END_QUOTE

I feel strongly that obedience to Jesus' commandments is something that we don't want to disrupt. When you're following them in reality, there tends to be a bit of resistance to living that out faithfully from 'the world'.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *I Corinthians 10:23* - All things are lawful, but not all things are helpful. All things are lawful, but not all things build up. (ESV)
#+END_QUOTE

Generally, if something has been reserved / set apart for serving God then you could call it holy.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *II Corinthians 6:17* - Therefore go out from their midst, and be separate from them, says the Lord, and touch no unclean thing; then I will welcome you, (ESV)
#+END_QUOTE

Some problems I see with AI generally where it relates to following Jesus is that AI shouldn't be the first
port of call to seeking to understand the Scripture, or for to day-to-day decision-making.

In both cases using an AI in that way is having a man-in-the-middle of your thought process, where a Christian doesn't want to put up barriers to serving God with a pure devotion to Christ. We want to worship God in spirit and truth:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *John 4:24* - God is spirit, and those who worship him must worship in spirit and truth. (ESV)
#+END_QUOTE

The way that people tend to employ AI personal assistants is to consult them for advice, like oracles that we need guidance from.
But Christians need to have their first allegiance to Christ, and not allow anything to get in the way of that.

This is described here:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *I Corinthians 1:18* - For the word of the cross is folly to those who are perishing, but to us who are being saved it is the power of God. (ESV)
#+END_QUOTE

Also, simple obedience to God really may look like total folly to people who are being led astray by the world - those language models probably factor in a lot of 'wordly' advice, where it's actually the Spirit of God which leads into the truth.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *John 16:13* - When the Spirit of truth comes, he will guide you into all the truth, for he will not speak on his own authority, but whatever he hears he will speak, and he will declare to you the things that are to come. (ESV)
#+END_QUOTE

It's really important that we have software that unyokes us from things which are following a different trajectory, and a different spirit. So the fewer dependencies the better.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *I Corinthians 2:12* - Now we have received not the spirit of the world, but the Spirit who is from God, that we might understand the things freely given us by God. (ESV)
#+END_QUOTE

The world sees Christian reasoning as folly, because God uses the humble the shame the proud, the weak to shame the strong, the foolish (in the world's eyes) to shame the wise:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *I Corinthians 1:27* - But God chose what is foolish in the world to shame the wise; God chose what is weak in the world to shame the strong; (ESV)
#+END_QUOTE

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *Matthew 18:3* - and said, Truly, I say to you, unless you turn and become like children, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven. (ESV)
#+END_QUOTE

As a Christian, we should be aiming for a 'brain-to-God interface', not a brain-to-computer interface, so wedging something right there in the decision-making is not good.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *Isaiah 30:20-21* - And though the Lord give you the bread of adversity and the water of affliction, yet your Teacher will not hide himself anymore, but your eyes shall see your Teacher. And your ears shall hear a word behind you, saying, This is the way, walk in it, when you turn to the right or when you turn to the left.
#+END_QUOTE

We are led by Jesus' spirit:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *Romans 8:14-17* - For all who are led by the Spirit of God are sons of God. For you did not receive the spirit of slavery to fall back into fear, but you have received the Spirit of adoption as sons, by whom we cry, Abba! Father! The Spirit himself bears witness with our spirit that we are children of God, and if children, then heirs—heirs of God and fellow heirs with Christ, provided we suffer with him in order that we may also be glorified with him. (ESV)
#+END_QUOTE

Here's an example of being led by the spirit.
If I were to preach to someone that Jesus has taught that we should give to anyone who asks, and then
right after preaching the commandment, I go for a walk and somebody on the street asks me for money, I would be
aware that being led by the spirit I should comply with Jesus' commandment.

Jesus is the spirit. Jesus' words are spirit and life, etc. Christians are led by the spirit of Jesus. Now if ChatGPT, say, advised me to not because of 'worldly wisdom' which the model had been trained to give, then I have to choose which spirit to be led by. I could choose Jesus out of obedience, or I could be led astray by some other thing, and the point is the AI recommendation is simply not going to align with the will of God for you at that moment every time.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *John 6:63* - It is the Spirit who gives life; the flesh is of no avail. The words that I have spoken to you are spirit and life. (ESV)
#+END_QUOTE

AI etc. is of the world. Christians are led by the spirit of God.

I consider AI fiction to be unclean, just as I would consider commercial software to be unclean, but in its own way.

I'm just claiming an intuition on this one and for my project I plan on adhering to the vision of avoiding AI, but I see no problem with building
information retrieval tools, note-taking tools, etc.

You might've asked a different but related question: What makes commercial software unholy?

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *Matthew 6:24* - No one can serve two masters, for either he will hate the one and love the other, or he will be devoted to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve God and money. (ESV)
#+END_QUOTE

It comes down to what a person is yoked to / dependencies.
Christians are yoked primarily to Christ.
For example, if a Christian believer takes an unbelieving spouse would almost certainly can wreck havoc on their relationship with God.
Now if anything else, tries to wedge itself deeply into some aspect of your life where it starts to demand your attention and it's hard to get rid of and it's taking you away from God, I would consider it to be unclean. And AI fiction I consider to be a noxious weed for several reasons.

I could go on about my opinions but at the end of the day I have my gut.

** TODO Explain to the guy the importance of simply spending time with everyone
II Corinthians 6:16-18 - What agreement has the temple of God with idols? For we are the temple of the living God; as God said, I will make my dwelling among them and walk among them, and I will be their God, and they shall be my people. Therefore go out from their midst, and be separate from them, says the Lord, and touch no unclean thing; then I will welcome you, and I will be a father to you, and you shall be sons and daughters to me, says the Lord Almighty. (ESV)

It's important to not be unevenly yoked.

Holiness is about who you serve primarily. Holiness is being set apart for God.

Now if anything else, tries to wedge itself deeply into some aspect of your life where it starts to demand your attention and
you can't seem to get rid of it, and it's taking you away from God, I would consider it to be unclean.

You might've asked a similar question: What makes commercial software unholy. Well here is your answer:

Matthew 6:24 - No one can serve two masters, for either he will hate the one and love the other, or he will be devoted to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve God and money. (ESV)

To wedge something between Christ and the believer so that a person's decisions start to go against the teaching means that they believer may be unevenly yoked with unbelievers or worldly things,
which we're really trying to stay set apart from.

I value anecdotal evidence over empirical.

A Christian maintains first and foremore allegiance to Christ and obeying Christ.
Unlike Christ Himself, who could maintain perfect faithfulness to Father God despite spending time freely among the faithless,
Christians should not be so confident that they think they can yoke themself to any old thing, or person
and expect to be able to maintain faithfulness to Jesus.

We've got to guard their heart.

1 John 2:15-16: Do not love the world or the things that belong to the world. If anyone loves the world, love for the Father is not in him. For everything that belongs to the world-the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, and the pride in one’s lifestyle—is not from the Father, but is from the world.

#+END_SRC

I do want to ensure it's all programmable. Stuff using diagrams and stuff.

Ideally, I should have the actual electrons display too:

#+BEGIN_SRC text -n :async :results verbatim code :lang text

  ██████ :O : ██████

    ██  ██··██··██
  ██████████████████
    ██████████████
  ██  ██  ██  ██  ██
#+END_SRC

I could syntax highlight it to make it more legible.

S = 6 × 1 = 6
O₃

Valence electrons are the electrons in the
outermost shell, or energy level, of an atom.

For example, oxygen has six valence electrons,
two in the 2s subshell and four in the 2p
subshell.

We can write the configuration of oxygen's
valence electrons as 2s²2p⁴.

** pen-aatr
This splits the document according to the record separator

For example:

  pen-aatr -r "\n\\" cmd-2d-to-1d-block

the ID of each record I want to transform:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash -n :i bash :async :results verbatim code :lang text

#+END_SRC

** grepfilter
This finds within a document things to run an transformation on.

For example, this slugifies IP addresses:

* TODO I really want a 2d shell language
Commands should be able to be represented in 2D quite easily.

=org-babel= is so far my closest solution, but
I think it would be good to improve the
situation somehow - perhaps by expanding and
unexpanding shell script argument strings -
from "\n" to the actual newline and back -
figure out how to do this.

I mean, this works, but it's still not optimal because the ="= get in the way:

#+BEGIN_SRC text -n :async :results verbatim code :lang text
  cmd testing 123 "YO

  YOYO"
  "HI
  THERE"
#+END_SRC

So I think I need to find a representation and then somehow convert between the representations.

** This:
There should be a command called =2d= which preprocesses a string such as the following:

Problems to work out:
- Figure out unicode. q does not like unicode
- Babel doesn't have spaces

*** I still have more work to do on it
#+BEGIN_SRC text :f cmd-2d-to-1d-full :async :results verbatim code :lang text
  echo
  \
   YO|
     |
   2d|
  yo
  \
   Foo
  \
   Bar Baz
  | vsed 's/Y 2/G 3/'
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_src text
echo "YO\n  \n2d" yo Foo  "Bar Baz" | vsed 's/Y 2/G 3/'
#+end_src

should expand to:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash -n :i bash :async :results verbatim code :lang text
  echo "YO\n  \n2d" yo Foo "Bar Baz" | vsed 's/Y 2/G 3/'
#+END_SRC

I think I should probably use emacs lisp for this.

*** Algorithm
1. Extract each block found within the command e.g.:

#+BEGIN_SRC text :f cmd-2d-to-1d-block :async :results verbatim code :lang text
  \
   YO

   2d
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_src text
"YO\n\n2d"
#+end_src

2. Convert each one independently to something like e.g:

#+BEGIN_SRC text -n :async :results verbatim code :lang text
  "YO\n\n2d" \
#+END_SRC

3. Optionally, join all the lines together, removing trailing =\=.

** Also, make it work in bash:

This doesn't work:

#+BEGIN_SRC text -n :async :results verbatim code :lang text
  2d echo  \
  \        \
   YO|     \
     |     \
   2d|     \
  yo       \
  \        \
   Foo     \
  \        \
   Bar Baz \
  | vsed 's/Y 2/G 3'
#+END_SRC

Maybe this will (join consecutive arguments with |...|):

#+BEGIN_SRC text -n :async :results verbatim code :lang text
  2d echo    \
  "|YO|"     \
  "|  |"     \
  "|2d|"     \
  yo         \
  "|Foo|"    \
  "Bar Baz"  \
  | vsed 's/Y 2/G 3'

  Ac 2:26: therefore my heart was glad, and my tongue rejoiced; my flesh also will dwell in hope.
  Ac 2:31: he foresaw and spoke about the resurrection of the Christ, that he was not abandoned to Hades, nor did his flesh see corruption.
  Ro 1:3: concerning his Son, who was descended from David according to the flesh
  Ro 4:1: What then shall we say was gained by Abraham, our forefather according to the flesh?
  Ro 7:5: For while we were living in the flesh, our sinful passions, aroused by the law, were at work in our members to bear fruit for death.
  Ro 7:14: For we know that the law is spiritual, but I am of the flesh, sold under sin.
  Ro 7:18: For I know that nothing good dwells in me, that is, in my flesh. For I have the desire to do what is right, but not the ability to carry it out.
  Ro 7:25: Thanks be to God through Jesus Christ our Lord! So then, I myself serve the law of God with my mind, but with my flesh I serve the law of sin.
  Ro 8:3: For God has done what the law, weakened by the flesh, could not do. By sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh and for sin, he condemned sin in the flesh,
  Ro 8:4: in order that the righteous requirement of the law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not according to the flesh but according to the Spirit.
  Ro 8:5: For those who live according to the flesh set their minds on the things of the flesh, but those who live according to the Spirit set their minds on the things of the Spirit.
  Ro 8:6: To set the mind on the flesh is death, but to set the mind on the Spirit is life and peace.
  Ro 8:7: For the mind that is set on the flesh is hostile to God, for it does not submit to God's law; indeed, it cannot.
  Ro 8:8: Those who are in the flesh cannot please God.
  Ro 8:9: You, however, are not in the flesh but in the Spirit, if in fact the Spirit of God dwells in you. Anyone who does not have the Spirit of Christ does not belong to him.

  1Co 3:1: But I, brothers, could not address you as spiritual people, but as people of the flesh, as infants in Christ.

  1Co 6:16: Or do you not know that he who is joined to a prostitute becomes one body with her? For, as it is written, The two will become one flesh.
  1Co 15:39: For not all flesh is the same, but there is one kind for humans, another for animals, another for birds, and another for fish.

  Ga 4:23: But the son of the slave was born according to the flesh, while the son of the free woman was born through promise.
  Ga 4:29: But just as at that time he who was born according to the flesh persecuted him who was born according to the Spirit, so also it is now.

  1Ti 3:16: Great indeed, we confess, is the mystery of godliness: He was manifested in the flesh, vindicated by the Spirit, seen by angels, proclaimed among the nations, believed on in the world, taken up in glory.
  Pm 1:16: no longer as a slave but more than a slave, as a beloved brother—especially to me, but how much more to you, both in the flesh and in the Lord.
  Heb 2:14: Since therefore the children share in flesh and blood, he himself likewise partook of the same things, that through death he might destroy the one who has the power of death, that is, the devil,

  1P 4:2: so as to live for the rest of the time in the flesh no longer for human passions but for the will of God.

  1Jn 4:2: By this you know the Spirit of God: every spirit that confesses that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is from God,
  2Jn 1:7: For many deceivers have gone out into the world, those who do not confess the coming of Jesus Christ in the flesh. Such a one is the deceiver and the antichrist.

That is achievable, I think.

OK, so what I should do is put this paper which says "I AM COVERED BY THE BLOOD OF JESUS CHRIST, SON OF GOD" above my loins.
And that *should* stop the evil spirits from attacking me there.
I should resist any urge whatsoever.

- Deflections

#+BEGIN_SRC sh -n :sps bash :async :results none :lang text

What I need to do to speed it up:
- make the initial extractor a lot faster
  - With all the books and variants, extract Bible verse references.
  - It's probably best to use emacs for this.
  - I should also do the canonicalising from within that script

Actually, the entire script could be written in emacs lisp.

But think about this... is emacs going to actually be the fastest way?

Parallel sed might actually be faster, or several sed passes.

‾‾‾‾‾‾‾
I have said all these things to you to keep
you from falling away.

They will put you out of the synagogues.

Indeed, the hour is coming when whoever kills
you will think he is offering service to God.

And they will do these things because they
have not known the Father, nor me.

But I have said these things to you, that when
their hour comes you may remember that I told
them to you.

I did not say these things to you from the
beginning, because I was with you.

But now I am going to him who sent me, and
none of you asks me, Where are you going?

But because I have said these things to you,
sorrow has filled your heart.

Nevertheless, I tell you the truth: it is to
your advantage that I go away, for if I do not
go away, the Helper will not come to you.

But if I go, I will send him to you.

And when he comes, he will convict the world
concerning sin and righteousness and judgment:
concerning sin, because they do not believe in
me; concerning righteousness, because I go to
the Father, and you will see me no longer;
concerning judgment, because the ruler of this
world is judged.

I still have many things to say to you, but
you cannot bear them now.

When the Spirit of truth comes, he will guide
you into all the truth, for he will not speak
on his own authority, but whatever he hears he
will speak, and he will declare to you the
things that are to come.

He will glorify me, for he will take what is
mine and declare it to you.

All that the Father has is mine; therefore I
said that he will take what is mine and
declare it to you.

A little while, and you will see me no longer;
and again a little while, and you will see me.

So some of his disciples said to one another,
What is this that he says to us, A little
while, and you will not see me, and again a
little while, and you will see me; and,
because I am going to the Father?

So they were saying, What does he mean by a
little while?

We do not know what he is talking about.

Jesus knew that they wanted to ask him, so he
said to them, Is this what you are asking
yourselves, what I meant by saying, A little
while and you will not see me, and again a
little while and you will see me?

Truly, truly, I say to you, you will weep and
lament, but the world will rejoice.

You will be sorrowful, but your sorrow will
turn into joy.

When a woman is giving birth, she has sorrow
because her hour has come, but when she has
delivered the baby, she no longer remembers
the anguish, for joy that a human being has
been born into the world.

So also you have sorrow now, but I will see
you again and your hearts will rejoice, and no
one will take your joy from you.

In that day you will ask nothing of me.

Truly, truly, I say to you, whatever you ask
of the Father in my name, he will give it to
you.

Until now you have asked nothing in my name.

Ask, and you will receive, that your joy may
be full.

I have said these things to you in figures of
speech.

The hour is coming when I will no longer speak
to you in figures of speech but will tell you
plainly about the Father.

In that day you will ask in my name, and I do
not say to you that I will ask the Father on
your behalf; for the Father himself loves you,
because you have loved me and have believed
that I came from God.

I came from the Father and have come into the
world, and now I am leaving the world and
going to the Father.

His disciples said, Ah, now you are speaking
plainly and not using figurative speech! Now
we know that you know all things and do not
need anyone to question you; this is why we
believe that you came from God.

Jesus answered them, Do you now believe?

Behold, the hour is coming, indeed it has
come, when you will be scattered, each to his
own home, and will leave me alone.

Yet I am not alone, for the Father is with me.

I have said these things to you, that in me
you may have peace.

In the world you will have tribulation.

But take heart; I have overcome the world.

Be not deceived with strange doctrines, nor with old fables, which are unprofitable. For if we still live according to
the Jewish law, we acknowledge that we have not received grace. For the divinest prophets lived according to Christ
Jesus. On this account also they were persecuted, being inspired by His grace to fully convince the unbelieving that
there is one God, who has manifested Himself by Jesus Christ His Son, who is His eternal Word, not proceeding forth from

Do not be idolaters as some of them were; as

drink and rose up to play.

We must not indulge in sexual immorality as
some of them did, and twenty-three thousand
fell in a single day.

We must not put Christ to the test, as some of
them did and were destroyed by serpents, nor
grumble, as some of them did and were
destroyed by the Destroyer.

Now these things happened to them as an
example, but they were written down for our
instruction, on whom the end of the ages has
come.

Therefore let anyone who thinks that he stands
take heed lest he fall.

No temptation has overtaken you that is not
common to man.

God is faithful, and he will not let you be
tempted beyond your ability, but with the
temptation he will also provide the way of
escape, that you may be able to endure it.

Therefore, my beloved, flee from idolatry.

Make a DSL for writing music.

I don't want to write algorithmic music with a DSL, but I'd rather describe eloquently, beautiful music.
How to write it? I should probably design it mysel completely.

Get more and more complicated, attempting to accommodate more and more things into the DSL.

- I need to lay down a chord progression
- And I should also lay down a melody
- And I should just get good at those two things for starters.

** Notations
- [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABC_notation][ABC notation - Wikipedia]]
  - This is cool - very simply, but cool
  - Perhaps it's enough
- [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GUIDO_music_notation][GUIDO music notation - Wikipedia]]
  - This is not as good as LilyPond
- [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LilyPond][LilyPond - Wikipedia]]
  - This can make basically anything

** Intervals
[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interval_(music)][Interval {music} - Wikipedia]]

** Mary had a little lamb

| E1 D1 C1 D1 | E1 E1 E2 .. | D1 D1 D2 .. | E1 G1 G2 .. |

Ephesians 5:11-14
‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾
Do not participate in the unfruitful deeds of
darkness, but instead even expose them; for it
is disgraceful even to speak of the things
which are done by them in secret.

But all things become visible when they are
exposed by the light, for everything that
becomes visible is light.

For this reason it says, “Awake, sleeper, And
arise from the dead, And Christ will shine on
you.”

One day as we were going to the place of
prayer, we were met by a slave girl with a
spirit of divination, who earned a large
income for her masters by fortune-telling.

This girl followed Paul and the rest of us,
shouting, “These men are servants of the Most
High God, who are proclaiming to you the way
of salvation!” She continued this for many
days.

Eventually Paul grew so aggravated that he
turned and said to the spirit, “In the name of
Jesus Christ I command you to come out of
her!” And the spirit left her at that very
moment.

It should bring up either vimdiff or magit diff.
It should let me manually edit the pipeline and remember the edit.
Perhaps the edit itself should be remembered in its own git repository!
Yes!
Set up a git repository for each pipeline edit point.

- Put an edit point into a bash pipeline, and name the edit point

For example:

** For a given stdin, have an associated stdout
By default that stdout is the stdin.
But I should be able to edit it.
This is quite an important file, though. It should be stored somewhere
permanent.

Therefore, two scripts.

Perhaps I should extend =ci= to do this under the hood?, and call it 'store'.
Hmm. Maybe not. Keep it simple.

- store <name>
  - sometimes, it should 'vipe'
- unstore <name>
  - This sets an environment variable which triggers store to edit the store.
