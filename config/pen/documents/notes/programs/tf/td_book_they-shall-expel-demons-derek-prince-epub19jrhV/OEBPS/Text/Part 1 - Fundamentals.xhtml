    <p class="first-para"><span class="dropcap">N</span><span>early two thousand years ago Jesus came to the help of suffering humanity, working miracles by healing the sick and casting out demons. Throughout the three and a half years of His earthly ministry, this never changed.</span></p>

    <p class="body"><span>In the intervening centuries Christian men and women have been called from time to time with miraculous ministries to the sick and afflicted. Yet, as far as I know, there are few, if any, records of people with a ministry of casting out demons comparable to that of Jesus’. As a result, most victims of demonic oppression have been left to suffer without any offer of practical help from the Church.</span></p>

    <p class="body"><span>The time has come, I believe, to clear away the rubble of religious tradition that has obscured the clear revelation of the New Testament, and to re-establish the Church’s ministry on the bedrock of Jesus and the gospels.</span></p>
