Please, LORD Jesus, God help me please.
God help me please.
I need Your help LORD.
Please help me God.
Please clean me God.
Please, LORD God, help Rowdy to trust in You.
Please, God, help Rowdy to trust in You and not be distracted by other things.
Please help him to love You.

LORD God, help him to know You personally and walk in Your ways and to be healed.
In Jesus Christ's name I ask,
