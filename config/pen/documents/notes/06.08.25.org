Dear Heavenly Father and my Lord Jesus Christ and Holy Spirit,
Jehovah, Almighty God,
I understand that the world hates me because I'm not of the world.
But could You please use Your Power, as God, to maybe, speak to me,
if that is OK.
There is this word called grace.
God, I think its graceless of You to not speak to me clearly.
The grace which You've given me feels insufficient.
I'm experiencing extreme persecution, and also extreme neglect from You.
I feel like nothing loves me, not even You, God, because if You loved me now
then You would speak to me.
The fact that You haven't made the confession that I require is a demonstration of hatred towards me,
who loves You and tries to abide in Your word.
