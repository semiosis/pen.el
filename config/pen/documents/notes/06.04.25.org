Dear Heavenly Father, and my Lord Jesus Christ, and Holy Spirit,
Jehovah God,
please, LORD God, help me.
Please, LORD God, make the evil dreams cease.
Please, LORD God, deliver me from evil.
Lord Jesus Christ, it seems like I'm always being ignored by people.
Could You please just set me free in Your name, I ask.
Please God, help me.
Father, Son and Holy Spirit, please deliver me.
Please, God, rescue me.
LORD God Almighty, please deliver me from heretics.
In Jesus Christ's name I ask,
AMEN!!


Dear Heavenly Father, and my Lord Jesus Christ, and Holy Spirit,
Jehovah God,

Deliver me right now in Jesus Christ's name.
Deliver me please God in Jesus Christ's name.
