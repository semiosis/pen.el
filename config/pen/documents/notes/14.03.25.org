Please forgive me Lord Jesus.
God, sin terrifies me.
I just want to be holy.
Please forgive me, LORD.
God I feel wretched.
I'm sorry, LORD.

You've been so good to me.

God, I'm sorry.


Dear Heavenly Father, and my Lord Jesus Christ, and Holy Spirit,
Jehovah God,
please, God, deliver me from this spirit of ejaculation / orgasm which keeps
trying to arouse me in the morning and from these dreams/visions of
death and technology.
It's awful, Lord Jesus.
I just want normal bodily functions and to have good dreams from You only.
Please, God, help me, heal me and deliver me in Jesus Christ's name I ask,
AMEN!!


Dear Heavenly Father, and my Lord Jesus Christ, and Holy Spirit,
Jehovah God,
please, LORD God, guide me into all Your Truth.
Please, LORD God, sanctify my mind, soul and body.
Please, LORD God, deliver me from evil.
In Jesus Christ's name I ask,
AMEN!!


Dear Heavenly Father, and my Lord Jesus Christ, and Holy Spirit,
Jehovah God,
please, LORD God, deliver me from this spirit spouse thing.
Please, God, help me.
What has happened to me is simply not fair.
God, I've been denied marriage.
God, I've been denied relationships and jobs.
The demonic oppression has been horrendous.
If there is now a problem with this disgusting defilement of spirit,
HOW IS IT MY FAULT!
God help me.
Let me marry in Jesus' name.
Let me marry in Jesus' name.
Deliver me, clean me, rescue me in Jesus Christ's name.
Please, God, in Jesus Christ's name, deliver me.
Please, God, help me in Jesus Christ's name.
AMEN!!


Dear Heavenly Father, and my Lord Jesus Christ, and Holy Spirit,
Jehovah God,
God, I want to be clean.
I want to be able to enjoy a relationship with You, LORD God.
I feel like I can't do that unless I am made clean and well.
Please sanctify me and deliver me.
In Jesus Christ's name I ask,
AMEN!!


Please help me Lord Jesus Christ.
God, I consider just going to sleep until I've been healed
because I'm so demoralised by feeling defiled.
But I don't believe it would really help to remain in bed.
Please help me Lord Jesus.


Lord Jesus...
God, I wasn't interested in money.
But, Lord Jesus, You let my marriage prospects be destroyed.
Unbelievable.
Worse, You let me get attacked by demons continually.
I prayed but You did not help me.
You let it get worse and worse and worse.
And all of this happened when I had not enough preparation.
I wasn't taught Your commandments, Jesus.
I wasn't taught in any serious way.
Everything was rigged against me.
And here I am, in this disgusting situation.
It's disgusting on so many levels, LORD.
It's disgusting just in terms of the defilement.
It's also disgusting, LORD, at the injustice.
When will You heal me and deliver me?
Will it be ever?
God I'm sorry.
I despair, LORD, with the stuff affecting my lips, loins, dreams, and chest, etc. and legs.
God, the thing has been so disgusting.
It's really gross, LORD God.
Help me Jesus, please.
Heal me Jesus, please.


Lord Jesus Christ, I do not want to make any mistake.
God please help me.


Lord Jesus Christ forgive me please.
God, I just want to be clean and holy.
God help me.
I need help.
God I do not have enough support to live here in this world.
I need help.
Please make the persecution stop.
Please, God, help me.


Lord Jesus Christ forgive me please.
God Almighty please forgive me.
God I do not know what happened.
Please heal me, God.


Lord Jesus Christ,
God, why is my life so difficult?
God, I hate the AI stuff.
I don't want it to be in the world.

Lord Jesus Christ,
please make that thing go away in Your precious name.
Lord Jesus Christ,
I need You to make it go away.
I need You to deliver me from literally demons.
I need You to speak clearly to me.

Father God, Jehovah God,
God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob,
please, LORD God, deliver me.
Please deliver me from demonic harassment.
Lord Jesus Christ Please HELP ME!
HELP MEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!
Make that damned defilement go away in Jesus Christ's name I ask.
Make it go away, LORD God.
In Jesus Christ's name MAKE IT GO AWAY.
AMEN!!

There is no condemnation for those in Christ Jesus.


Dear Heavenly Father, and my Lord Jesus Christ, and Holy Spirit,
Jehovah God,
please, LORD, in Jesus Christ's name deliver me from these annoying
pro-AI spirits.
Please, God, in Jesus Christ's name deliver me from these spirits which keep setting traps.
It's really annoying.
Please deliver me in Jesus Christ's name I ask,
AMEN!!


- I should let my yes be yes and my no be no more.
- I should avoid engaging in conversations with Matt if I keep
  getting tested through him. He seems to be using threats and slander
  to scare me into saying more with my 'yes'es and my 'no's.

God help me. I feel like I'm in a prison.


Dear Heavenly Father, and my Lord Jesus Christ and Holy Spirit,
Jehovah God,
please, LORD, in Jesus Christ's name deliver me.
AMEN!!
