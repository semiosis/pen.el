Dear Heavenly Father, Jehovah God,
please, LORD, forgive me for all the insubordination I have exhibited.
God Almighty, I'm so, so sorry.
I can see You've been at work in my life.
I'm so sorry, LORD.
In Jesus Christ's name I pray,
AMEN!!


Dear Heavenly Father, Jehovah God,
please, LORD, destroy the lie of "involuntary celibate" which tries to cast this problem in the darkness, in the perspective of looking as though all I wanted was sex.
LORD God, You know that what I'm up against is an anti-marriage spirit.
That's the problem.
Marriage was denied. That's the problem.
My first marriage proposal to someone I love, at the time did love very much - had very nice feelings for.
LORD God, You know what happened on 3 May 2022.
LORD God, You know what my feelings were this entire time for Melee.
LORD God Almighty, please don't let the enemy try to frame this differently.
Literally, satan has been harassing me continually and trying to frame my problems in terms of his lies.
Please, LORD, this is really important.
I do not want this framed any other way than what it truly is.
In Jesus Christ's name I pray,
AMEN!!


In Jesus Christ's name I rebuke that devil trying to frame this as merely involuntary celibacy when the real problem
is that finding a Christian marriage partner seems impossible because the enemy has been attacking my relationships.
Also in Jesus Christ's name I rebuke that devil trying to frame my job hunting problem as an unwillingness to work
when the real problem is that finding work seems impossible because the enemy has been attacking my ability to work.
