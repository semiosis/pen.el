Dear Heavenly Father and my Lord Jesus Christ and Holy Spirit,
Jehovah, Almighty God,
please, LORD, help me to get a simple job somewhere.
In Jesus Christ's name, I ask,
AMEN!!


Please forgive me, Jesus.
You know everything, LORD God.
I'm ashamed.
I also feel like I've been trapped.
I need help, LORD.
I'm sorry, LORD.
I'm freezing cold, I'm unemployed.
Unable to use a heater.
People need my help, and ask me for money,
I don't really have enough money to adequately support myself or my parents.
without finding ways of living more cheaply.
Forgive me, LORD.
God help me please.
LORD God, I'm sorry again for masturbating.
I am sorry, LORD.
I'm freezing code, and are unemployed and slandered all over the internet,
and I haven't been allowed to get married.
LORD God, and the other problem is You haven't been speaking to me directly apart from Your Word.
I need You to deliver me, LORD, in Jesus Christ's name.
I'm sorry, LORD.
I'm really disappointed in myself.
Please, God, forgive me.
LORD God, I'm still being isolated.
Please don't let me get destroyed, God.


Jesus Christ, please give me rest.
I'm so sick and tired of my blood moving through my genitals involuntarily.
God help me.
I'm sick of what's going on.
I'm sick of being kept in this prison.
