#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *I Timothy 4:11-16* - Command and teach these things. Let no one despise you for your youth, but set the believers an example in speech, in conduct, in love, in faith, in purity. Until I come, devote yourself to the public reading of Scripture, to exhortation, to teaching. Do not neglect the gift you have, which was given you by prophecy when the council of elders laid their hands on you. Practice these things, devote yourself to them, so that all may see your progress. Keep a close watch on yourself and on the teaching. Persist in this, for by so doing you will save both yourself and your hearers. (ESV)

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *Romans 2:1-8* - Therefore you have no excuse, O man, every one of you who judges. For in passing judgment on another you condemn yourself, because you, the judge, practice the very same things. We know that the judgment of God rightly falls on those who do such things. Do you suppose, O man—you who judge those who do such things and yet do them yourself—that you will escape the judgment of God? Or do you presume on the riches of his kindness and forbearance and patience, not knowing that God's kindness is meant to lead you to repentance? But because of your hard and impenitent heart you are storing up wrath for yourself on the day of wrath when God's righteous judgment will be revealed. He will render to each one according to his works: to those who by patience in well-doing seek for glory and honor and immortality, he will give eternal life; but for those who are self-seeking and do not obey the truth, but obey unrighteousness, there will be wrath and fury.

  *Romans 2:9-16* - There will be tribulation and distress for every human being who does evil, the Jew first and also the Greek, but glory and honor and peace for everyone who does good, the Jew first and also the Greek. For God shows no partiality. For all who have sinned without the law will also perish without the law, and all who have sinned under the law will be judged by the law. For it is not the hearers of the law who are righteous before God, but the doers of the law who will be justified. For when Gentiles, who do not have the law, by nature do what the law requires, they are a law to themselves, even though they do not have the law. They show that the work of the law is written on their hearts, while their conscience also bears witness, and their conflicting thoughts accuse or even excuse them on that day when, according to my gospel, God judges the secrets of men by Christ Jesus.

We're all going to be judged by the divine standards that we have access to, and everybody has access to divine standards that we fall short of:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *Romans 2:11-12* - For *God shows no partiality*. For all who have sinned without the law will also perish without the law, and all who have sinned under the law will be judged by the law. (ESV)
#+END_QUOTE

It's not "having (having possession of) the law" which counts, but "doing it":

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *Romans 2:13* - For it is not the hearers of the law who are righteous before God, but the doers of the law who will be justified. (ESV)
#+END_QUOTE

We of course may be /imperfect/ doers of the law, especially as Christians because we are justified by our faith in Jesus:

+ [[https://youtube.com/watch?v=clrbUjkbNsM&t=336][Quote by John Piper]] :: A person today may be a doer of the law who trusts Jesus as the only basis of their justification before God, who in the power of that faith by the Spirit walks in a manner worthy of the LORD and then at the last judgement Christ will be the basis of our acceptance - Christ alone, the basis of our acceptance with the Father and our life of obedience doing the law will be brought in to confirm that our faith was real, because faith works through love. So "doing the law" will not be the _basis_ of our being in God's favour, but the evidence that we are trusting Christ, united to Christ, and thus necessary at the last day.

AMEN!! This has totally been my stance, but John Piper hit the nail on the head with this one.

We can certainly "be obedient to God's commandments" and that is "doing":

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *I Peter 1:14-16* - As obedient children, do not be conformed to the passions of your former ignorance, but as he who called you is holy, you also be holy in all your conduct, since it is written, You shall be holy, for I am holy. (ESV)

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *Romans 5:1-2* - Therefore, since we have been justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ. Through him we have also obtained access by faith into this grace in which we stand, and we rejoice in hope of the glory of God. (ESV)

It's time that these be brought low.

False religions:
- sending God's people straight to hell
- false institutions
- false gods
- hide behind a facade of piety
- they make you feel good because you're grouped with like-minded people
- they give you a false peace to remain in your false doctrine and false-religion
- takes away accountability and responsibility for seeking God's face
- the institutions feed the flesh
- like marrying a harlot
- gives spiritual pride
  - this is very serious

By real humility we need to come to the reality of who we are and come to repentance.

Religion makes a barrier to getting to God.

God's children lay it all bare and come to God's feet in true humility, asking to be saved, and asking for their hearts to be exposed so God can do the work in them.

Abide in me, and I in you.

As the branch cannot bear fruit by itself,
unless it abides in the vine, neither can you,
unless you abide in me.

I am the vine; you are the branches.

Whoever abides in me and I in him, he it is

If anyone does not abide in me he is thrown

If you abide in me, and my words abide in you,
ask whatever you wish, and it will be done for

By this my Father is glorified, that you bear

As the Father has loved me, so have I loved
