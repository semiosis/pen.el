Dear Heavenly Father and my Lord Jesus Christ and Holy Spirit,
Jehovah, Almighty God,
please, LORD God, sanctify me and sanctify Mike Miller in Your Truth.
LORD God, please, LORD God, help us to remain obedient to You.
Please deliver us from that spirit of hinduism.
Please deliver us, LORD Jesus Christ.
I condemn that spirit of darkness, that satanic spirit, that spirit of lies that is behind the "hare krishna" religion.
I rebuke it in Jesus Christ's name.
LORD Jesus Christ, I do not desire the things of this world.
But I want what I expect You to give me, sanctification.
I want Your Holiness, LORD God.
In Jesus Christ's name, I ask,
AMEN!!


Dear Heavenly Father and my Lord Jesus Christ and Holy Spirit,
Jehovah, Almighty God,
Lord Jesus Christ, the fact You are allowing my genitals to vibrate like this, makes me think maybe You're a pervert.
It's been such a very long time, and You've not delivered me from this evil thing.
Please, God, I want to live in holiness.
Make it stop in Jesus Christ's name.
If You allow it then You want me to have it.
It's disgusting.
I don't want it.
Make it stop.
I have faith in Your blood.
Now deliver me and sanctify me because I have the right to be a child of God.
I have the right to be cleaned up and made holy.
Now clean me in Jesus Christ's name.
Be faithful and do it.
In Jesus Christ's name, I pray,
AMEN!!


Lord Jesus Christ, I guess that since You refuse to speak to me,
but instead allow me to be harassed by demons, that You do not have love enough to lead me.
LORD God, without love, You cannot lead.
Without love enough to speak to me, You cannot lead.

You Yourself spoke, "By their fruits you will know them."
But, LORD God, the fruit of darkness which is the absence of faithfulness, the absence of compassion, the absence of truthfulness which would lead You to not provide through Holy Spirit the testimony of Yourself,
is not good.
That's bad fruit, LORD.

Where is the good Lord Jesus Christ, the real Jesus, who is faithful to His own word?
That's the one who is my Lord and my God.
That's the one who is truly Jehovah God.
But whatever evil spirit has been allowing me to be terrorised by demons, that is not at all Jehovah God.


Where is the good Lord Jesus Christ, the real Jesus, who sees what happened and is in control?
That's the one who is my Lord and my God.
That's the one who is truly Jehovah God.
But whatever nasty demon has been allowing me to be terrorised by demons for 2 years, that thing I pray goes to hell.


Lord Jesus Christ, let me continue my conversations and not be cut off in Jesus Christ's name.
I need conversations that are long enough.
Lord Jesus Christ, You have allowed me to be put into a pit.
I need You to get me out of it.
Hurry up.
You blaspheme Yourself every minute You allow me to be in this spiritual prison.
Deliver me immediately, Christ Jesus, in Your name.
AMEN!!


Lord Jesus Christ, You need to deliver me.
If You don't deliver me then You blaspheme Yourself.
You *must* deliver me.
It's true that You must.
If You don't then You're a liar because You say You will save but You don't save.
God have mercy on anyone who puts their trust in You but You lead them into a pit.
God help that person.
Please, LORD Jesus Christ, please be who the Scripture says You are.
Please be Almighty God.
Please be faithful and true.
Please, LORD God, be the God who gave their flesh to set me free.
Lord Jesus Christ deliver me please.
In Jesus Christ's name, I ask,
AMEN!!


Lord Jesus Christ, I felt those blood movements in my genitals again immediately after praying to You.
That spiritual defilement remains.
In allowing that to happen, You blaspheme Yourself.
When I go home, I suppose that I will continue to write.
I want to lead people to the Truth.
And the Truth of the fact that I have been harassed by demons
after being born-again and endeavoring to serve You with my whole allegiance, is something that all who read my testimony will know.
Please, LORD, for Your own namesake, please, God, deliver me.
Jesus Christ, I'm asking You to not blaspheme Yourself.
I don't want Your name to be tarnished.
I just want people to know the Truth.
A scientist goes where the evidence leads.


Deliver me.
I do not want to be in this world.
You allowed me to be put into a situation that is so heinous, so disgusting, so unloving, and You forsook me.
You didn't even speak to me.
That's wickedness, LORD.
And God Almighty knows hates the wicked.

  *I Samuel 2:6-10* - The LORD kills and brings to life; he brings down to Sheol and raises up. The LORD makes poor and makes rich; he brings low and he exalts. He raises up the poor from the dust; he lifts the needy from the ash heap to make them sit with princes and inherit a seat of honor. For the pillars of the earth are the LORD's, and on them he has set the world. He will guard the feet of his faithful ones, but the wicked shall be cut off in darkness, for not by might shall a man prevail. The adversaries of the LORD shall be broken to pieces; against them he will thunder in heaven. The LORD will judge the ends of the earth; he will give strength to his king and exalt the power of his anointed. (ESV)

Lord Jesus Christ, it makes absolutely no sense to me why You have not yet set me free.
You're just not really being faithful to me about this.
I get the sense that You are working sometimes.
But You don't give me hard-evidence.
I said deliver me.
Is this going to be how You wish to be known, LORD?
As the shepherd who leads his sheep into hell and abandons them?
Who doesn't even speak to his sheep, but instead allows demons to harass continually?
Who doesn't sanctify, but actually, puts them into a situation worse than when they started?
A shepherd who allows this is no shepherd at all, and certainly not a good one.
The time is up, LORD. I want deliverance now.


Please, LORD, let my soul be healed, and OK.
