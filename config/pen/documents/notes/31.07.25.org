Dear Heavenly Father and my Lord Jesus Christ and Holy Spirit,
Jehovah, Almighty God,
please, LORD God, strengthen Brian.
Please lead his two sisters to faith in You through Jesus Christ.
Please, LORD God, generously give Your Holy Spirit to Brian
and if it is Your will, and in Your timing, to his two sisters.
Please, LORD God, help Brian to do his work at the university.
And, LORD God, also be with Simon Guest.
Please, LORD God, also help Simon in his work and his family.
LORD God, please, LORD God, help all of Simon's family members to come to faith in You, LORD God, through the Lord Jesus Christ,
and be with his family.
Please, LORD God, sanctify them all in Your Truth, God-willing.
If You are willing, LORD God, please lavish them them all with Your Holy Spirit abundantly,
and sanctify them all in Your Truth, LORD God.
In Jesus Christ's name, I ask,
AMEN!!


Dear Heavenly Father and my Lord Jesus Christ and Holy Spirit,
Jehovah, Almighty God,
You can truly see all my thoughts, LORD.
God forgive me.
Please, LORD, don't let me die.
Lord Jesus Christ, forgive me.
I'm so sorry.
You've been good to me.
I don't think I've been humble enough to avoid getting myself in the bad situation I got myself in.
I'm sorry, LORD.
