Dear Heavenly Father, Jehovah, Almighty God,
Lord Jesus Christ, and Holy Spirit,
please, God, forgive me for getting frustrated and angry.
LORD God, I am so tired.
I just want to hear from You.
My mind has been been under siege so much, LORD.
Please forgive me, LORD, for when I have spoken incorrectly.
Please forgive me, LORD, for any deceit which I have had.
Father God, bad company spoils good morals.

I'm so tired, LORD.
Please, God, help me to be set apart for Your purposes and will.
In Jesus Christ's name I ask,
AMEN!!
