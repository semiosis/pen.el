Dear Heavenly Father, and my Lord Jesus Christ,
I know that I am saved by Your grace towards me, LORD God.
I believe that.
Please, God, forgive me.
I get things wrong, God.
Please, God, help me to put sin to death.
God this, spiritual harassment is awful.
Please help me God.
Please make the harassment stop.
It's awful.
Please, God, I don't want to die.
Please, God, I don't want to be imagining disgusting things.
I need You to protect me.
Please protect me God.
Please, God, help me.
Please, God, heal me.
Please, Lord Jesus Christ, Son of God, lead me into all the Truth, and sanctify me.
Please, God, help me, clean me, protect me, guide me in paths of righteousness for Your sake.
Protect me God in Jesus Christ's name I ask.
Please help me Jesus.
In Jesus Christ's name I ask,
AMEN!!


Dear Heavenly Father, and my Lord Jesus Christ,
please, LORD, help me.
Clean me LORD Jesus, please.
Make it so that I do not have any issues with things harassing me at night and
with movement in my loins,
and strange sensations through my body.
LORD Jesus, it's very clear that I've been attacked by "legions" of demons.
Please, God, in Jesus Christ's name help me.
Please, God, in Jesus Christ's name please help me.
AMEN!!
