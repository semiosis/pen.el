Dear Heavenly Father, and my Lord Jesus Christ, and Holy Spirit,
Jehovah God,
please, God, this is Your record.
You have allowed demons to destroy any potential marriage for myself.
You have allowed me to be attacked by demons continually.
A huge amount of the spiritual attack I have received has come through Your church.
Deliver me in the name of Jesus Christ.
Make the evil stop in Jesus Christ's name.
You better deliver me.
If I'm being oppressed by demons as they're stealing from me,
then what are You doing LORD?
You need to deliver me from demonic harassment.
You should have done that long ago.
You should have spoken to me long ago.
Speak to me clearly and instruct me in Jesus Christ's name.
And restore to me marriage.
In Jesus Christ's name I ask,
AMEN!!


I rebuke that spirit which has been denying me marriage.
I condemn that disgusting spirit which has been denying marriage.

Deliver me in th name of Jesus Christ I ask.

In Jesus Christ's name just speak to me, and protect me from evil.

Dear Heavenly Father, and my Lord Jesus Christ,

Dear Heavenly Father, and my Lord Jesus Christ, and Holy Spirit,
Jehovah God,
Father God and Lord Jesus, it's disgusting that I would even get pictures
in my mind even of Peanuts' Charlie Brown kissing Lucy.
And the reason is because demons should not be controlling my relationships.
I want freedom.
If I were to ever meet the girl of my dreams, I would not want
the surprise to be taken away, and I certainly would not
want demons to have any part in it.
God, I want to be delivered from this torment.
I want to be delivered now in Jesus Christ's name.
I do not want evil things harassing me.
Lord Jesus Christ, I do not want to be harassed by demons.
Please make the demonic harassment stop in Jesus Christ's name I ask.
God Almighty, deliver me in Jesus Christ's name I ask,
AMEN!!


I rebuke those demons which keep interrupting and terminating my conversations in Jesus Christ's name.


Dear Heavenly Father, and my Lord Jesus Christ,
and Holy Spirit,
Jehovah God,
please, LORD, keep the faith of my brothers James, Ryan, Josh and Callum
in You strong, and in Jesus Christ Your Son strong.
Please, God, keep their faith strong.
Please lead them into a close relationship with You, LORD God.
Please walk closely with them.
In Jesus Christ's name I ask,
AMEN!!


Dad woke up early this morning to pray for my brothers and their families.
I believe that's true.
I also remember this morning I think overhearing dad say something
like, "he needs spiritual help to get the breakthrough" or something.

Dad is very genuine.
He's been praying very genuinely.

Also, dad told me today he was listening to Sproul preach a sermon on [[https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke%206%3A46&version=ESV][Luke 6:46]],
I think. Someone named Stephen who had gone with him to Vanuatu, I think, had suggested
it to him.

<2025-03-06 Thu> I saw Robin Taylor at Open Heaven tonight
He got a 1-way ticket to Dunedin! Yay!
That's awesome.


Dear Heavenly Father, and my Lord Jesus Christ,
and Holy Spirit, Jehovah God,
please help me, LORD God.
Lord Jesus, please God, help us.
I'm so tired.
I'm sorry, Lord Jesus.
I'm sorry for all of my complaining today.
Once again, You show me that You are faithful and You see and are working.
God, I am so sorry.
I'm so tired, Lord Jesus.
Please forgive me Lord Jesus Christ.
God, I get glimpses that You are working in my life.
I'm so tired and depressed.
Lord Jesus Christ, I do not understand what this
stuff is making me wake up at night.
I feel as though there is a spirit having sex with me or something.
God help me please.
Please deliver me, LORD Jesus.
Please, LORD God, forgive me for getting impatient and saying things out of impatience.
LORD God, I am over this world.
I just want to go home.
God please, God, take me home.
I'm not at home in Dunedin.
My spiritual home is in heaven with You, LORD God.
Please deliver me, LORD God, from this world.
In Jesus Christ's name I ask,
AMEN!!
