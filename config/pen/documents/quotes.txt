@dr.kenmahood4917 - Greatest man in history who had no servants yet they called him MASTER. He had no degree, yet they called him TEACHER.  He had no medicines, yet they called him HEALER.  He had no army yet kings feared him.  He won no military battles, yet He conquered the world.  He committed no crime, yet they crucified Him.  He was buried in a tomb yet HE LIVES TODAY......His name is JESUS!
