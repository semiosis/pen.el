In John 17, Jesus says he has imparted glory to His disciples.
If someone is born-again, their sins up to this point are forgiven.
After this point that person must stop sinning, and if thy sin they have an advocate with God the Father, our Lord Jesus.
God is greater than our heart - He sees the full picture.
So long as a person is forgiving others and confessing their sin, God is faithful and just to forgive, even the sins we do not see.

Freely you have received, therefore freely give.
Henceforth, it's important to be gracious with others.

It's probable that having received the Holy Spirit a person may be then tested.
This test may test to see if someone is a true disciple of Jesus.
If a person has belongings when they are tested, they may need to sell them and give to the poor.
The person must die with repect to the world in order to be used maximally by Jesus for the Kingdom.
When the test comes, the person is faced with perceived unfairness against them.
A person must humble themself.
But keep in mind Romans 3:23 -- for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God.
We are all guilty and grace is only given to those who can recognise that.
Even after being born-again, humbling is required, and humbling to the point where that person is
walking as Jesus walked, in His commandments.
If you have received much, then much is required of you.
During the trial and even after the trial, every scenario which challenges the person to
demonstrate the character andd righteousness of Christ through following His commandments, is
a potential good work which had actaully been prepared in advance for the newborn Christian to walk in.

While following in Jesus' commandments, a person remains in Jesus' love, and
the blood of Jesus cleanses us from sin.

Jesus' commandments are a law of liberty, and following them we give mercy to
others. While giving mercy to others, we ourselves are able to receive mercy from God.
