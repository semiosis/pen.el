DOMINION ðŸ•‡

_Statement of Intent_: We, the sons of God and teh Ecclesia of the Lord Jesus Christ,
claim dominion and sovereignty over the land for Jesus in accordance with the Word of God
and the power of the blood of the eternal covenant of Jesus Christ.

We proclaim and degree: that the Word of God contained in this scroll of rememberance goes forth
declaring the promises and covenant blessings in power and purpose as directed by the God
of Heaven and Earth; that the Kingdom of Heaven has clear and unimpeded access to this land
so that the angels of the Lord can ascend and descend and be legally established in their
terratorial authority
