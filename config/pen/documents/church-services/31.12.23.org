Romans 8:1-6
‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾
Therefore there is now no condemnation for
those who are in Christ Jesus.

For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ
Jesus has set you free from the law of sin and
of death.

For what the Law could not do, weak as it was
through the flesh, God did: sending His own
Son in the likeness of sinful flesh and as an
offering for sin, He condemned sin in the
flesh, so that the requirement of the Law
might be fulfilled in us, who do not walk
according to the flesh but according to the
Spirit.

For those who are according to the flesh set
their minds on the things of the flesh, but
those who are according to the Spirit, the
things of the Spirit.

For the mind set on the flesh is death, but
the mind set on the Spirit is life and peace,

The next day John seeth Jesus coming unto him,
and saith, Behold the Lamb of God, which
taketh away the sin of the world.

This is he of whom I said, After me cometh a
man which is preferred before me: for he was
before me.

And I knew him not: but that he should be made
manifest to Israel, therefore am I come
baptizing with water.

And John bare record, saying, I saw the Spirit
descending from heaven like a dove, and it
abode upon him.

But you did not learn Christ in this way, if
indeed you have heard Him and have been taught
in Him, just as truth is in Jesus, that, in
reference to your former manner of life, you
lay aside the old self, which is being
corrupted in accordance with the lusts of
deceit, and that you be renewed in the spirit
of your mind, and put on the new self, which
in the likeness of God has been created in
righteousness and holiness of the truth.

(NASB)

Clothes are something you put over yourself.
But this new self comes from God's spirit connecting with our spirit.
It's Christ in us.
It permeates everything.

But fornication, and all uncleanness, or

you, as becometh saints; Neither filthiness,
nor foolish talking, nor jesting, which are
not convenient: but rather giving of thanks.

For this ye know, that no whoremonger, nor
unclean person, nor covetous man, who is an
idolater, hath any inheritance in the kingdom
of Christ and of God.

The desire of a man is his kindness: and a

The fear of YHWH tendeth to life: and he that
hath it shall abide satisfied; he shall not be
visited with evil.
