‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾
Beloved, let us love one another: for love is
of God; and every one that loveth is born of
God, and knoweth God.

He that loveth not knoweth not God; for God is
love.

In this was manifested the love of God toward
us, because that God sent his only begotten
Son into the world, that we might live through
him.

Herein is love, not that we loved God, but
that he loved us, and sent his Son to be the
propitiation for our sins.

This is that Moses, which said unto the
children of Israel, A prophet shall the Lord
your God raise up unto you of your brethren,
like unto me; him shall ye hear.

This is he, that was in the assembly in the
wilderness with the angel which spake to him
in the mount Sinai, and with our fathers: who
received the living oracles to give unto us:
To whom our fathers would not obey, but thrust
him from them, and in their hearts turned back
again into Egypt,

Moses was giving the anscestors the word of God and they didn't want to listen.

And it shall come to pass, that whosoever will

And Moses made a bronze serpent and set it on the 
standard; and it came about, that if a serpent 
bit any man, when he looked to the bronze 
serpent, he lived.

He removed the high places and broke down the 
sacred pillars and cut down the Asherah. He also 
broke in pieces the bronze serpent that Moses had 
made, for until those days the sons of Israel 
burned incense to it; and it was called Nehushtan.

God took care of the body of Moses. Perhaps if the people had it they would have made an idol out of him.

Joseph protested against Potiphar's wife - he was defending being faithful to God.

The Bible does *not* say that Joseph protested his innocence, though. That's probably why he ended up being in jail.

In fact, being faithful to God would involve entrusting oneself to God for God to avenge.

The Lord was with him.

Joseph didn't have the Bible - it hadn't been written.
He couldn't read about the faithfulness of God throughout generations in the Old Testament and New Testament.
He would have only had what was taught to him about God through his father and anscestors.

The only written thing we know of that could have possibly existed in those days is the book of Job.

- He probably knew that God had created all things.
- He probably knew about the promise given to Abraham.
- other knowledge from that time
- His grandfather would have told him some things about Isaac who was still alive when his grandfather was 5 years old and he would have most likely known about the story of Abraham and Isaac.

** God is sovereign
In Joseph's life, God is ordering everything that happens to him.

**** satan seeks to prevent this
