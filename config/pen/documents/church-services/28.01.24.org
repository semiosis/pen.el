And Jesus answered him, Blessed are you, Simon
Bar-Jonah! For flesh and blood has not
revealed this to you, but my Father who is in
heaven.

And I tell you, you are Peter, and on this
rock I will build my church, and the gates of
hell shall not prevail against it.

I will give you the keys of the kingdom of
heaven, and whatever you bind on earth shall
be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on
earth shall be loosed in heaven.

And I will place on his shoulder the key of

He shall open, and none shall shut; and he
