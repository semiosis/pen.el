And Mary said: “My soul exalts the Lord, And
my spirit has rejoiced in God my Savior.

“For He has had regard for the humble state of
His bondslave; For behold, from this time on
all generations will count me blessed.

“For the Mighty One has done great things for
me; And holy is His name.

“And His mercy is upon generation after
generation Toward those who fear Him.

“He has done mighty deeds with His arm; He has
scattered those who were proud in the thoughts
of their heart.

“He has brought down rulers from their
thrones, And has exalted those who were
humble.

“He has filled the hungry with good things;
And sent away the rich empty-handed.

“He has given help to Israel His servant, In
remembrance of His mercy, As He spoke to our
fathers, To Abraham and his descendants
forever.”

Now when they had gone, behold, an angel of
the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream and
said, “Get up! Take the Child and His mother
and flee to Egypt, and remain there until I
tell you; for Herod is going to search for the
Child to destroy Him.” So Joseph got up and
took the Child and His mother while it was
still night, and left for Egypt.

Then Moses said, “What if they will not
believe me or listen to what I say?

For they may say, ‘The LORD has not appeared
to you.’” The LORD said to him, “What is that
in your hand?” And he said, “A staff.” Then He
said, “Throw it on the ground.” So he threw it
on the ground, and it became a serpent; and
Moses fled from it.

But the LORD said to Moses, “Stretch out your
hand and grasp it by its tail”--so he
stretched out his hand and caught it, and it
became a staff in his hand--

He is the image of the invisible God, the
firstborn of all creation.

For by Him all things were created, both in
the heavens and on earth, visible and
invisible, whether thrones or dominions or
rulers or authorities--all things have been
created through Him and for Him.

He is before all things, and in Him all things
hold together.

He is also head of the body, the church; and
He is the beginning, the firstborn from the
dead, so that He Himself will come to have
first place in everything.

For it was the Father’s good pleasure for all
the fullness to dwell in Him, and through Him
to reconcile all things to Himself, having
made peace through the blood of His cross;
through Him, I say, whether things on earth or
things in heaven.

Have this attitude in yourselves which was
also in Christ Jesus, who, although He existed
in the form of God, did not regard equality
with God a thing to be grasped, but emptied
Himself, taking the form of a bond-servant,
and being made in the likeness of men.

Being found in appearance as a man, He humbled
Himself by becoming obedient to the point of
death, even death on a cross.

For this reason also, God highly exalted Him,
and bestowed on Him the name which is above
every name, so that at the name of Jesus every
knee will bow, of those who are in heaven and
on earth and under the earth, and that every
tongue will confess that Jesus Christ is Lord,
to the glory of God the Father.

Now in those days a decree went out from
Caesar Augustus, that a census be taken of all
the inhabited earth.

This was the first census taken while
Quirinius was governor of Syria.

And everyone was on his way to register for
the census, each to his own city.

Joseph also went up from Galilee, from the
city of Nazareth, to Judea, to the city of
David which is called Bethlehem, because he
was of the house and family of David, in order
to register along with Mary, who was engaged
to him, and was with child.

While they were there, the days were completed
for her to give birth.

And she gave birth to her firstborn son; and
she wrapped Him in cloths, and laid Him in a
manger, because there was no room for them in
the inn.

In the same region there were some shepherds
staying out in the fields and keeping watch
over their flock by night.

And an angel of the Lord suddenly stood before
them, and the glory of the Lord shone around
them; and they were terribly frightened.

But the angel said to them, “Do not be afraid;
for behold, I bring you good news of great joy
which will be for all the people; for today in
the city of David there has been born for you
a Savior, who is Christ the Lord.

This will be a sign for you: you will find a
baby wrapped in cloths and lying in a manger.”
And suddenly there appeared with the angel a
multitude of the heavenly host praising God
and saying, “Glory to God in the highest, And
on earth peace among men with whom He is
pleased.” When the angels had gone away from
them into heaven, the shepherds began saying
to one another, “Let us go straight to
Bethlehem then, and see this thing that has
happened which the Lord has made known to us.”
So they came in a hurry and found their way to
Mary and Joseph, and the baby as He lay in the
manger.

When they had seen this, they made known the
statement which had been told them about this
Child.

And all who heard it wondered at the things
which were told them by the shepherds.

But Mary treasured all these things, pondering
them in her heart.

The shepherds went back, glorifying and
praising God for all that they had heard and
seen, just as had been told them.

And when eight days had passed, before His
circumcision, His name was then called Jesus,
the name given by the angel before He was
conceived in the womb.
