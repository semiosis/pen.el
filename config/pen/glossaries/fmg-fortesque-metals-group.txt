MLV
Mapping Light Vehicle

    Right, so i guess an ATC8010 in an MLV
    is probably not technically operating as
    an AECM, since it's not an autonomous
    system.

    But for all intents and purposes I will be
    trying to keep the terrain mapper project
    consistent with ALV, so i'll probably
    refer to it as an AECM if i need to

FMEA
Failure Mode and Effects Analysis
    A structured approach to discovering
    potential failures that may exist within
    the design of a product or process.
    
    Failure modes are the ways in which a
    process can fail.
    
    Effects are the ways that these failures
    can lead to waste, defects or harmful
    outcomes for the customer.

    The process of reviewing as many
    components, assemblies, and subsystems as
    possible to identify potential failure
    modes in a system and their causes and
    effects.
