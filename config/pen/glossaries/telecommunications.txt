Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol
    A network management protocol used on
    Internet Protocol networks whereby a DHCP
    server dynamically assigns an IP address
    and other network configuration parameters
    to each device on a network so they can
    communicate with other IP networks.

NetFlow
    NetFlow is a feature that was introduced
    on Cisco routers around 1996 that provides
    the ability to collect IP network traffic
    as it enters or exits an interface.

bastion host
bastion host
    A special-purpose computer on a network
    specifically designed and configured to
    withstand attacks.
    
    The computer generally hosts a single
    application, for example a proxy server,
    and all other services are removed or
    limited to reduce the threat to the
    computer.

Linux cluster
    A connected array of Linux computers or
    nodes that work together and can be viewed
    and managed as a single system.
    
    Nodes are usually connected by fast local
    area networks, with each node running its
    own instance of Linux.
    
    Nodes may be physical or VMs, and they may
    be separated geographically.
    
    Each node includes storage capacity,
    processing power and I/O (input/output)
    Multiple redundant nodes of Linux servers
    may be connected as a cluster for high
    availability (HA) in a network or data
    center, where each node is capable of
    failure detection and recovery.

edge router
    An edge router is a specialized router
    located at a network boundary that enables
    an internal network to connect to external
    networks. They are primarily used at two
    demarcation points: the wide area network
    (WAN) and the internet.

Bullet™M
    Pair with any antenna for airMAX®
    deployment in Point-to-Point (PtP)
    bridging or Point-to-MultiPoint (PtMP)
    applications.

OSI
Open System Interconnection
    [model]

    Defines a networking framework to implement protocols in seven layers.

    The 7 Layers of the OSI:
    Layer 7 - Application.
    Layer 6 - Presentation.
    Layer 5 - Session.
    Layer 4 - Transport.
    Layer 3 - Network.
    Layer 2 - Data Link.
    Layer 1 - Physical.

out-of-band
    Activity outside a defined
    telecommunications frequency band, or,
    metaphorically, outside some other kind of
    activity.
    
    Protection from falsing is among its
    purposes.

code signing
    The method of using a certificate-based
    digital signature to sign executables and
    scripts in order to verify the author’s
    identity and ensure that the code has not
    been changed or corrupted since it was
    signed by the author.
    
    This helps users and other software to
    determine whether the software can be
    trusted.

certificate authority
CA

signing certificate
    Acts as a digital signature.

    When you sign data, you include your
    digital signature with the data.
    
    A certificate contains information that
    fully identifies an entity, and is issued
    by a CA after that authority has verified
    the entity's identity.

Authentication
    [#code signing]

    Verifying who the author of the software
    is.

Integrity
    [#code signing]

    Verifying that the software hasn’t been
    tampered with since it was signed.

Classless inter-domain routing
CIDR
    A set of Internet protocol (IP) standards
    that is used to create unique identifiers
    for networks and individual devices.
    
    The IP addresses allow particular
    information packets to be sent to specific
    computers.

firm
    Commercial partnership of two or more
    people.

conglomerate
large corporation
conglomerate firms
    A thing consisting of a number of
    different and distinct parts or items that
    are grouped together.

Cisco
    [conglomerate]

    Develops, manufactures and sells
    networking hardware, telecommunications
    equipment and other high-technology
    services and products.

net-tools
    The collection of base networking
    utilities for Linux.

    This contains the 'ifconfig' and 'route'
    commands.

iproute
iproute2
    A collection of userspace utilities for
    controlling and monitoring various aspects
    of networking in the Linux kernel,
    including routing, network interfaces,
    tunnels, traffic control, and network-
    related device drivers.

    This contains the 'ip' and 'ss' commands.

ss
    [iproute command]

    Used to dump socket statistics.
    
    It allows showing information similar to
    netstat.
    
    It can display more TCP and state
    informations than other tools.


Address Resolution Protocol
ARP

arp
    Displays and modifies entries in the ARP
    cache, which contains one or more tables
    that are used to store IP addresses and
    their resolved Ethernet or Token Ring
    physical addresses.
    
    There is a separate table for each
    Ethernet or Token Ring network adapter
    installed on your computer.

PoE
Power Over Ethernet

PoE Injectors
    Plugs into an electric outlet and adds
    power through a single network cable,
    transferring both power and data to a
    device.
    
    The injector is the device that inserts
    the power into the wires within the
    Ethernet cable.
