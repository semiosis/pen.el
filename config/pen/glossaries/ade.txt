ADE Development Environment
    A modular Docker-based tool to ensure that
    all developers in a project have a common,
    consistent development environment.

    start and run the Docker container with
    the correct docker run options.
    
    However, a power user of Docker may find
    certain options missing.

    arguments to docker run.

Docker
    Allows the creation of containers with
    isolated resources from the host OS:
    
    A computer program that performs
    operating-system-level virtualization also
    known as containerization.

Image
    Snapshots of the filesystem for a
    container.
    
    They are based on a Dockerfile, and are
    created using docker build.
    
    Images can be uploaded to a registry,
    where they can be downloaded by others.

Container
    A running instance of an image.
    
    When a container is deleted, any changes
    to its filesystem are usually discarded.
    
    A container can publish parts of its
    filesystem as volumes, which can then be
    mounted by other containers.

Registry
    A server-side application that stores pre-
    built Docker images.
