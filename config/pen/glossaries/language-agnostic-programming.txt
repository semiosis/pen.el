Protocol Buffers
    Protocol buffers are Google's language-
    neutral, platform-neutral, extensible
    mechanism for serializing structured data
    – think XML, but smaller, faster, and
    simpler.
    
    You define how you want your data to be
    structured once, then you can use special
    generated source code to easily write and
    read your structured data to and from a
    variety of data streams and using a
    variety of languages.
    
    Protocol Buffers are Schema Of Messages.
    
    They are language agnostic.
    
    They can be converted to binary and
    converted back to message formats using
    the code generated by the protoc compiler
    for various languages.
