samskara
    In Indian philosophy and Indian religions,
    samskaras or sanskaras (Sanskrit: संस्कार)
    are mental impressions, recollections, or
    psychological imprints.

    In Hindu philosophies, samskaras are a
    basis for the development of karma theory.

    In Buddhism the Sanskrit term Samskara is
    used to describe 'formations'.

    In Pali it is referred to as Saṅkhāra.

    According to various schools of Indian
    philosophy, every action, intent or
    preparation by an individual leaves a
    samskara (impression, impact, imprint) in
    the deeper structure of the person's mind.

    These impressions then await volitional
    fruition in that individual's future, in
    the form of hidden expectations,
    circumstances or a subconscious sense of
    self-worth.

    These Samskaras manifest as tendencies,
    karmic impulses, subliminal impressions,
    habitual potencies or innate dispositions.

    In ancient Indian texts, the theory of
    Samskara explains how and why human beings
    remember things, and the effect that
    memories have on people's suffering,
    happiness and contentment.

geosynchronous
geostationary
    Most communications satellites today are
    what are known as geosynchronous or
    geostationary, which is to say that they
    orbit the same axis around which the Earth

    altitude that permits their orbital period
    to be equal to the time it takes for Earth
    to perform a full rotation, as it does
    each 86,164 seconds.

    This has the neat side effect of the

Hausdorff dimension
fractal dimension
    A measure of roughness and/or chaos that
    was first introduced in 1918 by
    mathematician Felix Hausdorff.

    For instance, the Hausdorff dimension of a
    single point is zero, of a line segment is
    1, of a square is 2, and of a cube is 3.

    That is, for sets of points that define a
    smooth shape or a shape that has a small
    number of corners—the shapes of
    traditional geometry and science—the
    Hausdorff dimension is an integer agreeing
    with the usual sense of dimension, also
    known as the topological dimension.

    However, formulas have also been developed
    that allow calculation of the dimension of
    other less simple objects, where, solely
    on the basis of their properties of
    scaling and self-similarity, one is led to
    the conclusion that particular
    objects—including fractals—have non-
    integer Hausdorff dimensions.

    Because of the significant technical
    advances made by Abram Samoilovitch
    Besicovitch allowing computation of
    dimensions for highly irregular or "rough"
    sets, this dimension is also commonly
    referred to as the Hausdorff–Besicovitch
    dimension.

provenance
    The place of origin or earliest known
    history of something.

    Emacs has provenance -- that's a big
    reason why I choose to use it.

    The provenance of a piece of data is the
    process that led to that piece of data

    From the French provenir, 'to come
    from/forth'.

    The chronology of the ownership, custody
    or location of a historical object.

    Originally mostly used in relation to
    works of art but is now used in similar
    senses in a wide range of fields,
    including archaeology, paleontology,
    archives, manuscripts, printed books, the
    circular economy, and science and
    computing.

    The primary purpose of tracing the
    provenance of an object or entity is
    normally to provide contextual and
    circumstantial evidence for its original
    production or discovery, by establishing,
    as far as practicable, its later history,
    especially the sequences of its formal
    ownership, custody and places of storage.

    The practice has a particular value in
    helping authenticate objects.

Pleonasm
    v +/"Pleonasm is the use of unneeded words" "$HOME/Calibre Library/Mark Forsyth/The Elements of Eloquence (6)/The Elements of Eloquence - Mark Forsyth.txt"

    The use of unneeded words that are
    superfluous and unnecessary in a sentence
    that doesn't require them.

    It's repeating the same thing again twice,
    and it annoys and irritates people.

    Some cannot see a pleonasm without flying
    into a furious rage.

    But that is rather silly.

    There are three different varieties of
    pleonasm: the tiny, the lazy, and the
    lovely.

Hyperbole
    The technical term for exaggeration, and
    even though we have literally thousands of
    English words that mean the same thing,
    hyperbole is one of the few technical
    Greek rhetorical terms that absolutely
    everybody knows.

    That may be because we exaggerate
    constantly.

    The human being is the great embroiderer.

    It's not enough for us to say that we
    waited for ten minutes; we have to wait
    "for ages."

    If I've told you twice, I've told you a
    thousand times.

    If you're rich, you have a ton of money.

    It's enough to make you break down in a
    flood of tears.

    of individual interest in mathematics and
    CS, in particular in relation to the

    “To know and not to know, to be conscious
    of complete truthfulness while telling
    carefully constructed lies, to hold
    simultaneously two opinions which
    cancelled out, knowing them to be
    contradictory and believing in both of
    them, to use logic against logic, to
    repudiate morality while laying claim to
    it, to believe that democracy was
    impossible and that the Party was the
    guardian of democracy, to forget whatever
    it was necessary to forget, then to draw
    it back into memory again at the moment
    when it was needed, and then promptly to
    forget it again, and above all, to apply
    the same process to the process
    itself—that was the ultimate subtlety:
    consciously to induce unconsciousness, and
    then, once again, to become unconscious of
    the act of hypnosis you had just
    performed.

    Even to understand the
    word—doublethink—involved the use of
    doublethink.”

    Four examples of doublethink used
    throughout 1984 include the slogans:
    - War is Peace,
    - Freedom is Slavery,
    - Ignorance is Strength, and
    - 2 + 2 = 5.

known
    In a classic theory of knowledge, there

    Belief
        Pretty self-explanatory, you believe
        that what you think is true. Example:
        I believe an elephant has grey skin.

    Justification
        You have a reason to think you belief
        is true. Example: I heard someone say
        elephant has grey skin.

    Truth
        An after-the-fact kind of
        justification, you can say an
        objective true statement about your
        belief. Example: you saw an elephant,
        and you saw it actually has grey skin,
        so you can say objectively "elephant
        has grey skin".

    with and evident in his actions."

parenthetical statement
    A parenthetical statement is one that

    Have you ever said something like "I'm
    hungry!" and then added "...but I only
    want French fries"? That second statement
    is parenthetical: it clarifies the first
    statement.

    Just like words in parentheses (like these
    words) add clarity to a sentence,
    parenthetical words in speech help make
    something clearer or give extra
    information.

    support those ideas.

miasma theory
    The miasma theory is an obsolete medical
    theory that held that diseases—such as

    Death—were caused by a miasma, a noxious

    air.

    The theory held that epidemics were caused
    by miasma, emanating from rotting organic
    matter.

miasma
    [Greek mythology]

    In Greek mythology, a miasma is "a
    contagious power ... that has an
    independent life of its own.

    Until purged by the sacrificial death of
    the wrongdoer, society would be
    chronically infected by catastrophe." An
    example is Atreus who invited his brother
    Thyestes to a delicious stew containing
    the bodies of his own sons.

    A miasma contaminated the entire family of
    Atreus, where one violent crime led to
    another, providing fodder for many of the

    of reinforcing it.
