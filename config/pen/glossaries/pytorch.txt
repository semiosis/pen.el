    Preparing your data for training with
    DataLoaders The Dataset retrieves our
    dataset’s features and labels one sample
    at a time. While training a model, we
    typically want to pass samples in
    “minibatches”, reshuffle the data at every
    epoch to reduce model overfitting, and use
    Python’s multiprocessing to speed up data
    retrieval.

    DataLoader is an iterable that abstracts
    this complexity for us in an easy API.

        from torch.utils.data import DataLoader

        train_dataloader = DataLoader(training_data, batch_size=64, shuffle=True)
        test_dataloader = DataLoader(test_data, batch_size=64, shuffle=True)
