    leave their post for any cause, save at
    the command of their lord.

Eru
Eru Ilúvatar
    The supreme deity of Arda.
    
    He was the single creator, above the
    Valar, but delegated almost all direct
    action within Eä to the Ainur, including
    the shaping of the world.
    
    Transcendent, completely outside of and
    beyond the world.
    
    He first created a group of angelic
    beings, called in Elvish the "Ainur," and
    these holy spirits were co-actors in the
    creation of Arda through a holy music and
    chanting called the "Music of the Ainur."
    
    He is known also as "the All-Powerful",
    and he alone could create independent

    Originally the most powerful of the Ainur
    created by Eru Ilúvatar, Melkor rebelled
    against his creator out of pride and
    sought to corrupt Arda.
    
    After committing many evils in the First
    Age, such as the theft of the Silmarils,
    which resulted in his name Morgoth, and
    the destruction of the Two Lamps and the
    Two Trees of Valinor, Morgoth was defeated
    by the Host of Valinor in the War of
    Wrath.
    
    As punishment he was cast out of Arda into
    the Void, though it was prophesied he
    would one day return.
    
    Melkor was created by Eru Ilúvatar in the
    Timeless Halls at the beginning of
    creation.
    
    His brother was Manwë, though Melkor was
    greater in power and knowledge than any of
    the Ainur.

    prominently the members of the House of
    Finarfin). 
    
    The Ñoldor are accounted as the greatest
    of the Elves in lore and smithcraft.
    
    Fëanor (son of Finwë by Míriel) was the
    greatest of their craftsmen, and their
    second and briefest-reigning High King.
    
Fëanor
    When Melkor killed Finwë and stole the
    Silmarils, Fëanor renamed Melkor Morgoth
    ("Black Enemy"), and persuaded the Ñoldor
    to pursue him to Middle-earth and wage
    against him what became the War of the
    Jewels.

    horses of Middle-earth.
    
    Shadowfax was capable of comprehending
    human speech and was said to run faster
    than the wind.
    
    Originally belonging to the House of Eorl,
    Lord of Rohan, Shadowfax was too wild to
    be tamed by the Rohirrim.
    
    Eventually, Théoden, the 17th king of
    Rohan, gave him to the wizard Gandalf the
    White.

    grey in daylight, and hardly visible at
    night.
