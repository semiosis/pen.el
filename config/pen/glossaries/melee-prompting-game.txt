Exquisite Corpse
    A game in which each participant takes
    turns writing or drawing on a sheet of
    paper, folds it to conceal his or her
    contribution, then passes it to the next
    player for a further contribution.

    The game gained popularity in artistic
    circles during the 1920s, when it was
    adopted as a technique by artists of the
    Surrealist movement.
