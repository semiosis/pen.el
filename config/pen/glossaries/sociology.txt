cancel culture
call-out culture
    A contemporary phrase used to refer to a
    form of ostracism in which someone is
    thrust out of social or professional
    circles â€“ whether it be online, on social
    media, or in person.
    
    Those subject to this ostracism are said
    to have been "cancelled".

Critical theory
    Any approach to social philosophy that
    focuses on reflective assessment and
    critique of society and culture in order
    to reveal and challenge power structures.
    
    With roots in sociology and literary
    criticism, it argues that social problems
    stem more from social structures and
    cultural assumptions than from
    individuals.
    
    It argues that ideology is the principal
    obstacle to human liberation.
    
    When critical theory was first introduced,
    it was considered a form of social
    science, but recently some have argued
    that it should fall under a different
    category.

Critical Theory
    [sociological theory]

    (capitalized)

    Refers specifically to a school of thought
    practiced by the Frankfurt School
    theoreticians Herbert Marcuse, Theodor
    Adorno, Walter Benjamin, Erich Fromm, and
    Max Horkheimer.
    
    Horkheimer described a theory as critical
    insofar as it seeks "to liberate human
    beings from the circumstances that enslave
    them." Although a product of modernism,
    and although many of the progenitors of
    critical theory were skeptical of
    postmodernism, critical theory is one of
    the major components of both modern and
    postmodern thought, and is widely applied
    in the humanities and social sciences
    today.
