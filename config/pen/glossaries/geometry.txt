congruent
    In agreement or harmony.
    "the rules may not be congruent with the
    requirements of the law"

incongruent
    Incongruous; incompatible.

    [#chemistry]
    (of melting, dissolution, or other
    process) affecting the components of an
    alloy or other substance differently.

prismatic
    Of, relating to, or like a prism.

    Formed by or as if by a transparent prism.

torus
    A surface of revolution generated by
    revolving a circle in three-dimensional
    space about an axis that is coplanar with
    the circle.
    
    If the axis of revolution does not touch
    the circle, the surface has a ring shape
    and is called a torus of revolution.

prismatic torus
    A torus that is prismatic.

    It looks cool.

affine geometry
    What remains of Euclidean geometry when
    ignoring (mathematicians often say
    "forgetting") the metric notions of
    distance and angle.

    As the notion of parallel lines is one of
    the main properties that is independent of
    any metric, affine geometry is often
    considered as the study of parallel lines.
    
    Therefore, Playfair's axiom (Given a line
    L and a point P not on L, there is exactly
    one line parallel to L that passes through
    P.) is fundamental in affine geometry.
    
    Comparisons of figures in affine geometry
    are made with affine transformations,
    which are mappings that preserve alignment
    of points and parallelism of lines.

rational polygon
    A polygon is called rational if the angle
    between each pair of sides is a rational
    multiple of Ï€.

inversive geometry
    The study of those properties of figures
    that are preserved by a generalization of
    a type of transformation of the Euclidean
    plane, called inversion.
    
    These transformations preserve angles and
    map generalized circles into generalized
    circles, where a generalized circle means
    either a circle or a line (loosely
    speaking, a circle with infinite radius).
    
    Many difficult problems in geometry become
    much more tractable when an inversion is
    applied.
    
    The concept of inversion can be
    generalized to higher-dimensional spaces.

Heesch number
    A measure of the maximum number of times
    you can surround the shape with layers of
    copies of itself.

catenary
catenary curve
    [#physics]
    [#geometry]

    The curve that an idealized hanging chain
    or cable assumes under its own weight when
    supported only at its ends.
    
    The catenary curve has a U-like shape,
    superficially similar in appearance to a
    parabolic arch, but it is not a parabola. 

minimal surface
    A surface that locally minimizes its area.
    
    This is equivalent to having zero mean
    curvature (see definitions below).
    
    The term "minimal surface" is used because
    these surfaces originally arose as
    surfaces that minimized total surface area
    subject to some constraint.

catenoid
    A type of surface, arising by rotating a
    catenary curve about an axis.
    
    It is a minimal surface, meaning that it
    occupies the least area when bounded by a
    closed space.
    
    It was formally described in 1744 by the
    mathematician Leonhard Euler.

centroid
    The geometric center.
