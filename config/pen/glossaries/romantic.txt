soul song
    The soul song is wordless and unique and
    expresses the pure unbridled emotion from
    the soul that cannot be expressed by
    words.

    A person's soul song is a song that
    they've never heard before, but when it
    comes on the radio (or is played in some
    other manner) they immediately know all
    the words.
