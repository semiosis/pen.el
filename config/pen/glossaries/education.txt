Bloom's taxonomy
    A set of three hierarchical models used to
    classify educational learning objectives
    into levels of complexity and specificity.

    The three lists cover the learning
    objectives in cognitive, affective and
    sensory domains.

    The cognitive domain (knowledge-based)
        Knowledge
        Comprehension
        Application
        Analysis
        Synthesis
        Evaluation

    The affective domain (emotion-based)
        Receiving
        Responding
        Valuing
        Organizing
        Characterizing

    The psychomotor domain (action-based)
        Perception
        Set
        Guided response
        Mechanism
        Complex overt response
        Adaptation
        Origination
