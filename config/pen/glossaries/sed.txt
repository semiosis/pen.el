Hold space
Hold buffer
    Long-term storage.
    
    You can catch something, store it and
    reuse it later when sed is processing
    another line.

    You do not directly operate on the hold
    space. Instead, you copy it or append to
    the pattern space if you want to do
    something with it.

Pattern space
Pattern buffer
    The line that has been currently read from
    the file.

    Analogy: The operations table.

    The scratchpad where the current
    information is stored.

    'p' is used to print the pattern
    space, but it cannot be used to print the
    hold space.

    Likewise, 's' can be used on the pattern
    space only.
