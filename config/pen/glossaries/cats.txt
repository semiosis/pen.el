Psychogenic alopecia
    A stress-related disorder.
    
    It is an obsessive-compulsive behavior
    where the cats suddenly cannot stop
    licking or chewing at themselves.
    
    Since grooming releases endorphins
    (hormones that make the cat happy), they
    will often partake in this pleasurable and
    relaxing ritual to help calm themselves.
