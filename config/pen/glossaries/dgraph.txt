GraphQL+-
    Dgraph’s "GraphQL+-" is based on
    Facebook’s GraphQL. GraphQL wasn’t
    developed for Graph databases, but its
    graph-like query syntax, schema validation
    and subgraph shaped response make it a
    great language choice. 

Cypher
    Most widely adopted graph database query
    language.
    
    Example:
        MATCH (d:Database)-[:USES]->(Cypher)-[:QUERIES]->(:Model:Graph)
        WHERE d.name IN ['SAP HANA Graph','Redis','AgensGraph', 'Neo4j',...]
        RETURN Cypher.features
