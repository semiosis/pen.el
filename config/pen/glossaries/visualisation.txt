flame graph

    A visualization of profiled software,
    allowing the most frequent code-paths to
    be identified quickly and accurately.
    
    They can be generated using my open source
    programs on
    github.com/brendangregg/FlameGraph, which
    create interactive SVGs.
    
    See the Updates section for other
    implementations.
    
    Recently I've been helping with d3-flame-
    graph.

    Summary:
        The x-axis shows the stack profile
        population, sorted alphabetically (it
        is not the passage of time), and the
        y-axis shows stack depth, counting
        from zero at the bottom.
        
        Each rectangle represents a stack
        frame.
        
        The wider a frame is is, the more
        often it was present in the stacks.
        
        The top edge shows what is on-CPU, and
        beneath it is its ancestry.
        
        The colors are usually not
        significant, picked randomly to
        differentiate frames.

    Examples:
    - CPU
    - Memory
    - Off-CPU
    - Hot/Cold
    - Differential
