service mesh
    Example: the open source project Istio.

    A way to control how different parts of an
    application share data with one another.
    
    Unlike other systems for managing this
    communication, a service mesh is a
    dedicated infrastructure layer built right
    into an app.

mesh networking
meshnet
mesh network
    A local network topology in which the
    infrastructure nodes connect directly,
    dynamically and non-hierarchically to as
    many other nodes as possible and cooperate
    with one another to efficiently route data
    from/to clients.

fully connected mesh network
fully meshed
partially connected mesh network
partially meshed
    A "fully meshed" network means that every
    node has a direct connection to every
    other node, which is an elaborate and
    expensive architecture.
    
    Most mesh networks are partially meshed
    and require traversing intermediate nodes
    to go from each node to every other.

    A fully connected mesh network is where
    each node is connected to every other node
    in the network.
