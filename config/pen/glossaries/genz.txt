glow up
    An informal term for a positive personal

    style and often also growth in confidence
    and maturity (and sometimes aspects of
    personal or professional life).

    The term is especially applied to teens
    and young adults, often as a way to point
    out how they have "grown into themselves,"
    perhaps after an "awkward phase."
