The Four Worlds
Four Worlds
Olamot
Olam
    Sometimes counted with a prior stage to
    make Five Worlds, are the comprehensive
    categories of spiritual realms in Kabbalah
    in the descending chain of Existence.
    
    The concept of "Worlds" denotes the
    emanation of creative lifeforce from the
    Ein Sof Divine Infinite, through
    progressive, innumerable tzimtzumim
    (concealments/veilings/condensations).
    
    As particular sefirot dominate in each
    realm, so the primordial fifth World, Adam
    Kadmon, is often excluded for its
    transcendence, and the four subsequent
    Worlds are usually referred to.
    
    Their names are read out from Isaiah 43:7,
    "Every one that is called by My name and
    for My glory, I have created, I have
    formed, even I have made" each elucidating
    the names Atziluth ("Emanation/Close"),
    Beriah ("Creation"), Yetzirah
    ("Formation"), and Asiyah ("Action").
    
    Below Asiyah, the lowest spiritual World,
    is Asiyah-Gashmi ("Physical Asiyah"), our
    Physical Universe, which enclothes its
    last two sefirot “emanations” (Yesod and
    Malkuth).
    
    Collectively, the Four Worlds are also
    referred to as ABiYA, after their initial
    letters.
    
    As well as the functional role each World
    has in the process of Creation, they also
    embody dimensions of consciousness within
    human experience.

Kabbalah
Jewish Kabbalah
    An esoteric method, discipline and school
    of thought in Jewish mysticism.
    
    A traditional Kabbalist in Judaism is
    called a Mekubbal (מְקוּבָּל‎ Məqūbbāl).
    
    The definition of Kabbalah varies
    according to the tradition and aims of
    those following it, from its origin in
    medieval Judaism to its later adaptations
    in Western esotericism (Christian Kabbalah
    and Hermetic Qabalah).
    
    Jewish Kabbalah is a set of esoteric
    teachings meant to explain the
    relationship between the unchanging,
    eternal God—the mysterious Ein Sof (אֵין
    סוֹף‎, "The Infinite")—and the mortal,
    finite universe (God's creation).
    
    It forms the foundation of mystical
    religious interpretations within Judaism.

Christian Kabbalah
    Arose during the Renaissance due to
    Christian scholars' interest in the
    mysticism of Jewish Kabbalah, which they
    interpreted according to Christian
    theology.
    
    It is often transliterated as Cabala (also
    Cabbala) to distinguish it from the Jewish
    form and from Hermetic Qabalah.

Hermetic Qabalah
    A Western esoteric tradition involving
    mysticism and the occult.
    
    It is the underlying philosophy and
    framework for magical societies such as
    the Golden Dawn, Thelemic orders,
    mystical-religious societies such as the
    Builders of the Adytum and the Fellowship
    of the Rosy Cross, and is a precursor to
    the Neopagan, Wiccan and New Age
    movements.
    
    The Hermetic Qabalah is the basis for
    Qliphothic Qabala as studied by left hand
    path orders, such as the Typhonian Order.

Adam Kadmon
Primordial Man
Adam Elyon
Most High Man
Adam Ila'ah
Supreme Man
    [#Kabbalah]

    The first of Four Worlds that came into
    being after the contraction of God's
    infinite light.
    
    Adam Kadmon is not the same as the
    physical Adam Ha-Rishon.

    In Lurianic Kabbalah, the description of
    Adam Kadmon is anthropomorphic.
    
    Nonetheless, Adam Kadmon is divine light
    without vessels, i.e., pure potential.
    
    In the human psyche, Adam Kadmon
    corresponds to the yechidah, the
    collective essence of the soul.

sefirot
emanations
    The 10 attributes/emanations in Kabbalah,
    through which Ein Sof reveals itself and
    continuously creates both the physical
    realm and the chain of higher metaphysical
    realms.
    
    The term is alternatively transliterated
    into English as sephirot/sephiroth,
    singular sefirah/sephirah, etc.
