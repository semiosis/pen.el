Sectarianism
    A political or cultural conflict between
    two groups which are often related to the
    form of government which they live under.
    
    Prejudice, discrimination, or hatred can
    arise in these conflicts, depending on the
    political status quo and if one group
    holds more power within the government.
    
    Often, not all members of these groups are
    engaged in the conflict.

hate speech
    Abusive or threatening speech or writing
    that expresses prejudice against a
    particular group, especially on the basis
    of race, religion, or sexual orientation.

    "we don't tolerate any form of hate
    speech"

xenophobia
    The fear or hatred of that which is
    perceived to be foreign or strange.
    
    It is an expression of perceived conflict
    between an ingroup and an outgroup and may
    manifest in suspicion by the one of the
    other's activities, a desire to eliminate
    their presence, and fear of losing
    national, ethnic or racial identity.

discrimination
    The unjust or prejudicial treatment of
    different categories of people, especially
    on the grounds of race, age, or sex.

prejudice
    Preconceived opinion that is not based on
    reason or actual experience.

    "prejudice against people from different
    backgrounds"

bigot
    A person who is intolerant toward those
    holding different opinions.

    Mostly, the person's opinions are based on
    prejudice.

    Obstinate or unreasonable attachment to a
    belief, opinion, or faction; in
    particular, prejudice against a person or
    people on the basis of their membership of
    a particular group.

    "the difficulties of combating prejudice
    and bigotry"

neurodiversity
    Broadly defined as an approach to learning
    and disability that suggests diverse
    neurological conditions appear as a result
    of normal variations in the human genome.

mentalism
sanism
    Discrimination and oppression against a
    mental trait or condition a person has, or
    is judged to have.
    
    This discrimination may or may not be
    characterized in terms of mental disorder
    or cognitive impairment.
    
    The discrimination is based on numerous
    factors such as stereotypes about
    neurodivergence, for example autism,
    learning disorders, ADHD, bipolar,
    schizophrenia, and personality disorders,
    specific behavioral phenomena such as
    stuttering and tics, or intellectual
    disability.

stigma
social stigma
    An attribute, behavior, or reputation
    which is socially discrediting in a
    particular way: it causes an individual to
    be mentally classified by others in an
    undesirable, rejected stereotype rather
    than in an accepted, normal one.

    The disapproval of, or discrimination
    against, an individual or group based on
    perceivable social characteristics that
    serve to distinguish them from other
    members of a society.

    Social stigmas are commonly related to:
    - culture,
    - gender,
    - race,
    - socioeconomic class,
    - age,
    - sexual orientation,
    - body image,
    - intelligence or lack thereof, and
    - health.

    Stigma can also be against oneself. See
    "self-stigma".

content choice
    [#stigma communication]

    Types:
    - marks,
    - labels,
    - peril, and
    - responsibility

peril
    Whether the condition will physically,
    socially, or morally contaminate others.

responsibility
    The Disability Rights Movement recognises
    that while there is considerable stigma
    towards people with physical disabilities,
    the negative social stigma surrounding
    mental illness is significantly worse,
    with those suffering being perceived to
    have control of their disabilities and
    being responsible for causing them.

stigma communication
    Involved in creating, maintaining, and
    diffusing stigmas, and enacting
    stigmatization.
    
    The model of stigma communication explains
    how and why particular content choices can
    create stigmas and encourage their
    diffusion.
    
    Content choices indeed predicted stigma
    beliefs, intentions to further diffuse
    these messages, and agreement with
    regulating infected persons' behaviors.

folkways
    The traditional behaviour or way of life
    of a particular community or group of
    people.
    "a study of Cherokee folklore and
    folkways"

mores
    The essential or characteristic customs
    and conventions of a society or community.
    "an offence against social mores"

deviance
the sociology of deviance
    Explores the actions and/or behaviors that
    violate social norms across formally
    enacted rules (e.g., crime) as well as
    informal violations of social norms (e.g.,
    rejecting folkways and mores).
    
    Although deviance may have a negative
    connotation, the violation of social norms
    is not always a negative action; positive
    deviation exists in some situations.
    
    Although a norm is violated, a behavior
    can still be classified as positive or
    acceptable.
    
    Social norms differ throughout society and
    between cultures.
    
    A certain act or behaviour may be viewed
    as deviant and receive sanctions or
    punishments within one society and be seen
    as a normal behaviour in another society.
    
    Additionally, as a society's understanding
    of social norms changes over time, so too
    does the collective perception of
    deviance.

metastereotype
meta-stereotype
    [#social psychology]

    A stereotype that members of one group
    have about the way in which they are
    stereotypically viewed by members of
    another group.
    
    In other words, it is a stereotype about a
    stereotype.

self-stigma
spoiled identity
    Stigma can be against oneself, stemming
    from a negatively viewed personal
    attribute that results in a 'spoiled
    identity" (i.e., self-stigma.).

    The meaning the stigma disqualifies the
    stigmatized individual from full social
    acceptance before audiences of normals.

    Stigma is not a fixed or inherent
    attribute of a person, but rather as the
    experience and meaning of difference.
    
divergent
deviance
deviant
    Stigma occurs when an individual is
    identified as deviant, linked with
    negative stereotypes that engender
    prejudiced attitudes, which are acted upon
    in discriminatory behavior.
    
    Those deviate from the expectations of a
    group.

    Two types:
    - societal deviance
    - situational deviance

societal deviance
    Refers to a condition widely perceived, in
    advance and in general, as being deviant
    and hence stigma and stigmatized.
    
    "Homosexuality is, therefore, an example
    of societal deviance because there is such
    a high degree of consensus to the effect
    that homosexuality is different, and a
    violation of norms or social expectation".
    
situational deviance
    Refers to a deviant act that is labeled as
    deviant in a specific situation, and may
    not be labeled deviant by society.
    
    Similarly, a socially deviant action might
    not be considered deviant in specific
    situations.
    
    "A robber or other street criminal is an
    excellent example. It is the crime which
    leads to the stigma and stigmatization of
    the person so affected."

    The physically disabled, mentally ill,
    homosexuals, and a host of others who is
    labeled deviant because they deviate from
    the expectations of a group, are subject
    to stigmatization.

stigmatization
    The social rejection of numerous
    individuals, and often entire groups of
    people who have been labeled deviant.

stigmatize
stigmatized
    Describe or regard as worthy of disgrace
    or great disapproval.
    "the institution was stigmatized as a last
    resort for the destitute"

    "Francis, stigmatized in fashion as his
    Lord"
