aloha
    The Hawaiian word for love, affection,
    peace, compassion and mercy, that is
    commonly used as a simple greeting but has
    a deeper cultural and spiritual
    significance to native Hawaiians, for whom
    the term is used to define a force that
    holds together existence.
    
    The word is found in all Polynesian
    languages and always with the same basic
    meaning of "love, compassion, sympathy,
    kindness", although the use in Hawaii has
    a seriousness lacking in the Tahitian and
    Samoan meanings.
    
    Mary Kawena Pukui wrote that the "first
    expression" of aloha was between a parent
    and child.
    
    The Oxford English Dictionary defined the
    word as a greeting like "welcome" and
    "farewell", using a number of examples
    dating back as far as 1798 and up to 1978
    where it was defined as a substitute for
    "welcome".
    
    Lorrin Andrews wrote the first Hawaiian
    dictionary, called A Dictionary of the
    Hawaiian Language.
    
    In it, he describes aloha as "A word
    expressing different feelings: love,
    affection, gratitude, kindness, pity,
    compassion, grief, the modern common
    salutation at meeting; parting".
    
    Mary Kawena Pukui and Samuel Hoyt Elbert's
    Hawaiian Dictionary: Hawaiian-English,
    English-Hawaiian also contains a similar
    definition.
    
    Anthropologist Francis Newton states that
    "Aloha is a complex and profound
    sentiment.
    
    Such emotions defy definition".
    
    Anna Wierzbicka concludes that the term
    has "no equivalent in English".

    The Hawaiian words for rainbows describe
    different manifestations of rainbows that
    are possible.
    
    There are words for Earth-clinging
    rainbows (uakoko), standing rainbow shafts
    (khili), barely visible rainbows
    (punakea), and moonbows (nuenue kau pM),
    among others.
    
    In Hawaiian mythology the rainbow is a
    symbol of transformation and a pathway
    between Earth and Heaven, as it is in many
    cultures around the world, says Businger
    in a press release.
