Nash equilibrium
    A Nash equilibrium is a set of strategies,
    one for each player, such that no player
    has incentive to change his or her
    strategy given what the other players are
    doing.

Combinatorial Game Theory
    Studies strategies and mathematics of two-
    player games of perfect knowledge such as
    chess or go (but often either
    concentrating instead on simpler games
    such as nim, or solving endgames and other
    special cases).

    A branch of mathematics and theoretical CS
    that typically studies sequential games
    with perfect information.
