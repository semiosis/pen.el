dividend
    A distribution of profits by a corporation
    to its shareholders.
    
    When a corporation earns a profit or
    surplus, it is able to pay a proportion of
    the profit as a dividend to shareholders.
    
    Any amount not distributed is taken to be
    re-invested in the business (called
    retained earnings).
