Rasa X
    A tool to learn from real conversations
    and improve your assistant.
    
    Using it is totally optional.
    
    If you don’t want to, you can just use
    Rasa on its own.

Entities

    Examples:
        wit/datetime
            Captures and resolves date and
            time, like tomorrow at 6pm.

            Supported by Duckling.

context
    [#contextual assistants]

    https://blog.rasa.com/level-3-contextual-assistants-beyond-answering-simple-questions/

    Key capabilities:
    - User Profile:
      Example:
      - age,
      - name,
      - address, or
      - which insurance policy they purchased.

    - User Goal:
      Usually the starting point of a
      conversation.

      Example:
      - a specific problem.

      All user goals are intents.
      
      Not all intents are user goals (e.g.
      yes/no is not a user goal)

    - Conversation History:
      What has been said before contains a lot
      of important contextual data, especially
      to clarify what the user meant.
      
      For example, a pronoun like “it” might
      refer to a noun before like “MacBook”
      (coreference).

    - User Response:
      A user’s response can be directly
      connected to the context it was asked in.
      
      For example, a “yes” answer in itself
      doesn’t mean much but needs to be
      connected to a specific question before.

    - World Knowledge:
      This is a tricky one as it is very broad.
      
      It could be anything from knowing the
      location of the user so that "downtown"
      means "Manhattan" if the user is in New
      York or "rangers" means "New York Rangers"
      because the conversation is about ice
      hockey.
      
      It could also include data from sensors or
      feeds (e.g. the prevailing weather or fuel
      level in a car)
