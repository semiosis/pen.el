UTM
The UTM system
    Divides the Earth into 60 zones, each 6°
    of longitude in width.
    
    Zone 1 covers longitude 180° to 174° W;
    
    zone numbering increases eastward to zone
    60, which covers longitude 174°E to 180°.
    
    The polar regions south of 80°S and north
    of 84°N are excluded.

    As opposed to MGRS.

False northing
    A linear value applied to the origin of
    the y coordinates.
    
    False easting and northing values are
    usually applied to ensure that all x and y
    values are positive.
    
    You can also use the false easting and
    northing parameters to reduce the range of
    the x or y coordinate values.

MGRS
The Military Grid Reference System
    The geocoordinate standard used by NATO
    militaries for locating points on Earth.
    
    The MGRS is derived from the Universal
    Transverse Mercator (UTM) grid system and
    the Universal Polar Stereographic (UPS)
    grid system, but uses a different labeling
    convention.
