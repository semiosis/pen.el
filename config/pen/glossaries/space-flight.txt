Delta-V
Δv
    Commonplace notation used in mathematics
    and particularly in physics to denote a
    change or difference in velocity.
    
    In the context of a motor vehicle crash,
    Δv specifically refers to the change in
    velocity between pre-collision and post-
    collision trajectories of a vehicle.

Kármán line
    Represents both the attempt to define a
    boundary between Earth's atmosphere and
    outer space, and offers a specific
    definition set by the Fédération
    aéronautique internationale, an
    international record-keeping body for
    aeronautics

low Earth orbit
LEO
    An orbit that is relatively close to
    Earth's surface.
    
    It is normally at an altitude of less than
    1000 km but could be as low as 160 km
    above Earth – which is low compared to
    other orbits, but still very far above
    Earth's surface.

Kessler Syndrome
    A theoretical scenario in which the
    density of objects in LEO due to space
    pollution is high enough that collisions
    between objects could cause a cascade in
    which each collision generates space
    debris that increases the likelihood of
    further collisions.

paraterraforming
    Creation of an Earthlike environment on
    the Mars surface that could include not
    only farms but also parks, forests, and
    lakes, all enclosed to maintain adequate
    air pressure.

VTOL
vertical take-off and landing
    As the name suggests, refers to aircraft
    that can take off, hover, and land
    vertically.

max q
    [condition]
    [event]

    The max q condition is the point when an
    aerospace vehicle's atmospheric flight
    reaches maximum dynamic pressure.
