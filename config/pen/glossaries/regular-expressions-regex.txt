grex
    Automatically generating a single regular
    expression from user-provided test cases.
    
    The resulting expression is guaranteed to
    match the test cases which it was
    generated from.


possessive [quantifier]
    Like a greedy quantifier, a possessive
    quantifier repeats the token as many times
    as possible. Unlike a greedy quantifier,
    it does not give up matches as the engine
    backtracks. With a possessive quantifier,
    the deal is all or nothing.

    Used for performance.
    Greedy parts of the regex backtrack to
    match fewer characters when another part
    of the regex fails, in case it was too
    greedy. A posessive, greedy qualifier will
    not give up what it has matched, so it
    will fail faster.
