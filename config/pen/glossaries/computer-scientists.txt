Babbage
    [computer scientist]

    An English polymath.
    
    A mathematician, philosopher, inventor and
    mechanical engineer, Babbage originated
    the concept of a digital programmable
    computer.
    
    Babbage is considered by some to be
    "father of the computer".
    
    Babbage is credited with inventing the
    first mechanical computer, the Difference
    Engine, that eventually led to more
    complex electronic designs, though all the
    essential ideas of modern computers are to
    be found in Babbage's Analytical Engine,
    programmed using a principle openly
    borrowed from the Jacquard loom.
    
    Babbage had a broad range of interests in
    addition to his work on computers covered
    in his book Economy of Manufactures and
    Machinery.
    
    His varied work in other fields has led
    him to be described as "pre-eminent" among
    the many polymaths of his century.

    Babbage wrote a whole chapter on the topic
    of religion, where he identified three
    sources of divine knowledge:
    - A priori or mystical experience
    - From Revelation
    - From the examination of the works of the
      Creator

Difference Engine
    An automatic mechanical calculator
    designed to tabulate polynomial functions.
    
    It was designed in the 1820s, and was
    first created by Charles Babbage.
