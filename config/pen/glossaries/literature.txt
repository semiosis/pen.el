scholia
    Grammatical, critical, or explanatory
    comments - original or copied from prior
    commentaries - which are inserted in the
    margin of the manuscript of ancient
    authors, as glosses.

    One who writes scholia is a scholiast.

    The earliest attested use of the word
    dates to the 1st century BC.

mythopoeia
mythopoesis
    A narrative genre in modern literature and
    film where a fictional or artificial
    mythology is created by the writer of
    prose or other fiction.
    
    This meaning of the word follows its use
    by J.R.R. Tolkien in the 1930s.

magic realism
magical realism
marvelous realism
    A 20th-century style of fiction and
    literary genre.
    
    The terms were influenced by an eponymous
    German painting style in the 1920s.
    
    As a literary fiction style, magic realism
    paints a realistic view of the modern
    world while also adding magical elements,
    often dealing with the blurring of the
    lines between fantasy and reality.
    
    Magical realism, perhaps the most common
    term, often refers to literature in
    particular, with magical or supernatural
    phenomena presented in an otherwise real-
    world or mundane setting, commonly found
    in novels and dramatic performances.: 1–5 
    Despite including certain magic elements,
    it is generally considered to be a
    different genre from fantasy because
    magical realism uses a substantial amount
    of realistic detail and employs magical
    elements to make a point about reality,
    while fantasy stories are often separated
    from reality.
    
    Magical realism is often seen as an
    amalgamation of real and magical elements
    that produces a more inclusive writing
    form than either literary realism or
    fantasy.

Exegesis
    [Literary genre]

    A critical explanation or interpretation
    of a text.
    
    Traditionally, the term was used primarily
    for work with religious texts, especially
    the Bible.

literary nonsense
nonsense literature
    A broad categorization of literature that
    balances elements that make sense with
    some that do not, with the effect of
    subverting language conventions or logical
    reasoning.
    
    Even though the most well-known form of
    literary nonsense is nonsense verse, the
    genre is present in many forms of
    literature.
    
    The effect of nonsense is often caused by
    an excess of meaning, rather than a lack
    of it.
    
    Its humor is derived from its nonsensical
    nature, rather than wit or the "joke" of a
    punchline.

tawdry
    Showy but cheap and of poor quality.

verbal irony
    sarcasm
        "Great idea!", "I hear they do fine
        work."

    hyperbole
        "That's the best idea I have heard in
        years!"

    understatement
        "Sure, what the hell, it's only
        cancer..."

    rhetorical questions
        "What, does your spirit have cancer?"

    double entendre
        "I'll bet if you do that, you'll be
        communing with spirits in no time..."

    jocularity
        "Get them to fix your bad back while
        you're at it."

innuendo
    A form of wordplay.

    Saying one thing and meaning another.
    
    Innuendo only works when both parties
    understand the intended meaning.

    Example:
    - Woman 1: Do you know Arthur?
    - Woman 2: Oh yes, I know him very well.

    The intended meaning, of course, is that
    Woman 2 and ‘Arthur’ are intimately
    familiar.

double entendre
    A form of wordplay.
    
    It relies on an ambiguity in the phrasing
    or use of words in a statement.
    
    It is when a statement can be ‘read two
    ways’ (or three ways for a triple
    entendre).
    
    Typically the joke works because one
    reading is perfectly innocuous, whilst the
    second is rude, tawdry or sexual.

    Double Entendres have been a staple of
    comedy from music hall to vaudeville and a
    lot of 20th century English comedy,
    notably the Carry On films.

    Example:
    - New school head checks scaled back

    The first (intended) meaning is that
    checks for new school headteachers are to
    be reduced.

    The second (tawdry) is that the new school
    headteacher checks his scaled back,
    indicating he may be a reptile.

pun
    A form of wordplay.
    
    A pun exploits a word with two meanings,
    or two similar-sounding words for comedic
    effect.
    
    Puns may well be the oldest form of joke.

    Examples:
    “I have a dentist’s appointment at
    tooth-hurty (two-thirty)”.

    A fish and chip shop called ‘The
    Codfather’.

    Setup: “Why did the apple turn over?”
    Punchline: “Because it saw the swiss roll!
    This one’s a double pun because both apple
    turnover and swiss roll are types of
    dessert.

euphemism
    A form of wordplay.

    Substituting one word or expression for
    another whilst still preserving the
    meaning.
    
    This is done in order to render ‘polite’ a
    subject that is potentially offensive,
    frightening or upsetting.

    Examples:
    - ‘Passed away’ for died
    - ‘Making love’ for having sex
    - ‘Gardening leave’ for suspension from
      work.

syntaxis
    A style in writing or in rhetoric that
    favors complex syntax, in contrast to the
    simple sentence structures of parataxis.
    
    For example, 19th-century German academic
    prose, and John Milton's Paradise Lost
    poetry in English are notably syntactic.
    
    Syntaxis, depending on the author, may
    also contrast with or include hypotaxis.

parataxis
    [literary technique]

    Favors short, simple sentences, without
    conjunctions or with the use of
    coordinating, but not with subordinating
    conjunctions.

    It contrasts with syntaxis and hypotaxis.

    Can most simply be described as and
    compared to the way children speak.
    
    They speak their ideas as they come to
    them, one after the other, without
    logically connecting the ideas together.
    
    Parataxis may use commas, semi-colons, and
    periods to force juxtaposition, but it can
    also replace these punctuation marks with
    "and" to seamlessly string the speech or
    written piece together and present the
    words as each being equally important.
    
    Works utilizing parataxis as a style may
    emit a staccato rhythm.
    
    This can result in phrases with words that
    don't seem to go together at all.
    
    An example of this is Julius Caesar's
    phrase "Veni, vidi, vici" or, "I came, I
    saw, I conquered".
    
    Parataxis can also be a pile of fast-
    moving ideas with a lack of or insistent
    rhythm.
    
    An example of this form of parataxis comes
    from the Bible.
    
    It says, "And God said, "Let there be
    light," and there was light."

hypotaxis
    The grammatical arrangement of
    functionally similar but "unequal"
    constructs; certain constructs have more
    importance than others inside a sentence.
    
    A common example of syntactic expression
    of hypotaxis is the subordination of one
    syntactic unit to another in a complex
    sentence.

    Hypotaxis is a formal way of saying that a
    sentence contains subordinate clauses or
    phrases that merely build on and add to
    the main clause.
    
    In a complex sentence, there is one main
    clause, and one or more subordinate
    clauses.
    
    These clauses are not independent.

    Instead, they provide additional
    information that clarifies the main clause
    of the sentence.
    
    Examples of Hypotaxis:
    - Sarah was awarded first prize
      - after she wowed the audience with her
        singing.
    - Everything is going to be alright
      - because mother said so.
    - Mrs. Taylor is my English teacher
      - who lets us write about fairy tales
        and reads to us from fascinating
        books.

conceit
sustained metaphor
extended metaphor
    [#modern literary criticism]
    [#genre fiction]
    [extended rhetorical device]

    An author’s exploitation of a single
    metaphor or analogy at length through
    multiple linked tenors, vehicles, and
    grounds throughout a poem or story.

    An extended rhetorical device, summed up
    in a short phrase, that refers to a
    situation which either does not exist, or
    exists rarely, but is needed for the plot.

    Examples:
    - "faster than light travel"
    - "superior alien science"
    - "hardboiled private gumshoe"

    The word conceit was originally coined in
    the context of poetry, deriving from the
    root concept, conceive.
    
    It has subsequently been extended to other
    forms of literature, the performing arts,
    painting, photography, and even
    architecture.

    An ingenious or fanciful comparison or
    metaphor.
    "the idea of the wind's singing is a prime
    romantic conceit"

pentalogy
    (from Greek πεντα- penta-, "five" and
    -λογία -logia, "discourse")

    A compound literary or narrative work that
    is explicitly divided into five parts.
    
    Although modern use of the word implies
    both that the parts are reasonably self-
    contained and that the structure was
    intended by the author, historically,
    neither was necessarily true: in fact, a
    pentalogia could be assembled by a later
    editor, just as Plotinus's Enneads were
    arranged in nines by Porphyry in order to
    create an overarching structure of six
    which would express the idea of
    perfection.
