    Serve where the tennis ball lands inside
    the service box and is not touched by the
    receiver; thus, a shot that is both a
    serve and a winner is an ace.
    
    Aces are usually powerful and generally
    land on or near one of the corners at the
    back of the service box.
    
    Initially, the term was used to indicate
    the scoring of a point.

ad out
    Advantage to the receiver.

    French Open remains the only major tennis
    event to use all advantage sets.

    (until 2015), Fed Cup (until 2015),

    (similar to the driver of a horse-drawn
    carriage whipping a horse).

    the second, a point penalty; the third and
    successive violations, a game penalty
    each.
    
    A code violation may also be judged severe
    enough to result in the player having to

    so, and are usually best of three, instead
    of five, sets.

    team looking to gain Davis/Fed Cup match
    experience.

    is said to have the advantage.

let

    The umpire indicates this type of let by

    Second serve." Lets typically occur when
    an otherwise-valid serve makes contact
    with the net before hitting the ground.
    
    Theoretically, a player could serve an
    unlimited number of otherwise-valid let
    serves, but a serve that touches the net
    and then lands out of bounds counts as one
    of the two allowed serves.
    
    A let can also be called during play when
    there is some distraction to either player
    not caused by the players themselves, such
    as a ball boy moving behind a receiver,
    debris flying across the court in windy
    conditions, or a ball accidentally falling
    out of a player's pocket or entering from
    a neighboring court.
    
    The call is made by the chair umpire when
    one is assigned to the match, as in
    professional matches, or one of the
    players when there is no chair umpire.
    
    When a receiver is legitimately unprepared
    for a serve, a let is technically the
    result, even if the word goes unspoken.

line call
call
    Call made by the line judge.
    
    A call of 'out' will be made in
    combination with an outstretched arm
    pointing sideways if a ball lands outside
    the court and if the ball is 'in', i.e.
    
    lands on or within the outer lines, this
    is indicated by holding both hands
    flattened and the arms stretched
    downwards.

    be overruled by the players.

    decision, even when it contradicts their

    outright.
    
    In a defensive lob, the intent is to give
    the player time to recover and get in
    position, or, if the opponents are at the
    net, to force them to chase down the lob.

seed
seeding
    Player whose position in a tournament has
    been arranged based on their ranking so as
    not to meet other ranking players in the
    early rounds of play.
    
    Named for the similarity to scattering
    seeds widely over the ground to plant
    them.
    
    For a given tournament there is a
    specified number of seeds, depending on
    the size of the draw.
    
    For ATP tournaments, typically one out of
    four players are seeds.
    
    For example, a 32-draw ATP Tour 250
    tournament would have eight seeds.
    
    The seeds are chosen and ranked by the
    tournament organizers and are selected
    because they are the players with the
    highest ranking who also, in the
    estimation of the organizers, have the
    best chance of winning the tournament.
    
    Seed ranking is sometimes controversial,
    because it does not always match the
    players' current ATP ranking.
