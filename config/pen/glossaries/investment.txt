dividend
    A distribution of profits by a corporation
    to its shareholders.
    
    When a corporation earns a profit or
    surplus, it is able to pay a proportion of
    the profit as a dividend to shareholders.
    
    Any amount not distributed is taken to be
    re-invested in the business (called
    retained earnings).

    Traditionally done through cold calling.
    
    But with the advent of the internet, this
    illegal practice has become even more
    prevalent.
    
    Fraudsters post messages online enticing
    investors to buy a stock quickly, with
    claims to have inside information that a
    development will lead to an upswing in the
    share's price.
    
    Once buyers jump in, the perpetrators sell
    their shares, causing the price to drop
    dramatically.
    
    New investors then lose their money.
    
    These schemes usually target micro- and
    small-cap stocks, as they are the easiest
    to manipulate.
    
    Due to the small float of these types of
    stocks, it does not take a lot of new
    buyers to push a stock higher.

    The same scheme can be perpetrated by
    anyone with access to an online trading
    account and the ability to convince other
    investors to buy a stock supposedly ready
    to take off.
    
    The schemer can get the action going by
    buying heavily into a stock that trades on
    low volume, which usually pumps up the
    price.
    
    The price action induces other investors
    to buy heavily, pumping the share price
    even higher.
    
    At any point when the perpetrator feels
    the buying pressure is ready to fall off,
    he can dump his shares
