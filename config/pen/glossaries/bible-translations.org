NASB
    https://www.biblegateway.com/versions/New-American-Standard-Bible-NASB/

    The NASB does not attempt to interpret
    Scripture through translation.
    
    Instead, the NASB adheres to the
    principles of a formal equivalence
    translation.
    
    This is the most exacting and demanding
    method of translation, striving for the
    most readable word-for-word translation
    that is both accurate and clear.
    
    This method more closely follows the word
    and sentence patterns of the biblical
    authors in order to enable the reader to
    study Scripture in its most literal format
    and to experience the individual
    personalities of those who penned the
    original manuscripts.
    
    NEW AMERICAN STANDARD BIBLE 2020 UPDATE

    After completion in 1971, the NASB was
    updated in 1977, 1995, and most recently
    in 2020.
    
    This brand new update of the widely
    respected NASB 1995 builds upon its
    strengths by further improving accuracy,
    modernizing language, and improving
    readability.
    
    The NASB 2020 is an important update
    because it utilizes advances in biblical
    scholarship over the past 25 years and it
    incorporates changes necessary to keep
    pace with the ever evolving English
    language.
    
    This refreshed text is designed to speak
    accurately and clearly to current and
    future generations.
    
    The long-established translation standard
    for the NASB remains the same as it always
    has been, that is to accurately translate
    the inspired Word of God from the Hebrew,
    Aramaic, and Greek texts into modern
    English that is clearly understandable
    today.
    
    The NASB 2020 is a Bible that is
    accessible to all readers and is presented
    in a way that clearly and accurately
    communicates the content, so it is
    understood in the same way it would have
    been to the original audience.
    
    Most importantly, the NASB 2020 provides a
    literal translation of the Bible that
    clearly communicates Godâ€™s message to the
    modern English reader so that everyone can
    continue to grow in their knowledge and
    love of our Lord, God, and Savior, Jesus
    Christ.
