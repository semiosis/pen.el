Design FMEA
DFMEA
    Explores the possibility of product
    malfunctions, reduced product life, and
    safety and regulatory concerns derived
    from:
    - Material Properties
    - Geometry
    - Tolerances
    - Interfaces with other components and/or
      systems
    - Engineering Noise: environments, user
      profile, degradation, systems
      interactions

Process FMEA
PFMEA
    Discovers failure that impacts product
    quality, reduced reliability of the
    process, customer dissatisfaction, and
    safety or environmental hazards derived
    from:
    - Human Factors
    - Methods followed while processing
    - Materials used
    - Machines utilized
    - Measurement systems impact on acceptance
    - Environment Factors on process performance
