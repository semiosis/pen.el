Garohevtee
gahrohevtee
    Literally "great words".

    A special set of written words with unique
    symbols, which are used in regestoy to
    describe the contents, properties, and
    patterns of an Age.
    
    The concepts which they represent do not
    have direct English equivalents, and have
    been described as "something beyond labels
    and ideas[, s]omething which is a
    synthesis of the two."

Atrus
    In the ruins of D'ni Atrus plays the
    central character in the Book of Atrus,
    the prequel to the original Myst game.
    This book shows Atrus growing up, first in
    the Cleft with his grandmother, then as he
    learns to write Ages with his father.

Gehn
    Came back to the cleft when Atrus was
    fourteen and took the boy from his
    grandmother.
    
    He led Atrus down into the underground
    D'ni capital and told him about his
    heritage.
    
    Living on the island of K'veer he taught
    Atrus to write, and how to travel back and
    forth through Ages safely.
    
    By the end of his teen years, Atrus came
    to realize that Gehn was a madman.

Myst
    The book series.

    See "Myst Island".

Myst Island
    An age created by Catherine and Ti'ana,
    and the central hub for the game Myst. 

cleft
    A space or opening made by or as if by
    splitting.

Catherine
    Atrus' wife.
    
    She is a native of Riven and a former
    student of Gehn.
    
    Her name was actually Katran, emphasis on
    the second syllable
    
    (Ka-tran).
    
    She worked with Anna to write the Age of
    Myst and to trap Gehn on Riven.
    
    Her Ages always exhibit symbiosis more
    dramatically than of Atrus.
    
    Catherine proves to be a genius in
    stretching and bending the laws of the Art
    to their limit, creating dream-like Ages,
    such as Torus, and Serenia.
