near field
far field
    The near field and far field are regions
    of the electromagnetic (EM) field around
    an object, such as a transmitting antenna,
    or the result of radiation scattering off
    an object. Non-radiative near-field
    behaviors dominate close to the antenna or
    scattering object, while electromagnetic
    radiation far-field behaviors dominate at
    greater distances.

    Far-field E (electric) and B (magnetic)
    field strength decreases as the distance
    from the source increases, resulting in an
    inverse-square law for the radiated power
    intensity of electromagnetic radiation. By
    contrast, near-field E and B strength
    decrease more rapidly with distance: the
    radiative field decreases by the
    inverse-distance squared, the reactive
    field by an inverse-cube law, resulting in
    a diminished power in the parts of the
    electric field by an inverse fourth-power
    and sixth-power, respectively. The rapid
    drop in power contained in the near-field
    ensures that effects due to the near-field
    essentially vanish a few wavelengths away
    from the radiating part of the antenna.

Fresnel integral
    The Fresnel integrals S(x) and C(x) are
    two transcendental functions named after
    Augustin-Jean Fresnel that are used in
    optics and are closely related to the
    error function (erf).

    They arise in the description of
    near-field Fresnel diffraction phenomena
    and are defined through the following
    integral representations:

        {\displaystyle S(x)=\int _{0}^{x}\sin \left(t^{2}\right)\,dt,\quad C(x)=\int _{0}^{x}\cos \left(t^{2}\right)\,dt.}
