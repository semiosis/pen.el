norovirus
    Within a day of infection, noroviruses
    have rewired our digestive system so that
    stuff comes flying out from both ends.
    
    To trigger diarrhea, the viruses alter the
    intestinal lining, causing cells to dump
    out their fluids, which then gets washed
    out of the bodyâ€“along with many, many,
    many noroviruses.
