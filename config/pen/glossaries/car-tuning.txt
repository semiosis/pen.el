carburetor
carburettor
carb
carby
    A device that mixes air and fuel for
    internal combustion engines in the proper
    airâ€“fuel ratio for combustion.
    
    It is sometimes colloquially shortened to
    carb in the UK and North America or carby
    in Australia.

    A device used by an internal combustion
    engine to control and mix air and fuel
    entering the engine.
    
    The primary method of adding fuel to the
    intake air is through the venturi tube in
    the main metering circuit, however various
    other components are also used to provide
    extra fuel or air in specific
    circumstances.
    
    Since the 1990s, carburetors have been
    largely replaced by fuel injection for
    cars and trucks, however carburetors are
    still used by some small engines (e.g.
    
    lawnmowers, generators and concrete
    mixers) and motorcycles.
    
    Diesel engines have always used fuel
    injection instead of carburetors.

camshaft
cam
    NLG: "Camshaft" refers to the shaft that
    connects the crankshaft to the valves in a
    car engine. The camshaft is also known as
    the "cam".

crankshaft
    NLG: "Crankshaft" refers to the part of an
    engine that converts the reciprocating
    motion of the piston into rotational
    motion.
    
    The crankshaft is a rotating part itself,
    called a "rotating axis".
    
    A "crankshaft" can be visually identified
    by the presence of the crank disc, also
    called the crank journal, on which the
    piston rod travels.

intake manifold
    NLG: "Intake manifold" refers to the part
    of an engine that distributes the fuel-air
    mixture to the cylinders.
    
    It is usually cast from aluminum or cast
    iron and is sometimes called a plenum
    chamber.

Single Overhead Cam
    NLG: "Single Overhead Cam" refers to an
    internal combustion engine with one
    camshaft to open the valves (as opposed to
    two camshafts as in a "twin overhead cam"
    engine).

piston
    NLG: "Piston" refers to the part of the
    engine that moves up and down, driven by
    the engine's crankshaft, and which in turn
    drives the wheels of the car.

crank disc
    NLG: "Crank disc" refers to the disc that
    is installed on the crank shaft of a car
    engine. The crank disc is usually
    attached to the flywheel of the engine.

flywheel
    NLG: "Flywheel" refers to a heavy wheel
    that stores kinetic energy, which can be
    transferred to a crankshaft to provide a
    torque to the engine.

torque
    NLG: "Torque" refers to the turning force
    that causes rotation. It is usually
    measured in foot-pounds or Newton-meters
    (Nm).
