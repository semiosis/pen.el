Two-dimensionalism
    [#analytic philosophy]

    An approach to semantics.
    
    It is a theory of how to determine the
    sense and reference of a word and the
    truth-value of a sentence.
    
    It is intended to resolve the puzzle: How
    is it possible to discover empirically
    that a necessary truth is true? Two-
    dimensionalism provides an analysis of the
    semantics of words and sentences that
    makes sense of this possibility.
    
    The theory was first developed by Robert
    Stalnaker, but it has been advocated by
    numerous philosophers since, including
    David Chalmers.
