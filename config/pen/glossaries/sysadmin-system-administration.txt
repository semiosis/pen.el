runit
    An init scheme for Unix-like operating
    systems that initializes, supervises, and
    ends processes throughout the operating
    system.
    
    Runit is a reimplementation of the
    daemontools process supervision toolkit
    that runs on many Linux-based operating
    systems, as well as, the macOS, *BSD, and
    Solaris operating systems.
    
    Runit features parallelization of the
    start up of system services, which can
    speed up the boot time of the operating
    system.

Runit
    An init daemon, so it is the direct or
    indirect ancestor of all other processes.
    
    It is the first process started during
    booting, and continues running until the
    system is shut down.

daemontools
    A process control system by D.J.
    Bernstein.

supervise
    [daemontools]

    monitors a service.
    
    It starts the service and restarts the
    service if it dies.
    
    Setting up a new service is easy: all
    supervise needs is a directory with a run
    script that runs the service.

multilog
    [daemontools]

    saves error messages to one or more logs.
    
    It optionally timestamps each line and,
    for each log, includes or excludes lines
    matching specified patterns.
    
    It automatically rotates logs to limit the
    amount of disk space used.
    
    If the disk fills up, it pauses and tries
    again, without losing any data.

Daemon Tools
    [#windows]

    Virtual drive and optical disc authoring
    program for Microsoft Windows and Mac OS.

launchd
    A process control system used by Apple as
    process 1 under Mac OS X.

runit
    A process control system.

Superlance
    A package which provides various event
    listener implementations that plug into
    Supervisor which can help monitor process
    memory usage and crash status:

umask
    Abbreviation of user mask: sets the file
