remote viewing
    The practice of seeking impressions about
    a distant or unseen subject, purportedly
    sensing with the mind.
    
    Typically a remote viewer is expected to
    give information about an object, event,
    person or location that is hidden from
    physical view and separated at some
    distance.

extra-sensory perception
ESP
sixth sense
    Includes claimed reception of information
    not gained through the recognized physical
    senses, but sensed with the mind.

telepathy
    The supposed communication of thoughts or
    ideas by means other than the known
    senses.

    The purported vicarious transmission of
    information from one person to another
    without using any known human sensory

retrocognitive telepathy
precognitive telepathy
intuitive telepathy

    the past, future or present state of an
    individual's mind to another individual.

latent telepathy
deferred telepathy
    [telepathy]

    Describes a transfer of information with
    an observable time-lag between
    transmission and reception.

Superconscious
Superconscious telepathy
    [telepathy]

    Describes use of the supposed
    superconscious to access the collective
    wisdom of the human species for knowledge.

precognition
prescience
future vision
future sight
promnesia
    A claimed psychic ability to see events in
    the future.
    
    As with other paranormal phenomena, there
    is no accepted scientific evidence that
    precognition is a real effect and it is
    widely considered to be pseudoscience.

    Promnesia is similar to precognition,
    which means knowing something and being
    able to describe it before you encounter
    it, but has a more visual meaning. It's
    the déjà vu of parapsychology.

clairvoyance
    The supposed faculty of perceiving things
    or events in the future or beyond normal
    sensory contact.

psychokinesis
telekinesis
psychometry
    An alleged psychic ability allowing a
    person to influence a physical system
    without physical interaction.
    
    Psychokinesis experiments have
    historically been criticized for lack of
    proper controls and repeatability.

Russell Targ
    An American physicist, parapsychologist
    and author who is best known for his work
    on remote viewing.

Pat Price
    A former Burbank, California, police
    officer and former Scientologist who
    participated in a number of Cold War era
    remote viewing experiments, including the
    US government-sponsored projects SCANATE
    and the Stargate Project.
    
    Price joined the program after a chance
    encounter with fellow Scientologists (at
    the time) Harold Puthoff and Ingo Swann
    near SRI.
    
    Working with maps and photographs provided
    to him by the CIA, Price claimed to have
    been able to retrieve information from
    facilities behind Soviet lines.
    
    He is probably best known for his sketches
    of cranes and gantries which appeared to
    conform to CIA intelligence photographs.
    
    At the time, the CIA took his claims
    seriously.
