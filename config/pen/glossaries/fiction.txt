Law of Surprise
    [#the witcher]

    A law that can be invoked whenever
    someone's life is saved.
    
    Generally, what the Law of Surprise states
    is that the person whose life was saved
    should give to the savior something that
    they already owned but is still unknown.
    
    This can come in the form of a harvest or
    even a child.
