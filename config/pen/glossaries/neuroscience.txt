episodic memory
    Things that you remember from your life.

proprioception
    Sense of position and movement.

somatotopy
    The mapping of the body surfaces in the
    brain.

    In the cortex, it is also referred to as
    the cortical homunculus.

somatic senses
somesthetic senses
    Somesthesis includes the sense of touch,
    proprioception, and (depending on usage)
    haptic perception.

    This brain-surface ("cortical") map is not
    immutable, however.

    Dramatic shifts can occur in response to
    stroke or injury.

somatosensory system
    Part of the sensory nervous system.

    A complex system of sensory neurons and
    pathways that responds to changes at the
    surface or inside the body.

Somatosensation
    The axons (as afferent nerve fibers) of
    sensory neurons connect with, or respond
    to, various receptor cells.

    These sensory receptor cells are activated
    by different stimuli such as heat and
    nociception, giving a functional name to
    the responding sensory neuron, such as a
    thermoreceptor which carries information
    about temperature changes.

    Other types include mechanoreceptors,
    chemoreceptors, and nociceptors which send
    signals along a sensory nerve to the
    spinal cord where they may be processed by
    other sensory neurons and then relayed to
    the brain for further processing.

    Sensory receptors are found all over the
    body including the skin, epithelial
    tissues, muscles, bones and joints,
    internal organs, and the cardiovascular
    system.

neurons
    Represent information in the rate

    statistics and precise timing of spikes.

spinal nerves
    Emerge from segments of the spinal cord.

cranial nerves
    In contrast to spinal nerves.

    The nerves that emerge directly from the
    brain (including the brainstem).
    
    Ten of the cranial nerves originate in the
    brainstem.
    
    Cranial nerves relay information between
    the brain and parts of the body, primarily
    to and from regions of the head and
    neck.

    Spinal nerves emerge sequentially from the
    spinal cord with the spinal nerve closest
    to the head (C1) emerging in the space
    above the first cervical vertebra.
    
    The cranial nerves, however, emerge from
    the central nervous system above this
    level.
    
    Each cranial nerve is paired and is
    present on both sides.
    
    Depending on definition in humans there
    are twelve or thirteen cranial nerves
    pairs, which are assigned Roman numerals
    
    Iâ€“XII, sometimes also including cranial
    nerve zero.
    
    The numbering of the cranial nerves is
    based on the order in which they emerge
    from the brain, front to back (brainstem).
    
    The terminal nerves (0), olfactory nerves
    (I) and optic nerves (II) emerge from the
    cerebrum or forebrain, and the remaining
    ten pairs arise from the brainstem, which
    is the lower part of the brain.
    
    The cranial nerves are considered
    components of the peripheral nervous
    system (PNS), although on a structural
    level the olfactory (I), optic (II), and
    trigeminal (V) nerves are more accurately
    considered part of the central nervous
    system (CNS).

plasticity rule
    When one neuron drives the activity of
    another neuron, the connection between
    these neurons is potentiated.

potentiated
    Increase the power, effect, or likelihood
    of (something, especially a drug or
    physiological reaction).

spikes
    [#neuralink]

    Invasive.
        Need invasive BCI to monitor spikes.

    Give the most information.

    No ceiling compared to EEG or other
    methods.

Dendritic arbor

DBS
Deep Brain Stimulation

N1

    Contains:
    - N1 Sensor.

haptic feedback
    - flash of light
    - sensation of typing with anethetised
      hands
