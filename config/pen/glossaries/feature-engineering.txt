missing values
    [#feature engineering]

    Values that are not recorded during data
    collection.
    
    They are mostly not provided, left out due
    to errors, or too difficult to measure.
    
    Missing values may be very important to
    models, and as such there exist numerous
    ways and techniques to handle them.
    
    Letâ€™s go over some of these techniques.

    The choice of technique is dependent on
    the type of features you have. For
    categorical features, you can do things
    like:

    - Mode filling
      Fill missing values with the most
      popular/frequent/modal class.

    - Temporal filling (forward or backward fill)
      Fill missing values with the preceding
      value (top-down) or with the succeeding
      value (bottom-up).

    - Encoding and fill
      In this method, you can encode the
      values using different strategies, and
      then fill with either the mean, mode, or
      the median.

categorical features
    [#feature engineering]

    Features that can take on values from a
    limited set.
    
    For example, the relative hotness of a
    place/thing (hot, hotter, hottest) or star
    ratings for an application (1,2,3,4,5).
    
    In regards to our dataset, features like
    level_of_education_clients in the
    loan_demographics dataset is a categorical
    feature containing classes like Secondary,
    Graduate, Post-Graduate, and Primary.
