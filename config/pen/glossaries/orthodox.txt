illumination
    What is illumination?
    
    Essentially, illumination is not
    illumination of the rational faculty.
    
    Of course there is illumination of the
    rational faculty: one prays, goes to
    church, fasts.
    
    One orientates the rational faculty
    towards doing the right thing: liberating
    slaves, helping the poor, going
    voluntarily to give blood, all those sorts
    of things.
    
    To the Fathers, illumination is not the
    enlightenment of the rational faculty, but
    of the heart.
    
    There is the purification of the heart,
    then the illumination of the heart, which
    is not a rational enlightenment but a
    spiritual enlightenment - this is
    illumination.
    
    This is the cure.
    
    The illness is when the nous is darkened
    and the cure is when the nous is
    illumined.

icon
    An icon (from Ancient Greek εἰκών (eikṓn)
    'image, resemblance') is a religious work
    of art, most commonly a painting, in the
    cultures of the Eastern Orthodox, Oriental
    Orthodox, the Roman Catholic, and Eastern
    Catholic churches.
    
    They are not simply artworks; "an icon is
    a sacred image used in religious
    devotion".
    
    The most common subjects include Christ,
    Mary, saints and angels.
    
    Although especially associated with
    portrait-style images concentrating on one
    or two main figures, the term also covers
    most religious images in a variety of
    artistic media produced by Eastern
    Christianity, including narrative scenes,
    usually from the Bible or the lives of
    saints.
    
    Icons are most commonly painted on wood
    panels with egg tempera, but they may also
    be cast in metal, carved in stone,
    embroidered on cloth, done in mosaic or
    fresco work, printed on paper or metal,
    etc.
    
    Comparable images from Western
    Christianity can be classified as "icons",
    although "iconic" may also be used to
    describe a static style of devotional
    image.
    
    In the Greek language, the term for icon
    painting uses the same word as for
    "writing", and Orthodox sources often
    translate it into English as icon writing.
    
    Eastern Orthodox tradition holds that the
    production of Christian images dates back
    to the very early days of Christianity,
    and that it has been a continuous
    tradition since then.
    
    Modern academic art history considers
    that, while images may have existed
    earlier, the tradition can be traced back
    only as far as the 3rd century, and that
    the images which survive from Early
    Christian art often differ greatly from
    later ones.
    
    The icons of later centuries can be
    linked, often closely, to images from the
    5th century onwards, though very few of
    these survive.
    
    Widespread destruction of images occurred
    during the Byzantine Iconoclasm of
    726–842, although this did settle
    permanently the question of the
    appropriateness of images.
    
    Since then, icons have had a great
    continuity of style and subject, far
    greater than in the icons of the Western
    church.
    
    At the same time there have been change
    and development.
