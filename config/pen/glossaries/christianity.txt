metanoia
    [#Christian theology]

    Change in one's way of life resulting from
    penitence or spiritual conversion.
    "what he demanded of people was metanoia,
    repentance, a complete change of heart"

    Commonly understood as "a transformative
    change of heart; especially: a spiritual
    conversion".

    The term suggests repudiation, change of
    mind, repentance, and atonement; but
    "conversion" and "reformation" may best
    approximate its connotation.

Temple menorah
menorah
    Reconstruction of the menorah of the
    Temple in Jerusalem, created by the Temple
    Institute of Israel The menorah
    (/məˈnɔːrə/; Hebrew: מְנוֹרָה, Hebrew
    pronunciation: [menoˈʁa]) is a seven-
    branched candelabrum that is described in
    the Hebrew Bible as having been used in
    the Tabernacle and in the Temple in
    Jerusalem.

    Since antiquity, it has served as a symbol
    of the Jewish people and Judaism in both
    the Land of Israel and the Diaspora; it is
    depicted on the Israeli national emblem.

    According to the Hebrew Bible, the menorah
    was made out of pure gold, and the only
    source of fuel that was allowed to be used
    to light the lamps was fresh olive oil.

    Biblical tradition holds that Solomon's
    Temple was home to ten menorahs, which
    were later plundered by the Babylonians;
    the Second Jewish Temple is also said to
    have been home to a menorah.

    Following the Roman besiegement of
    Jerusalem in 70 CE, the menorah was taken
    to Rome; the Arch of Titus, which still
    stands today, famously depicts the menorah
    being carried away by the triumphant
    Romans along with other spoils of the
    destroyed Second Jewish Temple.

    Traces of the temple menorah have been
    lost since late antiquity.

    Representations of the temple menorah have
    been discovered on Jewish tombs and
    monuments dating from the first century.

    As a symbol, the menorah has been used
    since then to distinguish synagogues and
    Jewish cemeteries from the places of
    worship and cemeteries of Christians and
    pagans.

    The Hanukkah menorah, a nine-branched
    variant, is closely associated with the
    Jewish festival of Hanukkah.

intercession
intercessory prayer
    The act of praying to a deity on behalf of
    others, or asking a saint in heaven to
    pray on behalf of oneself or for others.

    The Apostle Paul's exhortation to Timothy
    specified that intercession prayers should
    be made for all people.

jubilee
    A particular anniversary of an event.

catechist

    religion, especially one using a
    catechism.

propitiation
    The act of appeasing or making well-
    disposed a deity, thus incurring divine
    favor or avoiding divine retribution.

    While some use the term interchangeably
    with expiation, others draw a sharp
    distinction between the two.

    The action of propitiating or appeasing a
    god, spirit, or person.
    "he lifted his hands in propitiation"

    Atonement, especially that of Jesus

veneration
veneration of saints
    The act of honoring a saint, a person who
    has been identified as having a high
    degree of sanctity or holiness.

    Angels are shown similar veneration in
    many religions.

    "Ambrose of Milan" was venerated as St.
    Ambrose"

Jacob
Israel
    Patriarch.

patriarch
    The male head of a family or tribe.

    Any of those biblical figures regarded as
    fathers of the human race, especially
    Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and their
    forefathers, or the sons of Jacob.

Lion of Judah
    A Jewish national and cultural symbol,
    traditionally regarded as the symbol of
    the tribe of Judah.

    The association between the Judahites and
    the lion can first be found in the
    blessing given by Jacob to his fourth son,
    Judah, in the Book of Genesis of the
    Hebrew Bible.

    Emblem of Jerusalem.

    Judah is the eponymous ancestor of the
    Tribe of Judah.

    The Tribe of Judah is traditionally
    symbolized by a lion.

    In Genesis, the patriarch Jacob gave that
    symbol to this tribe when he refers to his
    son Judah as a Gur Aryeh', "Young Lion"
    (Genesis 49:9) when blessing him.

    In Jewish naming tradition the Hebrew name
    and the substitute name are often combined
    as a pair, as in this case.

    The Lion of Judah was used as a Jewish
    symbol for many years, and as Jerusalem
    was the capital of the Kingdom of Judah,
    in 1950 it was included in the Emblem of
    Jerusalem.

    Revelation 5:5
        Then one of the elders said to me, 'Do
        not weep. See, the Lion of the tribe
        of Judah, the Root of David, has
        conquered, so that he can open the
        scroll and its seven seals.'

Paschal mystery
    One of the central concepts of Catholic
    faith relating to the history of
    salvation.

    According to the Compendium of the
    Catechism of the Catholic Church, "The
    Paschal Mystery of Jesus, which comprises
    his passion, death, resurrection, and
    glorification, stands at the center of the
    Christian faith because God's saving plan
    was accomplished once for all by the
    redemptive death of himself as Jesus
    Christ." The Catechism states that in the
    liturgy of the Church "it is principally
    his own Paschal mystery that Christ
    signifies and makes present."

    According to the Book of Exodus, God
    (Yahweh) commanded Moses to tell the
    Israelites to mark a lamb's blood above
    their doors in order that the Angel of
    Death would pass over them.

    Paschal refers to the passage of God's
    destroying angel on the night of Passover.

    The angel "passed over" the houses of the
    Israelites but killed the firstborn child
    in the houses of the Egyptians.

salt
    According to Benny Hinn:
    - We are the salt and supposed to
      "restrain and oppose sin".
      - https://www.youtube.com/shorts/8eRzjKG4RRk

    https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%205%3A13-16&version=NIV

    Matthew 5:13-16

    “You are the salt of the earth. But if the
    salt loses its saltiness, how can it be
    made salty again? It is no longer good for
    anything, except to be thrown out and
    trampled underfoot.

logion
    A saying attributed to Christ, especially
    one not recorded in the canonical Gospels.

Faith
    Belief + faithfulness, or
    Gnosis + faithfulness.

    If you consciously believe something:
    - You believe it's absolutely true.
    - That belief is in your mind.

    And you hold to it:
    - You don't cave in.
    - You hold out for it.
    - You are unwavering.
    - It's faithful to God.

    That is faith.

    Faith does not require gnosis, but gnosis
    makes it easier to have faith.

    Faith without knowledge is very blessed.

Gnosis
Knowldege
    Beyond mere belief.

    Total conviction that something is true;
    to think otherwise is 100% counter-factual
    beyond refutation.

    Reality.

    Typically means the gnosis of the Pleroma
    or of spiritual matters.

hypostatic union
    A technical term in Christian theology
    employed in mainstream Christology to
    describe the union of Christ's humanity
    and divinity in one hypostasis, or
    individual existence.

    The most basic explanation for the
    hypostatic union is Jesus Christ being
    both fully God and fully man.

dunamis
dynamei
dynameis
    https://www.billmounce.com/greek-dictionary/dynamis

    Power, ability.

    Miracle.

    Ruler, an extended meaning of a person or
    supernatural being who has administrative
    power.

    Potentiality.

potentiality
actuality
    [#philosophy]

    Potentiality and actuality are a pair of
    closely connected principles which
    Aristotle used to analyze motion,
    causality, ethics, and physiology in his
    Physics, Metaphysics, Nicomachean Ethics,
    and De Anima.

potentiality
dunamis
    By contrast, potentiality (dunamis in
    Greek) is not a mode in which a thing
    exists, but rather the power to effect
    change, the capacity of a think to make
    transitions into different states.

    Later, in the philosophy of Husserl,
    actuality means existence in space and
    time, as opposed to possibility.

energeia
    A word based upon ἔργον (ergon), meaning
    'work'. It is the source of the modern
    word energy but the term has evolved so
    much over the course of the history of
    science that reference to the modern term
    is not very helpful in understanding the
    original as used by Aristotle.

exousia
    The second most prevalent word used to
    describe power in Scripture. Used 103
    times in the New Testament, this word
    represents the power that comes from
    delegated authority.

    Colossians 1:16 tells us that all
    authority (exousia) in Heaven, on earth,
    and everywhere in between, belongs to God
    alone. He has the right to delegate His
    supreme authority to whomever He pleases.
    Scripture shows examples of this.

    God gives His authority to Jesus: “Then
    Jesus came to them and said, “All
    authority [exousia] in heaven and on earth
    has been given to me” (Matthew 28:18).

christos
meshiah
Messiah
    The anointed one.

Christ
    [name]

    Christ was not originally a name but a
    title derived from the Greek word
    christos, which translates the Hebrew term
    meshiah (Messiah), meaning “the anointed
    one.”

    This title indicates that Jesus' followers
    believed him to be the anointed son of
    King David, whom some Jews expected to
    restore the fortunes of Israel.

providence
    Divine guidance or care.

doxology
    A liturgical formula of praise to God.

Logos
    The Word of God, or principle of divine
    reason and creative order, identified in
    the Gospel of John with the second person
    of the Trinity incarnate in Jesus Christ.

water of lustration
water of expiation
water of separation
water of cleansing
water for impurity
lustral water
    Appointed for the cleansing of them that
    are in a state of separation, who for
    their uncleanness are separated from the
    congregation.

    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_of_lustration

royal law
law of liberty
    James 2:8-13

    8 If you really fulfill the royal law
    according to the Scripture, “You shall
    love your neighbor as yourself,” you are
    doing well.

    9 But if you show partiality, you are
    committing sin and are convicted by the
    law as transgressors.

    10 For whoever keeps the whole law but
    fails in one point has become guilty of
    all of it.

    11 For he who said, “Do not commit
    adultery,” also said, “Do not murder.” If
    you do not commit adultery but do murder,
    you have become a transgressor of the law.

    12 So speak and so act as those who are to
    be judged under the law of liberty.

    13 For judgment is without mercy to one
    who has shown no mercy.

    Mercy triumphs over judgment.

eikon
    An image, figure, likeness.
    An image of the things (the heavenly things).
    Used of the moral likeness of renewed men to God.
    The image of the Son of God, into which true Christians are transformed,
      is likeness not only to the heavenly body,
      but also to the most holy and blessed state of mind, which Christ possesses.
    The image of one.
    One in whom the likeness of any one is seen.

Septuagint
    [Book]

    The Greek Old Testament, or Septuagint, is
    the earliest extant Greek translation of
    books from the Hebrew Bible. It includes
    several books beyond those contained in
    the Masoretic text of the Hebrew Bible as
    canonically used in the tradition of
    mainstream Rabbinical Judaism.

amillenarism
amillennialism
    A type of chillegorism which teaches and
    believed that there will be no millennial
    reign of the righteous on Earth.

    Amillennialists interpret the thousand
    years symbolically to refer either to a
    temporary bliss of souls in heaven before
    the general resurrection, or to the
    infinite bliss of the righteous after the
    general resurrection.

chillegorism
    A millenarian doctrine which is the
    opposite of Chiliasm.

    It is based on a figurative interpretation
    of the prophecy of Revelation 20:1-4 about
    the millennial reign of Christ together
    with the righteous.

Sabaoth

    “Lord (God) of Sabaoth”).

theosis

    by the Eastern Orthodox Church and the
    Catholic Church.

profession of faith
    [#Baptist]
    [#Pentecostal]
    [#Nondenominational Christianity]

    Consists in witnessing to one's personal
    conversion and to one's faith in Jesus,
    before the believer's baptism.

    This rite is thus reserved for adolescents
    and adults.

rhema
    A process within Christian epistemology.

    In this understanding, the logos is
    universal for all humanity, while any
    intellectual changes for a specific
    individual believer are categorized as
    rhema.

    Under this system, "rhema" is a broad term
    that includes many types of spiritual
    interaction; "any method God uses to
    reveal His specific will to an individual,
    whether by divinely directed desire,
    illumination, revelation, vision, or
    dream.

    ...rhema will be our general term to refer
    to all of these means of God communicating
    His specific will to an individual." Hamon
    states "A rhema is an inspired Word
    birthed within your own spirit, a whisper
    from the Holy Spirit like the still, small
    voice that spoke to Elijah in the cave.

    It is a divinely inspired impression upon
    your soul, a flash of thought or a
    creative idea from God.

    It is conceived in your spirit, but
    birthed into your natural understanding by
    divine illumination.

    A true rhema carries with it a deep inner
    assurance and witness of the Spirit."

    Our general term to refer to all of these
    means of God communicating His specific
    will to an individual." Hamon states "A
    rhema is an inspired Word birthed within
    your own spirit, a whisper from the Holy
    Spirit like the still, small voice that
    spoke to Elijah in the cave.

    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhema_(doctrine)

atonement
    The moral influence or moral example
    theory of atonement, developed or most
    notably propagated by Abelard (1079–1142),
    [note 1] is an alternative to Anselm's
    satisfaction theory of atonement.

    Abelard focused on changing man's
    perception of God as not offended, harsh,
    and judgmental, but as loving.

    According to Abelard, "Jesus died as the
    demonstration of God's love," a
    demonstration which can change the hearts
    and minds of the sinners, turning back to
    God.

    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moral_influence_theory_of_atonement

liturgy
    The customary public worship performed by
    a religious group.

    Liturgy can also be used to refer
    specifically to public worship of
    Christians.

Gnosticism
    The result of Christianity spreading in
    the gentile world, where it crashed into
    other cultures with their own:
    - religions
    - philosophies
    - ideologies

    It's a fairly early development within
    Christianity.

    Some would go so far as to say that
    Gnosticism is the original form of
    Christianity.

    Viewed as a Christian heresy and their
    writings were banned destroyed and often
    burned by so-called proto-orthodox
    Christians.

proto-orthodoxy
proto-orthodox Christianity
    Often erroneously thought to have been
    coined by New Testament scholar Bart D.

    Ehrman, who borrowed it from Bentley
    Layton, and describes the early Christian
    movement that was the precursor of
    Christian orthodoxy.

lacuna
    A hole in a manuscript.

    An unfilled space; a gap.
    "the journal has filled a lacuna in Middle

    bone.

Nicene Creed
    A confession of faith that expresses the
    divinity and unity of the trinity:
    - Father,
    - Son, and
    - Holy Spirit.

    The Creed articulated the church's
    understanding of Scripture during a time
    of division.

    The original Nicene Creed was first
    adopted at the First Council of Nicaea in
    325.

    In 381, it was amended at the First
    Council of Constantinople.

    The amended form is also referred to as
    the Nicene Creed, or the Niceno-
    Constantinopolitan Creed for
    disambiguation.

catechism
    A summary or exposition of doctrine and
    serves as a learning introduction to the
    Sacraments traditionally used in
    catechesis, or Christian religious
    teaching of children and adult converts.

catechesis
    Basic Christian religious education of
    children and adults, often from a
    catechism book.

    It started as education of converts to
    Christianity, but as the religion became
    institutionalized, catechesis was used for
    education of members who had been baptized
    as infants.

doctrine
    A codification of beliefs or a body of
    teachings or instructions, taught
    principles or positions, as the essence of
    teachings in a given branch of knowledge

    "catechism".

Septuagint
    A Greek version of the Hebrew Bible (or
    Old Testament), including the Apocrypha,
    made for Greek-speaking Jews in Egypt in
    the 3rd and 2nd centuries BC and adopted
    by the early Christian Churches.

Harrowing of Hell
    An Old English and Middle English term
    referring to the period of time between
    the Crucifixion of Jesus and his
    resurrection.

    In triumphant descent, Christ brought
    salvation to the souls held captive there
    since the beginning of the world.

    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harrowing_of_Hell

    This event is the supposed descent of
    Christ--following his crucifixion-- into
    Limbo, when he rescued and brought to
    heaven ("harrowing" implies a sort of
    violent abduction) his "ancestors" from
    the Hebrew Bible.

Christian anthropology
    [#Christian theology]

    The study of the human (anthropos) as it
    relates to God.

    human nature.

preterism
preterist
    Holds that Ancient Israel finds its
    continuation or fulfillment in the
    Christian church at the destruction of
    Jerusalem in AD 70.

    The term preterism comes from the Latin
    praeter, which is a prefix denoting that
    something is "past" or "beyond".

    Adherents of preterism are known as
    preterists. They believe that 'most of
    prophesy' has already happened.

Isaiah
Esaias
    Name means
    - "jehovah is helper", or
    - "salvation is of the lord".

    The name of the greatest of the Assyrian
    group of prophets is synonymous with
    Joshua or Jesus and symbolic of his
    message.

    Little is known of this gospel prophet,
    often severe in tone.

    He is described as the son of Amoz, not
    Amos the prophet (Isa. 1:1; 2:1; 6:1; 7:3;
    13:1).

    Some scholars suggest that Amoz was the
    uncle of Uzziah which, if true, would make
    Isaiah the king’s cousin.

    Evidently Isaiah was of good family and
    education.

    claimed author is not the true author, or
    a work whose real author attributed it to
    a figure of the past.

    In biblical studies, the term
    pseudepigrapha can refer to an assorted
    collection of Jewish religious works
    thought to be written c. 300 BCE to 300
    CE.

    Examples:
    - 1 Enoch
    - 2 Esdras

presuppositionalism
presuppositional apologetics
    A school of Christian apologetics that
    believes the Christian faith is the only
    basis for rational thought.

    It presupposes that the Bible is divine
    revelation and attempts to expose flaws in
    other worldviews.

    One of the four main approaches to
    apologetics, along with classical,
    evidential, and experiential or narratival
    apologetics.

    Each of these approaches places a
    different emphasis on the roles of reason
    and special revelation (such as Scripture
    or miracles) in apologetics.

classical apologetics
traditional apologetics
    A method of apologetics that begins by
    first employing various theistic arguments
    to establish the existence of God.

    Classical apologists will often utilize
    various forms of the cosmological,
    teleological (Design), ontological, and
    moral arguments to prove God’s existence.

    Once God’s existence has been established,
    the classical apologist will then move on
    to present evidence from fulfilled
    prophecy, the historical reliability of
    Scripture, and the bodily resurrection of
    Jesus to distinguish Christianity from all
    other competing forms of theism.

    classical apologetics has as its
    distinctive feature a two-step approach to
    establishing a Christian worldview.

    Classical apologists are often hesitant to
    make an argument directly from miracles to
    the biblical God.

    Rather, they prefer to appeal to miracles
    after having already established a
    theistic context.

    Modern proponents of classical apologetics
    include R.C.

    Sproul, William Lane Craig, and Norman
    Geisler.

evidential apologetics
evidentialism
    An approach to Christian apologetics
    emphasizing the use of evidence to
    demonstrate that God exists.

    The evidence is supposed to be evidence
    both the believer and nonbeliever share,
    that is to say one need not presuppose
    God's existence.

experiential apologetics
    Experiential apologetics is a reference to
    an appeal "primarily, if not exclusively,
    to experience as evidence for Christian
    faith."

    Also, "they spurn rational arguments or
    factual evidence in favor of what they
    believe to be a self-verifying
    experience."

    This view stresses experience that other
    apologists have not made as explicit, and
    in the end, the concept that the Holy
    Spirit convinces the heart of truth
    becomes the central theme of the
    apologetic argument.

narratival apologetics


dispensational
    A particular hermeneutic or analytical
    system for interpreting the Bible based on
    a literal translation, and which stands in
    contrast to the earlier Calvinist system
    of covenant theology used in biblical
    interpretation.

    Dispensationalism was first developed by
    John Nelson Darby around 1830, and
    considers biblical history as divided by
    God into dispensations, defined periods or
    ages to which God has allotted distinct
    covenants or administrative principles.

    According to dispensationalism, each age
    of God's plan is thus administered in a
    certain way, and humanity is held
    responsible as a steward during that time.

    Dispensationalists' presuppositions start
    with the inductive reasoning that biblical
    history has a particular discontinuity in
    the way God reacts to humanity in the
    unfolding of their, sometimes supposed,
    free wills.

premillennialism
    [#Christian eschatology]

    The belief that Jesus will physically
    return to the Earth (the Second Coming)
    before the Millennium, a literal thousand-
    year golden age of peace.

ecclesiastical
    Relating to the Christian Church or its
    clergy.
    "the ecclesiastical hierarchy"

complementarianism
    A theological view in Christianity,
    Judaism, and Islam, that men and women
    have different but complementary roles and
    responsibilities in marriage, family life,
    and religious leadership.

    The word "complementary" and its cognates
    are currently used to denote this view.

    Some Christians interpret the Bible as
    prescribing complementarianism, and
    therefore adhere to gender-specific roles
    that preclude women from specific
    functions of ministry within the
    community.

    Though women may be precluded from certain
    roles and ministries, they are held to be
    equal in moral value and of equal status.

    The phrase used to describe this is
    'Ontologically equal, Functionally
    different'.

    Complementarians assign primary headship
    roles to men and support roles to women
    based on their interpretation of certain
    biblical passages.

    One of the precepts of complementarianism
    is that while women may assist in the
    decision-making process, the ultimate
    authority for the decision is the purview
    of the male in marriage, courtship, and in
    the polity of churches subscribing to this
    view.

    The main contrasting viewpoint is
    egalitarianism, which maintains that
    positions of authority and responsibility
    in marriage and religion should be equally
    available to females as well as males.

restitution
    The restoration of something lost or
    stolen to its proper owner.

dispensation
dispensationalism
    A particular hermeneutic or analytical
    system for interpreting the Bible based on
    a literal translation, and which stands in
    contrast to the earlier Calvinist system
    of covenant theology used in biblical
    interpretation.

    Dispensationalism was first developed by
    John Nelson Darby around 1830, and
    considers biblical history as divided by
    God into dispensations, defined periods or
    ages to which God has allotted distinct
    covenants or administrative principles.

    According to dispensationalism, each age
    of God's plan is thus administered in a
    certain way, and humanity is held
    responsible as a steward during that time.

    Dispensationalists' presuppositions start
    with the inductive reasoning that biblical
    history has a particular discontinuity in
    the way God reacts to humanity in the
    unfolding of their, sometimes supposed,
    free wills.

    Dispensations:
    - Patriarch
    - Law, temple, priesthood
    - Gospel (requires individual response)

    Requirements were different, but one
    invarying requirement:
    - Learn to hear God's voice

    (known as Paschal Homily) are considered
    exemplary forms of Christian homily.

Divine command theory
    The belief that things are right because
    God commands them to be.

    In other words, it means that things which
    are considered wrong or unethical are
    wrong because they are forbidden by God.

    It is an absolutist theory.

    A meta-ethical theory which proposes that
    an action's status as morally good is
    equivalent to whether it is commanded by
    God.

    The theory asserts that what is moral is
    determined by God's commands and that for
    a person to be moral he is to follow God's
    commands.

John Wesley
Clergyman
    An English clergyman, theologian, and
    evangelist, who was a leader of a revival
    movement within the Church of England

    Catholic social teaching, as articulated
    in the latter half of the 20th century; it
    is also a theological emphasis in

    refers to a trend throughout the Bible, of
    preference being given to the well-being
    of the poor and powerless of society in
    the teachings and commands of God as well
    as the prophets and other righteous
    people.

double-mind
    “having in the mind opposite or opposing
    views at different times.” To be double-
    minded is the same as having a “double
    heart” (1 Chr.  12:33; Ps.  12:2).

    Double-mindedness is a sickness of the
    heart or inner man and cannot be corrected
    with medicine or any medical procedure.

    "rebellion".

    It has been described as "a willful
    falling away from, or rebellion against,

    Apostasy is the rejection of Christ by one
    who has been a Christian...."

    "Apostasy is a theological category
    describing those who have voluntarily and

    as well as a channel for God's grace

Protestantism
    A form of Christianity that originated
    with the 16th-century Reformation, a
    movement against what its followers
    perceived to be errors in the Catholic
    Church.

    A branch of Christian theology which is
    the study of sin, describes sin as an act
    of offence against God by despising his

    as being "same in essence" with the Father
    and the Son.

    The key term of the Christological
    doctrine formulated at the first
    ecumenical council, held at Nicaea in 325,
    to affirm that God the Son and God the
    Father are of the same substance.

sola fide
    [doctrine]

    Justificatio sola fide, meaning
    justification by faith alone, is a
    soteriological doctrine in Christian
    theology commonly held to distinguish the
    Lutheran and Reformed traditions of
    Protestantism, among others, from the
    Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, Oriental
    Orthodox and Assyrian churches.

sola gratia

solus Christus

soli Deo gloria

sola scriptura
    [doctrine]

    Meaning by scripture alone, is a Christian
    theological doctrine held by most
    Protestant Christian denominations, in
    particular the Lutheran and Reformed
    traditions of Protestantism, that posits
    the Bible as the sole infallible source of
    authority for Christian faith and
    practice.

    The Catholic Church considers it heterodox
    and generally the Orthodox churches
    consider it to be contrary to the
    'phronema' of the Church.

    While the scriptures' meaning is mediated
    through many kinds of subordinate
    authority—such as the ordinary teaching
    offices of a church, the ecumenical
    creeds, councils of the Catholic Church,
    or even personal special revelation—sola
    scriptura in contrast rejects any
    infallible authority other than the Bible.

    In this view, all non-scriptural authority
    is derived from the authority of the
    scriptures or is independent of the
    scriptures, and is, therefore, subject to
    reform when compared to the teaching of
    the Bible.

    Sola scriptura is a formal principle of
    many Protestant Christian denominations,
    and one of the five solae.

    It was a foundational doctrinal principle
    of the Protestant Reformation held by many
    of the Reformers, who taught that
    authentication of Scripture is governed by
    the discernible excellence of the text, as
    well as the personal witness of the Holy
    Spirit to the heart of each man.

    Some evangelical and Baptist denominations
    state the doctrine of sola scriptura more
    strongly: Scripture is self-
    authenticating, clear (perspicuous) to the
    rational reader, its own interpreter
    ("Scripture interprets Scripture"), and
    sufficient of itself to be the final
    authority of Christian doctrine.

    By contrast, the Protestant traditions of
    Anglicanism, Methodism and Pentecostalism
    uphold the doctrine of prima scriptura,
    with scripture being illumined by
    tradition and reason.

typology
typological symbolism
    A Christian form of biblical
    interpretation that proceeds on the
    assumption that God placed anticipations

       savior.

       It was I who knew you in the
       wilderness, in the land of drought; but
       when they had grazed, they became full,
       they were filled, and their heart was

        today, lest, when you have eaten and

        and terrifying wilderness, with its
        fiery serpents and scorpions and
