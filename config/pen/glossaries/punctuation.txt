        graphic design.

        company was losing over a million

        the company any more money.

        The new store will have groceries on
        the lower level; luggage, housewares,
        and electronics on the ground floor;
        men’s and women’s clothing on the
        second floor; and books, music, and
        stationery on the third floor. 

    In elliptical constructions:
        Some people brought food; others,
        clothing; yet others, merely a
        willingness to help.
