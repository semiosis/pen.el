Lumens
lm

    light (to the human eye) from a lamp or
    light source.

stigmatism
    The condition of an optical system (such
    as a lens or mirror) in which rays of
    light from a single point converge in a
    single focal point.

holography
hologram
    A technique that enables a wavefront to be
    recorded and later re-constructed.

    Holography is best known as a method of
    generating three-dimensional images, but
    it also has a wide range of other
    applications.

    In principle, it is possible to make a
    hologram for any type of wave.

    A hologram is made by superimposing a
    second wavefront (normally called the
    reference beam) on the wavefront of
    interest, thereby generating an
    interference pattern which is recorded on
    a physical medium.

    When only the second wavefront illuminates
    the interference pattern, it is diffracted
    to recreate the original wavefront.

    Holograms can also be computer-generated
    by modelling the two wavefronts and adding
    them together digitally.

    The resulting digital image is then
    printed onto a suitable mask or film and
    illuminated by a suitable source to
    reconstruct the wavefront of interest.

    Holography is a photographic technique
    that records the light scattered from an
    object, and then presents it in a way that
    appears three-dimensional.

    Holograms pop up in movies such as "Star
    Wars" and "Iron Man," but the technology
    has not quite caught up to movie magic —
    yet.

albedo
    The proportion of the incident light or
    radiation that is reflected by a surface,
    typically that of a planet or moon.

wavefront
    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wavefront

    In physics, the wavefront of a time-
    varying field is the set (locus) of all
    points where the wave has the same phase
    of the sinusoid.

    The term is generally meaningful only for
    fields that, at each point, vary
    sinusoidally in time with a single
    temporal frequency (otherwise the phase is
    not well defined).

    Wavefronts usually move with time.

    For waves propagating in an unidimensional
    medium, the wavefronts are usually single
    points; they are curves in a two
    dimensional medium, and surfaces in a
    three-dimensional one.

    A wave front is defined as a surface over
    which the phase of the wave is constant.

    In a particular wave front, at a given
    moment of time, all particles of the
    medium are undergoing the same motion.

    Two types of wave fronts are particularly
    important.

    They are plane wave fronts and spherical
    wave fronts.

phase
out of phase
    A definition of the position of a point in
    time (instant) on a waveform cycle.

    Phase can also be an expression of
    relative displacement between or among
    waves having the same frequency .

    Phase is the same frequency, same cycle,
    same wavelength, but are 2 or more wave
    forms not exactly aligned together.

    "Phase is not a property of just one RF
    signal but instead involves the
    relationship between two or more signals
    that share the same frequency.

    Below is an example of 2 wave forms 90
    degree out of phase.

Abbe-Number
    Also known as Abbe constant, it inversely
    quantifies the amount of dispersion in an
    optical medium.
    
    It is given by a function of the
    refractive index of a material at the f
    (486.1nm), d (587.6nm), and c (656.3nm)
    wavelengths.
    
    A material with a high Abbe number means
    that the different wavelengths will have
    nearly the same index of refraction in
    that medium, yielding less separation
    between wavelengths of light.

Charge-Coupled Device (CCD)
    Silicon chip containing an array of
    photosensitive sites.
    
    The imaging area consists of rows and
    columns of photosensitive pixels that
    accumulate and store electric charge.
    
    The term CCD refers to the way the
    photoelectron packets are moved around on
    the chip, the shift registers.
    
    Each column is separated by a shift
    register, to which pixel charge is
    transferred.
    
    Charge is read out from each pixel of the
    device through the shift register
    sequentially to an amplifier.
    
    The raw analog signal is either used
    directly, or quantized by an A/D
    converter.

Circular Polarizer
    A polarizing component that uses a linear
    polarizer in combination with a retarder
    (waveplate).
    
    The retarder is used to introduce a wave
    shift between the orthogonal components of
    the polarized light.
    
    In this way, two equal components of light
    oscillating perpendicular to each other
    with a relative phase difference add as
    vectors to yield a rotating linear
    polarization state.
    
    If the amplitude components of the
    orthogonal states are not equal, the
    vector addition of the two components will
    produce an elliptical polarization.
    
    For this reason, the linearly polarized
    light is input into the retarder at 45° to
    the fast axis to ensure that both
    components are of equal amplitude.

Coherent Light
    With respect to lasers, the amplifying
    laser medium produces coherent light
    because the process of stimulated emission
    produces additional photons with the same
    phase as the originator.
    
    Noise within the laser output is the
    result of spontaneous emissions which do
    not have the same characteristics as the
    stimulated emission.
    
    During oscillation, the spontaneous
    emission component will also be amplified
    and appear in the output as random noise.

    Outside surfaces have an anti-reflection
    coating to reduce back reflections.
    
    No beam displacement occurs between the
    original and separated beams.
    
    The reflected and transmitted beams travel
    through the same amount of glass, so
    although the optical path length of each
    arm is increased, both paths are increased
    by the same amount.
    
    Their cubic shape makes cube beamsplitters
    easy to mount, thus suffering less from
    deformation due to mechanical stress.

Electronic Shutter
    Controls the amount of time a camera
    collects light or charge during each
    frame, also known as the exposure time.
    
    Standard signal formats employ
    approximately 60 frames per second (fps),
    indicating a collecting charge of 1/60
    seconds for each frame.
    
    As light levels increase the sensor
    overfills with charge, resulting in

    Electronic shuttering circuits prevent
    these effects by allowing the sensor to
    collect charge for a shorter period during
    each frame.

    collect charge for a shorter period during
    each frame.

    at distances shorter than the minimum
    focusing range, it's spot size will be
    larger than the focused spot at this
    minimum distance.
    
    It is important to note that the focused

    response.
    
    Displays, however, can have a nonlinear
    response corresponding to gamma values

    When used together the camera may
    incorporate gamma correction to linearize
    the resulting system.

Interference Filter
    A type of filter made up of several
    metallic or dielectric layers of material,
    typically composing a three-cavity design.
    
    The correct combination yields high
    spectral transmittance over very narrow
    wavelength ranges due to interference
    effects between layers.

Interference Fringe
    Alternating light and dark bands in an
    intensity pattern due to the wave nature
    of light.
    
    The phase difference remains constant
    along one fringe.
    
    When using an optical flat, straight,
    parallel, and evenly spaced interference
    fringes indicate that the work surface
    flatness is equal to or higher than that
    of the reference surface.

    Interlaced imaging devices produce images
    by scanning and reading out odd-numbered
    lines in the first pass, then even-
    numbered lines in the second pass, and so
    on.
    
    Two fields are assembled into one full
    frame.

Interline Transfer
    Also referred to as 2:1 interlaced video,
    it combines two fields to make up each
    video.
    
    If each field is scanned at 60Hz, the
    frame rate is necessarily 30Hz.

Ion-Beam Sputtering (IBS)
    A physical vapor depostition technique to
    increase the density of thin-film
    coatings, thus creating "hard coated"
    filters.
    
    The thin film is deposited by sputtering
    (ejecting) material from a target by ion
    bombardment which is then deposited onto
    the filter substrate.

Iris Diaphragm
    A mechanical aperture designed to smoothly
    change the aperture size.
    
    It can be used to control the amount of
    light entering an optical system if used
    as the aperture stop.

    Denoted by E, it is the incident power per
    unit area, measured in W/m2.
    
    Also known as radiant flux density.

Irregularity
    A type of surface accuracy specification
    that describes how the shape of a surface
    deviates from the shape of a reference
    surface.
    
    Regularity refers to the sphericity of the
    circular fringes that are formed from the
    comparison of the test surface to the
    reference surface.
    
    When the power of a surface is more than 5
    fringes, it is difficult to detect small
    irregularities of less than 1 fringe.
    
    So surfaces are specified with a ratio of
    power to irregularity of approximately
    5:1.

Jitter
    An imaging phenomenon that limits the
    accuracy of measurement to at least two
    pixel separations because signals
    impinging on the sensor may fall on a
    pixel or on the space between pixels.
    
    Statistically speaking, the latter case
    may cause a response in the pixel to the
    immediate left or the immediate right of
    the space.
    
    Due to the standard scan frequency of
    60Hz, such a static image will exhibit
    jitter between the two pixels in question
    over time.

    crystal with attached electrodes used to
    modulate a laser beam.
    
    A phase delay of a laser transmitting
    through the crystal is modulated by
    applying a variable electric voltage,
    causing birefringence.
    
    The change is proportional to the square
    of the field, which is known as the Kerr
    effect.

    amplification by stimulated emission of
    radiation.
    
    The basic structure is based on an active
    medium (either a gas or semiconductor)
    contained between two reflectors.
    
    A laser's reflectors contain light by
    oscillating it through a medium repeatedly
    allowing the energy to build up with each
    pass.
    
    Laser radiation escapes due to a partially
    reflecting mirror in the assembly.

    that a surface can withstand before it is
    damaged.
    
    For pulsed lasers, typically measured in
    mJ/cm2; for continuous wave lasers,
    typically in W/cm2.
    
    This measurement is very important for
    mirrors or any other optical component
    used in conjunction with laser products.

Littrow Dispersion Prism
    Also known as a 30-60-90 dispersion prism,
    it is available in two versions: uncoated
    and coated.
    
    An uncoated Littrow dispersion prism
    disperses white light into its spectral
    components, similar to an equilateral
    prism; a coated Littrow dispersion prism
    deviates the ray path by 60° without
    inverting or reverting the image.
    
    The hypotenuse of the coated version is at
    Brewster's angle for 514.5nm, resulting in
    retroreflection at that wavelength.
    
    Rotating the prism changes the
    retroreflected wavelength and makes this
    prism suitable for line selection in a
    laser.

    See also:
    - Dispersion

Longitudinal Chromatic Aberration (LCA)
    A type of chromatic aberration where
    different wavelengths focus at different
    points along the horizontal optical axis
    as a result of dispersion properties of
    the glass.
    
    The refractive index of a glass is
    wavelength dependent, so it has a slightly
    different effect on where each wavelength
    of light focuses, resulting in separate
    focal points for red, yellow, and blue
    light along a horizontal plane.

    See also:
    - Transverse Chromatic Aberration (TCA)
    - Aberration
    - Chromatic Focal Shift

Longitudinal Mode Spacing
    The spacing between multiple frequencies
    of oscillation within a laser that results
    from a combination of the gain curve for a
    laser and the resonance characteristics of
    its cavity.
    
    Since the mode spacing is defined as the
    speed of light divided by twice the cavity
    length, short cavities can be used in
    applications that require a minimal
    frequency spread.
    
    A short cavity can extend the mode spacing
    such that only one frequency experiences
    gain during oscillation.

    - Spatial Mode
    - Laser

Longpass Filter

    band is a higher wavelength region as
    compared to the region blocked

    See also:
    - Shortpass Filter

Louver Angle
    For light control film, the angle
    orientation of the closely spaced micro-
    louvers.
    
    The louvers simulate a tiny venetian blind
    that blocks out unwanted ambient light and
    controls the direction of display light.
    
    Unlike blinds, the film is a solid
    material.

Magneto-Rheological Finishing (MRF)
    Deterministic process using a precise
    interferometrically documented sub
    aperture tool to correct waveform errors
    by selectively removing material under a
    controlled and predicted process.
    
    It provides high performance finishing in
    less time than standard polishing
    techniques because of its precise control
    of the removal location and high removal
    rate.

Magnification
    Optical and imaging magnification is a
    ratio of image angular subtense to object
    angular subtense.
    
    Electronic, or linear, magnification is
    the ratio of monitor size to sensor size.
    
    For example, 13" monitors are between 38
    and 39 times as large as ½" size format
    sensor cameras when comparing horizontal,
    vertical, or diagonal measures.

Marginal Ray
    In geometric optics, the marginal ray of
    an optical system determines the paraxial
    image location, and hits the edge of all
    pupils in the optical system.
    
    Along with the chief ray, it describes the
    entire paraxial image.

    - Chief Ray

Meniscus Lens
    A type of singlet lens with one convex
    (outwardly curved) surface and the other

    Deviations in the surface form of an
    optical surface relative to its ideal
    shape at higher spatial frequencies than
    Zernike polynomial aberrations but lower
    frequencies than surface roughness.
    
    The mid-spatial frequency range is defined
    somewhat ambiguously as the region which
    causes optical blur or image degradation
    in optical systems.
    
    These errors must be controlled for during
    optical manufacturing, particularly when
    fabricating aspheric lenses.

    signal is varied through the use of a
    mechanical or electronic chopper, also
    called chopping frequency.

Modulation Transfer Function (MTF)
    A measure of contrast as a function of
    spatial frequency.
    
    Defined as 100% at zero-frequency, MTF
    continuously declines with increasing
    spatial frequency to zero contrast at a
    theoretical maximum resolution frequency
    defined by the diffraction limit of the
    optical system.

Moment Load
    The forces that are offset (cantilevered)
    from the bearing centers of mechanical
    components producing uneven loading on the
    bearings.
    
    Uneven loading means that some bearings
    are supporting more of the load than
    others.
    
    Moment forces are categorized by the
    direction in which they act: pitch, roll
    or yaw.
    
    When loading results in moments acting in
    only one of the moment directions, it is
    called a single direction moment.
    
    If it is in more than one direction, it is
    referred to as compound moment loading.

    - Polarization
    - Beamsplitter

Normal Load Capacity
    The maximum downward (compression) load or
    force that can be applied to a mechanical
    component perpendicular to the mounting
    surface.
    
    The center of force, or the center of
    gravity, of the load must be located in
    the center of the mounting surface.

    See also:
    - Inverted Load Capacity
    - Moment Load

Notch Filter
    A type of filter designed to block a pre-
    selected bandwidth while transmitting all
    other wavelengths within the design range
    of the filter.
    
    Manufactured using the dielectric stack
    method, which uses a series of thin layers
    of dielectric materials of alternating
    refractive index.

Nth Order
    Multiple combinations of wavelength and
    integer order values that will satisfy any
    given groove spacing, angle of incidence,
    and diffracted angle calculated from the
    grating equation.
    
    Gratings are generally specified in terms
    of first order diffraction since
    efficiency decreases with higher orders.

Numerical Aperture (NA)
    The sine of the vertex angle of the
    largest cone of meridional rays that can
    enter or exit an optical system.

Optical Fiber
    A type of optic comprised of a core
    surrounded by a relatively thin cladding
    layer of lower index material.
    
    This geometry causes internal reflection
    of light inside the fiber and defines the
    maximum angles accepted by the fiber.
    
    An optical fiber emits into a cone of
    equal angle, not as a beam of light.
    
    Coherent fiber bundles can relay images
    from one end to the other; whereas,
    incoherent bundles are used for
    propagation of light alone.

    designers to determine various values
    without having to completely ray trace a
    system.
    
    It is obtained by comparing two rays
    within a system at any axial point.
    
    It is constant for any two rays at every
    point in the system.
    
    In other words, if the invariant for a set
    of two rays is known, ray trace one of the
    rays and then scale that by the invariant
    to find the second.

    See also:
    - Lagrange Invariant

Optical Path Difference
    For a perfect optical system, the optical
    path, or distance, from an object point to
    a corresponding image point will be equal
    for all rays.
    
    In near-perfect systems, slight
    differences will exist between rays
    resulting in an optical path difference,
    usually expressed in fractions of the
    wavelength being analyzed.

Oscilloscope
    A system in which a supplied signal causes
    the deflection of the electron beam in a
    cathode-ray tube, thus forming a visible
    trace on the phosphor screen of the tube,
    allowing for examination of signal
    characteristics.

    See also:
    - Cathode Ray Tube

Output Power
    The power measured at the exit of a laser
    cavity, commonly expressed as minimum
    output or maximum output.
    
    The class designation of a laser is based
    in part upon this characteristic.

Packing Fraction
    Considering a cross-section of an optical
    fiber bundle, it is the ratio of the area
    of the fibers to the space between the
    fibers.
    
    Bundles comprised of smaller individual
    fibers have larger packing fractions.

    See also:
    - Optical Fiber

    change in magnification of an object with
    distance from a lens, making objects
    farther away seem smaller than those close
    up.

Parallelism
    The specification for the deviation in
    alignment of an optical surface relative
    to another; it causes angular deviation in
    optical or mechanical systems.

Paraxial
    In geometric optics, the design paradigm
    in which small-angle approximations (e.g.
    
    Sinθ=θ) remain accurate.

Paraxial Rays
    The small bundle of rays that travel
    through an optical system on- or nearly
    on-axis.
    
    They are useful for first-order
    approximations and for defining basic
    system parameters.

    See also:
    - Marginal Ray

    reflection from a surface or refraction
    through the surface.

    passed by a filter.

    See also:
    - Filter

Peak Wavelength
    The wavelength of light that has the
    highest transmittance value.

Pellicle Beamsplitter
    A type of beamsplitter constructed of an
    ultra-thin nitrocellulose membrane bonded
    to the lapped edge of an aluminum ring.
    
    It neither adds distance to the optical
    path length, nor creates ghost images due
    to back reflections.
    
    Although a pellicle beamsplitter is more
    sensitive to vibrations than a standard
    glass substrate beamsplitter, it does not
    add chromatic aberration or induce a focal
    shift.

    See also:
    - Beamsplitter
    - Chromatic Focal Shift

Penta Prism
    A five-sided prism that deviates the ray
    path by 90°.
    
    Since incident light rays are reflected
    twice to achieve a right angle turn, the
    image from a penta prism is of the same
    orientation as the object.
    
    It is useful for shortening the length of
    an assembly.

Periplan Eyepiece
    An eyepiece consisting of one achromatic
    doublet plus one plano-convex lens (plano

    react if exposed to light.

Photovoltaic Effect
    Light with enough energy excites electrons
    from the valence to the conduction band,
    creating a difference in electric
    potential.
    
    This allows detectors to transform light
    energy into an electrical current.

Pitch
    In relation to movement, it is the angular
    rotation about the lateral axis, typically
    the Y-axis for X-Y-Z configurations.
    
    In relation to mechanical components, it
    is the spacing between consecutive threads
    on a threaded part.
    
    It is the inverse of TPI.

Pixel
    Photosites, or potential wells, on a
    camera sensor.
    
    In a CCD, each pixel's charge is converted
    to voltage, buffered, and transferred
    through a single node as an analog signal.
    
    In a CMOS sensor, the charge-to-voltage
    conversion is done at the pixel level.

Pixel Clock
    In a CCD camera sensor, it describes the
    speed of the complementary signals which
    are used to move the charge packets
    through the shift registers towards the
    read out amplifiers.
    
    This determines how long it takes to read
    out the entire sensor, but it is also
    limited by noise and spillover issues
    which occur when the packets are
    transferred too quickly.

    - Pixel Depth

Pixel Depth
    Often referred to as grayscale, the pixel
    depth represents the number of steps of
    gray in the image.
    
    It is closely related to the minimum
    amount of contrast detectable by a sensor.

    electric field, which is known as the
    Pockels effect.
    
    See also Kerr Cell

    the propagating axis (where the laser
    light is pointing) and the mechanical axis

Polarization
    A property arising from the wave nature of
    light.
    
    Polarized light consists of waves which
    oscillate in a defined and predictable
    manner.
    
    The direction in which the electric field
    vector points as it propagates through
    space defines the polarization state.
    
    If it oscillates in a single plane, the
    polarization state is linear.
    
    If it rotates about the axis of
    propagation, the polarization state is
    elliptical or circular.

    of the dispersion about the mean value for
    a large number of positioning trials.

Power
    A type of surface accuracy specification
    that applies to curved optical surfaces.
    
    It is tested by comparing a curved surface
    against a reference surface with a highly
    calibrated radius of curvature.
    
    Using the same principle of interference
    caused by the air gaps between the two
    surfaces, the interferences pattern of
    fringes is used to describe the deviation
    of the test surface from the reference
    surface.
    
    A deviation from the reference piece will
    create a series of rings, known as
    Newton’s Rings.

    The plane of incidence is normal to the
    surface or interface upon which light is
    incident.

    refractive index of solids and liquids.

Relative Brightness
    A figure of merit corresponding to the
    amount of light seen by a viewer through
    binoculars, obtained by squaring the
    diameter of the exit pupil in millimeters.
    
    A higher number indicates a brighter image
    in low-light situations.

Relative Efficiency
    Also referred to as groove efficiency of
    diffraction gratings, it expresses the
    energy diffracted into the required order
    as compared to the efficiency of the
    coating itself at the same wavelength.
    
    For example, a grating that yields 40%
    diffraction into a specific order at 500nm
    compared to a mirror with the same coating
    that reflects 80% of light at 500nm would
    have a relative efficiency of 50%.
    
    Theoretically, the relative efficiency for
    a grating can appear very high, yet, the
    actual piece could yield very low
    diffraction into the desired order if the
    coating reflectivity is low at the
    wavelength region of interest.

    of incoming polarized light.

    See also:
    - Retarder (Waveplate)

Retarder (Waveplate)
    A class of materials that exhibit the
    characteristic of birefringence.
    
    Orthogonal components of light that enter
    a retarder (or waveplate) will experience
    a relative phase shift upon output.
    
    This phase shift is dependent upon the
    thickness of the retarding medium and the
    degree of birefringence.
    
    The axes of the material exhibit different
    index characteristics and are generally
    referred to as the fast (low index) and
    slow (high index) axes.

    and can have a wide variety of lines,
    circles, or patterns either etched or
    chrome deposited on it.
    
    Microscope eyepieces accept reticles while
    magnifiers or comparators accept contact
    reticles; the former must be placed close
    to the eye or sensor, whereas, the latter
    close to the object under inspection.

Retroreflector
    An optical component designed to reflect
    light back in the direction from which it
    originated.

    that is not consistent with the radiation
    signal.

Rotating Focusing Mechanism
    A mechanical method of adjusting the focus
    of an optical assembly, such as an imaging
    lens or laser beam expander, in which
    optical components are rotated during
    translation.
    
    Rotating focusing mechanisms are simple
    and inexpensive, but they can suffer from
    image runout or beam wander due to the
    rotation of the elements.
    
    Sliding focusing mechanisms, which
    translate optical elements without
    rotation, reduce image runout and beam
    wander but are typically more expensive
    due to their more complicated mechanics.
    
    Threaded focusing tubes are a common type
    of rotating focusing mechanism.

Rugate Notch Filter
    A type of notch filter constructed with a
    single layer of thin film in which the

    a coating, an epoxy layer, and polished
    substrate onto the master.
    
    Although the gratings are generally cut
    from larger pieces and have grooves across
    the entire face, incident light should be
    confined to 90% of the full face during
    use.

    Corresponds to the "exposure time" of the
    sensor chip that controls the amount of
    light incident on it.

Signal Format
    The standardization of transmission and
    reception of analog signals, typically
    determined by geographical region.
    
    Signal parameters include synchronization,
    number of scanlines, bandwidth, black and
    blanking levels, frame rate, aspect ratio,
    etc.
    
    Video components of one signal format are
    not compatible with those of another.

Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR)
    Comparison of signal power to noise power,
    including dark current and other
    unwanted/unpredictable fluctuations.
    
    In imaging systems, it is expressed in
    decibel values for analog systems, and
    "bit" values for digital systems.
    
    Industrial cameras have no less than 46dB
    SNR, yielding 256 steps of contrast in the
    image.
    
    This corresponds to an 8 bit digital
    signal (28 = 256).
    
    Every 6dB of an analog signal converts to
    1 bit when digitized.

Sliding Focusing Mechanism
    Mechanical method of changing the focus of
    an optical assembly, such as a laser beam
    expander or imaging lens, in which optical
    components are not rotated during
    translation, which minimizes beam wander
    and image runout.
    
    However, this requires more complex
    mechanics than rotating focusing
    mechanisms, which rotate the optical
    elements during translation, typically
    increasing the cost of sliding focusing
    mechanisms.
    
    Helicoid barrels are a common type of
    sliding focusing mechanism.

    (crystalline or glass) as the active
    medium, doped to provide the energy states
    necessary for lasing.
    
    The pumping mechanism is the radiation
    from a powerful light source, such as a
    flash lamp.

Spatial Filter
    An assembly that is used in conjunction
    with laser applications to eliminate
    spatial noise.
    
    A pinhole is used to select only the
    central peak of the intensity pattern from
    a focused spot.
    
    The size of the pinhole is selected based
    upon the wavelength, objective focal
    length, and input beam diameter.

Spatial Frequency
    Method of quantifying object size by a
    density (e.g.
    
    linepairs per millimeter) rather than a
    size.
    
    Allows for more precise way of describing
    resolution as it considers the necessary
    space between defects that allows for
    their detection, as well as describing
    lens performance by way of a transfer
    function.

Spatial Mode
    The configurations of energy storage,
    relative to the structure of a laser
    resonator, that define the relative
    intensity distribution of the laser beam.

    light rays from the outer portion of a
    lens focus either in front of
    (undercorrected) or behind (overcorrected)
    the focus point of the rays from the
    center portion of the lens.
    
    Unlike most other monochromatic
    aberrations, spherical aberration appears
    on-axis as well as off-axis.

S-Polarization
    The linear polarization state which is
    perpendicular to the plane of incidence.
    
    The plane of incidence is normal to the
    surface or interface upon which light is
    incident.
    
    If the light is incident upon the
    interface at an angle, the light will be
    oscillating in such a way as to appear to
    be “skipping” across the surface.

Straight Line Accuracy
    For ball bearing stages, it denotes error
    in the horizontal plane (left and right
    movement in direction of travel).

Straightness
    A measure of linear deviation in a
    translation stage in the two axes other
    than the direction of travel.
    
    It can be thought of as unintended linear
    travel in the two axes other than the
    direction of travel.

Stray Light
    Energy outside of the field of view of an
    optical system that scatters off of the
    edges of an optical or mechanical
    component and reaches the sensor in the
    form of background noise.
    
    This can decrease an image's contrast by
    lightening the background.

Strehl Ratio

    of an aberrated diffraction pattern to
    that at the peak of an aberration-free
    system.

    calculate stress birefringence that
    depends on glass type, wavelength and
    temperature.

Surface Accuracy
    An indication of the peak-to-valley
    flatness of a surface given in terms of
    waves (a multiple or part of a reference
    wavelength).
    
    For example, a specification of 1/4 wave
    means that the flatness of the surface
    deviates by one quarter of the wavelength
    used to test the surface.
    
    If the wavelength was 550nm, the flatness
    would be held to within 140nm in order to
    produce a surface accuracy of 1/4 wave.
    
    Also given in RMS (root mean squared)
    where the peak-to-valley values are
    squared and then the square root is taken
    of their mean.

    See also:
    - Reference Wavelength

Surface Flatness
    A type of surface accuracy specification
    that measures the deviation of a flat
    surface such as that of a mirror, window,
    prism, or plano-lens.
    
    This deviation can be measured using an
    optical flat.
    
    The deviations in flatness are often
    measured in values of waves (λ), which are
    multiples of the wavelength of the testing
    source.
    
    One fringe corresponds to ½ of a wave.
    
    1λ flatness is considered typical grade,
    λ/4 flatness is considered to be precision
    grade, and λ/20 is considered high
    precision grade.

    - Optical Flat

Surface Quality
    A specification of allowable flaws in the
    surface on an optic indicated by a
    hyphenated number (i.e.
    
    60-40).
    
    The first number is referred to as the
    scratch number and quantifies defects of a
    long nature, such as scratches; the second
    number is the dig number and indicates
    round defects such as pits and dents.
    
    Scratch-Dig numbers for surface quality
    conform to the US government standards
    MIL-PRF-13830B.

Surface Roughness (Surface Finish)
    Surface roughness, or high frequency
    error, is a measure of smoothness, or the
    quality of the polish on an optic’s
    surface.
    
    Surface roughness can effect scatter and
    the ability to withstand high laser power
    on the surface.
    
    They are usually an unfortunate by-product
    of the polishing process.
    
    Rough surfaces tend to wear faster than
    smooth surfaces and may not be suitable
    for some applications, especially those
    with lasers or intense heat, due to
    possible nucleation sites that can appear
    in small cracks or imperfections.
    
    Manufacturing tolerances for surface
    finish range from 50Å RMS for typical
    quality, 20Å RMS for precision quality,
    and 5Å RMS for high quality.

Tangent Arm Drive
    A type of drive mechanism for rotary
    stages in which angular rotation is
    controlled by three knobs.
    
    The release knob disengages the shaft from
    the drive, freeing the stage to be rotated
    by hand to a desired location.
    
    The release knob is then tightened to re-
    engage the drive mechanism and transfer
    control to the adjustment knob which, when
    rotated, produces precise angular
    positioning of the shaft and stage top.

Tangential Plane
    The component of the spot (or ray bundle)
    that lies parallel to the tangent line of
    a circle in the z-plane with diameter of

    A type of imaging lens in which the exit
    pupil is located at infinity.

    working distances there is no viewing
    angle error or magnification error
    associated with features in the image that
    are at different heights or angles.

    See also:
    - Magnification

Telecentricity
    The ability of a lens to maintain a
    constant magnification under changes in
    working distance.
    
    Quantified by the maximum angular
    deviation of a chief ray from parallel to
    the optical axis.

Tempered Glass
    Glass that is heat treated after
    fabrication in order to make it more
    durable and resistant to heat and thermal
    shock.
    
    Since heat absorbing filters are placed in
    front of intense light sources, they are
    typically tempered to increase their
    resistance to breaking.

Threshold Current
    The minimum driving current corresponding
    to lasing threshold at a specified
    temperature.

    See also:
    - Dark Current

Throughput
    Determines the light collecting efficiency
    of a lens or optical system.
    
    High throughput means high transmitted
    intensity while low throughput means low
    transmitted intensity.

Thrust Capacity
    For ball bearing stages, the maximum force
    or load that can be applied in the
    direction of travel without damage to
    positioning stage components.
    
    The mounting surface (stage carriage) is
    pressed against the drive mechanism by
    means of a spring.
    
    As a result, the maximum thrust which the
    stage assembly can maintain is different
    when pressing towards the spring versus
    away from it.
    
    When pressing towards the spring, the
    force is taken up by the drive mechanism
    (i.e.
    
    micrometer).
    
    While pulling away, the force is being
    held in place by the spring.
    
    It is specified as Ta and Tb: Ta refers to
    the load capacity against the micrometer
    and Tb is the spring load capacity.

Time Delay Integration (TDI)
    A type of line scanning where multiple
    linear arrays are placed side by side.
    
    After the first array is exposed, the
    charge is transferred to the neighboring
    line.
    
    When the object moves the distance of the
    separation between lines, a second
    exposure is taken on top of the first, and
    so on.
    
    Thus, each line of the object is imaged
    repeatedly, and the exposures are added to
    each other.

T-Mount
    In terms of mechanical components, it is a
    mounting thread denoted by M42 x 0.75mm.
    
    T-mount components have a 42mm diameter
    screw thread and a 0.75mm thread pitch;
    the outer diameter is 48mm.
    
    In terms of imaging, it is commonly called
    a T2 thread or simply denoted by M42 x
    0.75mm.
    
    The flange distance varies.

Transformation Temperature (Tg)
    The temperature at which glass changes
    from brittle to viscous-liquid due to
    thermal stress.
    
    Within a well-defined operating
    temperature, glass does not undergo major
    changes to its mechanical structure;
    however, after a specific transformation
    temperature, it will deform to the point
    where its original optical properties no
    longer apply.

Transistor-Transistor Logic (TTL)
    Refers to a common digital logic family of
    devices used for control in most modern
    electronics.
    
    TTL signals have two distinct states;
    "low" and "high." A logic "low"
    corresponds to a maximum voltage threshold
    of 0.8V; a "high" corresponds to a voltage
    greater than 2.5V.

    The wavelength interval of the
    electromagnetic spectrum that corresponds
    to ultraviolet light (light that is beyond
