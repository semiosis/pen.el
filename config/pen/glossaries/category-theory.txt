morphism
    A structure-preserving map from one
    mathematical structure to another one of
    the same type.
    
    The notion of morphism recurs in much of
    contemporary mathematics.

Category theory
    Formalizes mathematical structure and its
    concepts in terms of a labeled directed
    graph called a category, whose nodes are
    called objects, and whose labelled
    directed edges are called arrows.

    The algebraic theory of the "types" and
    "functions" you find in any typed formal
    languauge.

    Officially, category theory calls the
    types "objects" and functions "morphisms"
    so as to avoid treading on the
    set-theoretic toes of the traditionalists,
    but increasingly I see category theorists
    throwing such caution to the wind and
    using the more intuitive terms:
    - "type" and
    - "function"

coherence condition
    [#category theory]

    A collection of conditions requiring that
    various compositions of elementary
    morphisms are equal.
    
    Typically the elementary morphisms are
    part of the data of the category.

endofunctor
    [#category theory]

    A functor mapping a category to itself.

    A functor from one category back to the
    same category.
    
    It maps objects of the category to objects
    of the same category.
    
    The simplest example is the identity
    functor which maps every object inside a
    category back to itself; more interesting
    examples map objects to other objects in
    the same category.

category
    Any collection of objects that can relate
    to each other via morphisms in sensible
    ways, like composition and associativity.
    
    As Barry Mazur once remarked, this is a
    "template" for all of mathematics:
    depending on what you feed into the
    template, you'll recover one of the
    mathematical realms.
    
    So the collection of sets with functions
    forms a category, as does the collection
    of groups with group homomorphisms, and
    topological spaces with continuous
    functions.
    
    In addition to these, here are some other
    categories you're probably familiar with:

    | category name | its objects                   | its morphisms              |
    |---------------+-------------------------------+----------------------------|
    | set           | sets                          | functions                  |
    | group         | groups                        | group homomorphisms        |
    | top           | topological spaces            | continuous functions       |
    | vect_K        | vector spaces over a field, k | linear transformations     |
    | meas          | measurable spaces             | measurable functions       |
    | poset         | partially ordered sets        | order-preserving functions |
    | man           | smooth manifolds              | smooth maps                |
