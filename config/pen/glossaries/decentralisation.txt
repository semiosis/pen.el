IPFS
    IPFS allows users to host and receive
    content in a manner similar to BitTorrent.
    
    As opposed to a centrally located server,
    IPFS is built around a decentralized
    system of user-operators who hold a
    portion of the overall data, creating a
    resilient system of file storage and
    sharing.
    
    Any user in the network can serve a file
    by its content address, and other peers in
    the network can find and request that
    content from any node who has it using a
    distributed hash table (DHT).
    
    In contrast to BitTorrent, IPFS aims to
    create a single global network.
    
    This means that if two users publish a
    block of data with the same hash, the
    peers downloading the content from "user
    1" will also exchange data with the ones
    downloading it from "user 2".
    
    IPFS aims to replace protocols used for
    static webpage delivery by using gateways
    which are accessible with HTTP.
    
    Users may choose not to install an IPFS
    client on their device and instead use a
    public gateway.
    
    A list of these gateways is maintained on
    the IPFS GitHub page.
