isopsephy
isopsephism
    (/ˈaɪsəpˌsɛfi/; ἴσος isos meaning "equal"
    and ψῆφος psephos meaning "pebble")

    The practice of adding up the number
    values of the letters in a word to form a
    single number.
    
    The total number is then used as a
    metaphorical bridge to other words
    evaluating the equal number, which
    satisfies isos or "equal" in the term.
    
    The early Greeks used pebbles arranged in
    patterns to learn arithmetic and geometry,
    which corresponds to psephos or "pebble"
    and "counting" in the term.

    Isopsephy is related to gematria: the same
    practice using the Hebrew alphabet. 

Marcus
    The founder of the Marcosian Gnostic sect
    in the 2nd century AD.
    
    He was a disciple of Valentinus, with whom
    his system mainly agrees.
    
    His doctrines are almost exclusively known
    to us through a long polemic (i. 13–21) in
    Adversus Haereses, in which Irenaeus gives
    an account of his teaching and his school.
    
    Clement of Alexandria clearly knew of
    Marcus and actually used his number system
    (Stromata, VI, xvi), though without
    acknowledgement.

Christ
    [#Marcosian Gnostic] 

    Karpos pleromatos.

Demiurge
    [#Marcosian Gnostic] 

    Karpos hysterematos.

hysterema
    The usual antithesis to Pleroma is not
    Kenoma, but Hysterema (ὑστέρημα).
    
    As the system is reported by Hippolytus
    (vi. 31, p. 180) this word is used as the
    complement of the word Pleroma, denoting
    all that is not included in the meaning of
    the latter word.
    
    Thus the Horos or boundary is described as
    separating the Hysterema from the Pleroma,
    itself partaking of the nature of both;
    but preserving all inside fixed and
    immovable by permitting nothing from
    without to enter.
    
    We can understand in the same sense the
    passage in Epiphanius (Haer. 31, 4, p.
    166), where the same name is given to the
    Demiurge; for it appears in the case of
    the word Hebdomas that the Valentinians
    gave to the Demiurge the name of the realm
    over which he ruled, and from which he had
    his origin.
    
    Marcus speaks of the Demiurge as karpos
    hysterematos probably, as Lightfoot
    suggests, in contrast with the description
    of the Christ as karpos pleromatos.
