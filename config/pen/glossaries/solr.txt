Solr
    Solr is a Web Service (REST) that provides
    applications API access to create and
    manage search indices (Collections) that
    behave like a NoSQL storage for Documents
    with Fields.
    
    The data saved in a collection of Solr
    documents can be queried using a variety
    of query syntaxes, most commonly the
    Lucene query syntax, or later dismax, or
    edismax.
    
    Solr's web server based on Jetty wraps the
    Lucene API with a web service so that
    developers and applications don't need to
    do the housekeeping involved in managing
    the index files themselves.

    It's a lot like elasticsearch.
