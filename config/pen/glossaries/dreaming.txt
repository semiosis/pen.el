lucid dream
    A type of dream in which the dreamer
    becomes aware that they are dreaming.
    During a lucid dream, the dreamer may gain
    some amount of control over the dream
    characters, narrative, or environment;
    however, this is not actually necessary
    for a dream to be described as lucid.
