Quantum indeterminacy
    The apparent necessary incompleteness in
    the description of a physical system, that
    has become one of the characteristics of
    the standard description of quantum
    physics.

Quantum jump
    Atomic electron transition or a similar
    transition between quantum states, which
    is a scientific phenomenon.

    Apparently they're not instantaneous:

Quantum jump method
MCWF method
Monte Carlo wave function method
    [#computational physics]
    [technique]

    Used for simulating open quantum systems.

    Example:
        Approximate the density matrix of a
        two-level atom undergoing damped Rabi
        oscillations.
