Nondimensionalization
    The partial or full removal of physical
    dimensions from an equation involving
    physical quantities by a suitable
    substitution of variables.
    
    This technique can simplify and
    parameterize problems where measured units
    are involved.
    
    It is closely related to dimensional
    analysis.
