ontology
    [#information science]

    An explicit specification of a
    conceptualization.

    A set of concepts and categories in a
    subject area of domain that shows their
    properties and the relations between them.

    Encompasses a representation, formal
    naming and definition of the categories,
    properties and relations between the
    concepts, data and entities that
    substantiate one, many or all domains of
    discourse.
    
    More simply, an ontology is a way of
    showing the properties of a subject area
    and how they are related, by defining a
    set of concepts and categories that
    represent the subject.
    
    Every academic discipline or field creates
    ontologies to limit complexity and
    organize data into information and
    knowledge.
    
    New ontologies improve problem solving
    within that domain.
    
    Translating research papers within every
    field is a problem made easier when
    experts from different countries maintain
    a controlled vocabulary of jargon between
    each of their languages.
