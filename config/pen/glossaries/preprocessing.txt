data scrubbing
    [error correction technique]
    
    Uses a background task to periodically
    inspect main memory or storage for errors,
    then correct detected errors using
    redundant data in the form of different
    checksums or copies of data.

sparsity
    [#text mining]
    
    Huge matrices are created based on word
    frequencies with many cells having zero
    values.
    
    This problem is called sparsity and is
    minimized using various techniques.

m4
    [template engine]

    m4 copies its input (from files or
    standard input) to standard output.
    
    It checks each token (a name, a quoted
    string, or any single character that's not
    a part of either a name or a string) to
    see if it's the name of a macro.
    
    If so, the token is replaced by the
    macro's value, and then that text is
    pushed back onto the input to be
    rescanned.
    
    (If you're new to m4, this repeated
    scanning may surprise you, but it's one
    key to m4 s power.)
    
    Quoting text, like ` text', prevents
    expansion.
    
    m4 comes with a number of predefined
    macros, or you can write your own macros
    by calling the define() function.
    
    A macro can have multiple arguments-- up
    to 9 in original m4, and an unlimited
    number in GNU m4.
    
    Macro arguments are substituted before the
    resulting text is rescanned.
