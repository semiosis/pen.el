periphrasis
    [#linguistics]

    The use of one or more function words to
    express meaning that otherwise may be
    expressed by attaching an affix or clitic
    to a word.
    
    The resulting phrase includes two or more
    collocated words instead of one inflected
    word.

cognate
lexical cognate
    [#historical linguistics]

    Cognates are sets of words in different
    languages that have been inherited in
    direct descent from an etymological
    ancestor in a common parent language.

creole
    A creole language arises if a pidgin,
    developed by adults for use as a second
    language, becomes the native and primary
    language of their children.

preposition
    Literally, "pre-position" -- it's a word
    that expects another word to follow.

    A word such as after, in, to, on, and
    with.

    Prepositions are usually used in front of
    nouns or pronouns and they show the
    relationship between the noun or pronoun
    and other words in a sentence

adverb
    Like a decorator for a phrase.

    An adverb is a word that modifies a verb,
    adjective, determiner, clause,
    preposition, or sentence.

    Typically express manner, place, time,
    frequency, degree, level of certainty,
    etc., answering questions such as how?, in
    what way?, when?, where?, and to what
    extent?

Anaphoric
    An expression who's interpretation depends
    on its antecedent or postcedent.

    Anaphoric form of ‘-map’.

text world theory
    The basic premise is that human beings
    process and understand all discourse by
    constructing mental representations of it
    in their minds.
    
    Aims to provide the analytical tools
    necessary for the systematic examination
    and discussion of these mental
    representations, or text-worlds.

    https://textworldtheory.org/about/

foregrounding
    A concept in literary studies concerning
    making a linguistic utterance stand out
    from the surrounding linguistic context,
    from given literary traditions or from
    more general world knowledge.

deixis
    [#linguistics]

    The use of general words and phrases to
    refer to a specific time, place, or person
    in context, e.g., the words tomorrow,
    there, and they.
    
    Words are deictic if their semantic
    meaning is fixed but their denoted meaning
    varies depending on time and/or place.

constituent
syntactic analysis
    [#linguistics]

    A word or a group of words that function
    as a single unit within a hierarchical
    structure.
    
    The constituent structure of sentences is
    identified using tests for constituents.

clause
    [#language]

    A constituent that comprises a semantic
    predicand and a semantic predicate.
    
    A typical clause consists of a subject and
    a syntactic predicate, the latter
    typically a verb phrase composed of a verb
    with any objects and other modifiers.

    A unit of grammatical organization next
    below the sentence in rank and in
    traditional grammar said to consist of a
    subject and predicate.

    A particular and separate article,
    stipulation, or proviso in a treaty, bill,
    or contract.

subordinate clause
dependent clause
embedded clause
    A clause that is embedded within a complex
    sentence.
    
    For instance, in the English sentence "I
    know that Bette is a dolphin", the clause
    "that Bette is a dolphin" occurs as the
    complement of the verb "know" rather than
    as a freestanding sentence.

predicand
    [#semantics]

    An argument in an utterance, specifically
    that of which something is predicated.
    
    By extension, in syntax, it is the
    constituent in a clause typically
    functioning as the subject.

presupposition
    A thing tacitly assumed beforehand at the
    beginning of a line of argument or course
    of action.
    "both men shared certain ethical
    presuppositions about the universe"

    [#pragmatics]

    An implicit assumption about the world or
    background belief relating to an utterance
    whose truth is taken for granted in
    discourse.
    
    Example:
    - Jane no longer writes fiction.

semantic domain
    Some words have a 'narrow semantic
    domain', a very technical thing - such as
    a USB port.
    
    But some words have a 'broad semantic
    domain'.

interjection
    A word, phrase, or sentence that expresses
    emotion, meaning, or feeling.
    
    These emotion words proceed punctuation
    marks, which are most often but not always
    exclamation points.
    
    For example: Rats! My research paper is
    late!

disjunct
    [#linguistics]

    A type of adverbial adjunct that expresses
    information that is not considered
    essential to the sentence it appears in,
    but which is considered to be the
    speaker's or writer's attitude towards, or
    descriptive statement of, the
    propositional content of the sentence,
    "expressing, for example, the speaker's
    degree of truthfulness or his manner of
    speaking." A specific type of disjunct is
    the sentence adverb (or sentence
    adverbial), which modifies a sentence, or
    a clause within a sentence, to convey the
    mood, attitude or sentiments of the
    speaker, rather than an adverb modifying a
    verb, an adjective or another adverb
    within a sentence.
    
    More generally, the term disjunct can be
    used to refer to any sentence element that
    is not fully integrated into the clausal
    structure of the sentence.
    
    Such elements usually appear peripherally
    (at the beginning or end of the sentence)
    and are set off from the rest of the
    sentence by a comma (in writing) and a
    pause (in speech).

lexeme
    A unit of lexical meaning that underlies a
    set of words that are related through
    inflection. It is a basic abstract unit of
    meaning, a unit of morphological analysis
    in linguistics that roughly corresponds to
    a set of forms taken by a single root
    word.

synset
    A set of synonyms that represent a single
    sense of a word.

wordform
    The full inflected surface form.

    Example:
    "cat" and "cats" are different wordforms.

lemma
    The same stem, part of speech, rough word sense

    Example:
    "cat" and "cats" are the same lemma.

    One lemma can have many meanings.

    Example:
    a bank can hold investments...
    agriculture on the east bank...

sense
    A discrete representation of an aspect of
    a word's meaning.

    The usages of bank in the previous example
    have a different sense.

homonyms
    Words that share form but have unrelated,
    distinct meanings (such as "bank").

    - Homographs: bank/bank, bat/bat
    - Homophones: write/right, piece/peace

polysemy
    A polysemous word has related meanings,
    for example:

    - "the bank was built in 1875 ("bank" = a
      building belonging to a financial
      institution)"
    - "I withdrew money from the bank ("bank"
      = a financial institution)"

    - Systematic polysemy, or metonymy, is
      when the meanings have a systematic
      relationship.
    - For example, "school", "university",
      "hospital" - all can mean the
      institution or the building, so the
      systematic relationship here is building
      <=> organization.
    - Another example is author <=> works of
      author, e.g. "Jane Austen wrote Emma"
      and "I love Jane Austen".

synonyms
    Different words that have the same
    propositional meaning in some or all
    contexts.

    However, there may be no examples of
    perfect synonymy since even if
    propositional meaning is identical, they
    may vary in notions of politeness or other
    usages and so on.

    Examples:
    - "water" and "H2O" - each are more
      appropriate in different contexts.
    - "big" and "large" - sometimes they can
      be swapped, sometimes they cannot:
      - That's a big plane. How large is that
        plane? (Acceptable)
      - Miss Nelson became kind of a big
        sister to Benjamin. Miss Nelson became
        kind of a large sister to Benjamin
        (Not as acceptable)

      The latter works less because "big" has
      multiple senses, one of which does not
      correspond to "large".

antonyms
    Senses which are opposite with respect to
    one feature of meaning, but otherwise are
    similar, such as dark/light, short/fast,
    etc.

hyponym
    One sense is a hyponym of another if the
    first sense is more specific (i.e. denotes
    a subclass of the other).

    Examples:
    - car is a hyponym of vehicle
    - mango is a hyponym of fruit

Infinitive
    A linguistics term for certain verb forms
    existing in many languages, most often
    used as non-finite verbs.
    
    As with many linguistic concepts, there is
    not a single definition applicable to all
    languages.

    A verbal consisting of the word to plus a
    verb (in its simplest "stem" form) and
    functioning as a noun, adjective, or
    adverb.
    
    The term verbal indicates that an
    infinitive, like the other two kinds of
    verbals, is based on a verb and therefore
    expresses action or a state of being.

apostrophe
    An exclamatory passage in a speech or poem
    addressed to a person (typically one who
    is dead or absent) or thing (typically one
    that is personified).

    It's a little bit like a soliloquy.

polysemy
    Lexical ambiguity.

    The ambiguity of an individual word or
    phrase that can be used (in different
    contexts) to express two or more different
    meanings.

    Characterized as the phenomenon whereby a
    single word form is associated with two or
    several related senses.
    
    It is distinguished from monosemy.

monosemy
    Where one word form is associated with a
    single meaning, and homonymy, where a
    single word form is associated with two or
    several unrelated meanings.       

homosemy
    The state of having identical or exactly
    the same meaning.

troponym
    A verb that indicates more precisely the
    manner of doing something by replacing a
    verb of a more generalized meaning.
    'Stroll' is a troponym of 'walk', since it
    involves a slow and relaxed sort of
    walking.

troponymy
    The presence of a 'manner' relation
    between two lexemes. The concept was
    originally proposed by Christiane Fellbaum
    and George Miller. Some examples they gave
    are "to nibble is to eat in a certain
    manner, and to gorge is to eat in a
    different manner.

meronyms
    A term which denotes part of something but
    which is used to refer to the whole of it,
    e.g. faces when used to mean people in I
    see several familiar faces present.

Coordinate Terms (sisters)
    A term which shares a hypernym with
    another.

hypernym
superordinate
superordinate word
    A word that is more generic than a given
    word.

    Examples:
    - vehicle is a hypernym of car
    - fruit is a hypernym of mango

collocation
    [corpus linguistics]

    The habitual juxtaposition of a particular
    word with another word or words with a
    frequency greater than chance.

    Examples:
    - strong tea
    - heavy drinker

bigram
    A pair of consecutive written units such
    as letters, syllables, or words.

interlocutor
    [#linguistics]
    [#discourse analysis]

    A person involved in a conversation or
    dialogue.
    
    Two or more people speaking to one another
    are each other's interlocutors.
    
    The terms conversation partner, hearer, or
    addressee are oftentimes used
    interchangeably with interlocutor.

metapragmatics
    The study of how the effects and
    conditions of language use themselves
    become objects of discourse.
    
    The term is commonly associated with the
    semiotically-informed linguistic
    anthropology of Michael Silverstein.

agglutinative language
    The noun is followed by a particle, and
    the stem of the verb or adjective is
    followed by endings, expressing various
    grammatical properties.

portmanteau
portmanteau word
    A blend of words in which parts of
    multiple words are combined into a new
    word, as in smog, coined by blending smoke
    and fog, or motel, from motor and hotel.
    
    In linguistics, a portmanteau is a single
    morph that is analyzed as representing two
    underlying morphemes.

penult
    A linguistics term for the second to last
    syllable of a word.
    
    It is an abbreviation of penultimate,
    which describes the next-to-last item in a
    series.
    
    The penult follows the antepenult and
    precedes the ultima.

diachrony
synchrony
    Synchrony and diachrony are two different
    and complementary viewpoints in linguistic
    analysis.
    
    A synchronic approach considers a language
    at a moment in time without taking its
    history into account.
    
    Synchronic linguistics aims at describing
    a language at a specific point of time,
    usually the present.

circumlocution
    A phrase that circles around a specific
    idea with multiple words rather than
    directly evoking it with fewer and apter
    words.
    
    It is sometimes necessary in
    communication, but it can also be
    undesirable.

epithet
    A byname, or a descriptive term,
    accompanying or occurring in place of a
    name and having entered common usage.
    
    It has various shades of meaning when
    applied to seemingly real or fictitious
    people, divinities, objects, and binomial
    nomenclature.

pleonasm
    The use of more words than are necessary
    to convey meaning (e.g. see with one's
    eyes ), either as a fault of style or for
    emphasis.

    Redundancy in linguistic expression, such
    as "black darkness" or "burning fire".
    
    It is a manifestation of tautology by
    traditional rhetorical criteria, and might
    be considered a fault of style.
    
    Pleonasm may also be used for emphasis, or
    because the phrase has become established
    in a certain form.

types of force
    [#Speech Act Theory]

    - locutionary act
    - illocutionary act
    - perlocutionary act

locution
    What was said.

    i.e. someone tries to say X in French.

    The words of X is what the locutionary act
    was -- the utterance itself.

    It would still be locution if there were
    no hearer.

illocution
    The aim of a speaker in making an
    utterance as opposed to the meaning of the
    terms used.

    i.e. The recipient was Italian so the
    words meant Y to them, not X.

    Illocution was still X, although it may
    have come across as Y.

    There must be a hearer or the hope of a
    hearer for there to be illocutionary
    force, as the aim is to evoke something
    from someone somewhere.

perlocution
    What happened as a result.

    i.e. Y sounded like a command of sorts
    when interpreted in Italian, and so the
    recipient responded as if the speaker said
    Y instead of X.

    Even just the interpretation could be
    considered the Y.

locutionary act
    [#linguistics]
    [#philosophy of language]
    [#speech-act theory]

    [type of force]

    The performance of an utterance, and is
    one of the types of force, in addition to
    illocutionary act and perlocutionary act,
    typically cited in Speech Act Theory.

illocutionary act
    [#linguistics]
    [#philosophy of language]
    [#speech-act theory]

    [type of force]

    In speech-act theory, the term
    illocutionary act refers to the use of a
    sentence to express an attitude with a
    certain function or "force," called an
    illocutionary force, which differs from
    locutionary acts in that they carry a
    certain urgency and appeal to the meaning
    and direction of the speaker.

    The concept of illocutionary acts was
    introduced into linguistics by the
    philosopher J. L. Austin in his
    investigation of the various aspects of
    speech acts.
    
    In his framework, locution is what was
    said and meant, illocution is what was
    done, and perlocution is what happened as
    a result.

perlocutionary act
    [#linguistics]
    [#philosophy of language]
    [#speech-act theory]

    [type of force]

    The effect of an utterance on an
    interlocutor.
    
    Examples of perlocutionary acts include
    persuading, convincing, scaring,
    enlightening, inspiring, or otherwise
    affecting the interlocutor.

transitive verb
    A verb that accepts one or more objects.
    
    This contrasts with intransitive verbs,
    which do not have objects.
    
    Transitivity is traditionally thought a
    global property of a clause, by which
    activity is transferred from an agent to a
    patient.

neologism
    A newly coined word or expression.

    A neologism is a relatively recent or
    isolated term, word, or phrase that may be
    in the process of entering common use, but
    that has not yet been fully accepted into
    mainstream language.
    
    Neologisms are often driven by changes in
    culture and technology.

thematic
    Having or relating to subjects or a
    particular subject.
    "the book is organized into nine thematic
    chapters"

    Relating to or denoting the theme of a
    sentence.
    "some languages use special affixes to
    mark thematic and non-thematic elements"

Sapir-Whorf hypothesis
    Holds that our thoughts are shaped by our
    native language, and that speakers of
    different languages therefore think
    differently.

    The way you use a language shapes your
    world but in 70 years there is almost zero
    evidence that a language shapes your
    interpretation of the world.

generativity
    The use of finite resources to produce an
    infinite variety of sentences

    Language has the property of generativity.

language universal
    A feature common to all languages.

absolute linguistic universal
    A feature common to all languages.

    Rare, unless one takes an over-broad view
    of the word 'universal'.
    
    Even when apparently found, they differ in
    details from language to language.

psycholinguistics
    The field of study in which researchers
    investigate the psychological processes
    involved in the use of language, including
    language comprehension, language
    production, and first and second language
    acquisition.

polysemy
polysemic
    The capacity for a word or phrase to have
    multiple related meanings.
    
    Polysemy is thus distinct from homonymy—or
    homophony—which is an accidental
    similarity between two or more words;
    while homonymy is a mere linguistic
    coincidence, polysemy is not.

biolinguistics
    The study of biology and the evolution of
    language.
    
    It is highly interdisciplinary as it is
    related to various fields such as biology,
    linguistics, psychology, anthropology,
    mathematics, and neurolinguistics to
    explain the formation of language.

phatic expression
phatic communication
    [#linguistics]

    A phatic expression is communication which
    serves a social function, such as social
    pleasantries that don't seek or offer
    information of intrinsic value but can
    signal willingness to observe conventional
    local expectations for politeness.

hapax legomenon
hapax
hapaxes
    A word or an expression that occurs only
    once within a context: either in the
    written record of an entire language, in
    the works of an author, or in a single
    text.

    Literally, it means "being said once".

dis legomenon
    [hapax legomenon]

    Triple occurrences.

tris legomenon
    [hapax legomenon]

    Triple occurrences.

tetrakis legomenon
    [hapax legomenon]

    Quadruple occurrences.

synchronic
    Concerned with something, especially a
    language, as it exists at one point in
    time.
    "synchronic linguistics"

modality
    [#natural language]
    [#linguistics]
    [#philosophy]

    The phenomenon whereby language is used to
    discuss possible situations.
    
    For instance, a modal expression may
    convey that something is likely,
    desirable, or permissible.

coreference
co-reference
    Sometimes written co-reference, occurs
    when two or more expressions in a text
    refer to the same person or thing; they
    have the same referent, e.g. Bill said he
    would come; the proper noun Bill and the
    pronoun he refer to the same person,
    namely to Bill.

Affix
    [#linguistics]
    [morpheme]

    A morpheme that is attached to a word stem
    to form a new word or word form.

    Affixes may be derivational, like English
    -ness and pre-, or inflectional, like
    English plural -s and past tense -ed.

    They are bound morphemes by definition;
    prefixes and suffixes may be separable
    affixes.

semiosis
    It is important to understand what I mean
    by semiosis.
    
    All dynamical action, or action of brute
    force, physical or psychical, either takes
    place between two subjects (whether they
    react equally upon each other, or one is
    agent and the other patient, entirely or
    partially) or at any rate is a resultant
    of such actions between pairs.
    
    But by “semiosis” I mean, on the contrary,
    an action, or influence, which is, or
    involves, a coöperation of three subjects,
    such as a sign, its object, and its
    interpretant, this tri-relative influence
    not being in any way resolvable into
    actions between pairs.

constructive vs selective grammar
    We will distinguish between selective
    grammars and constructive grammars
    following the spirit of the classical
    terminological distinction that Massimo
    Piattelli-Palmarini (1989) originally
    introduced into linguistics from biology.

    In textbooks, you will never find the
    rules that eliminate the impossible
    combinations of words (selective
    grammars).

    You only find the rules that describe the
    possible combinations (constructive
    grammars), and among these rules, you are
    likely to find just those that lead to
    ‘‘proper’’ language rather than actual
    spoken language.

X-bar theory
X` theory
    A theory of syntactic category formation.

    It embodies two independent claims: one,
    that phrases may contain intermediate
    constituents projected from a head X; and
    two, that this system of projected
    constituency may be common to more than
    one category.

    Noam Chomsky said something about it.

phonology
    A branch of linguistics that studies how
    languages or dialects systematically
    organize their sounds.

    The term also refers to the sound system
    of any particular language variety.

    At one time, the study of phonology only
    related to the study of the systems of
    phonemes in spoken languages.

Reflexive pronoun
    In general linguistics, a reflexive
    pronoun, sometimes simply called a
    reflexive, is an anaphoric pronoun that
    must be coreferential with another nominal
    within the same clause.

    In the English language specifically, a
    reflexive pronoun will end in ‑self or
    ‑selves, and refer to a previously named
    noun or pronoun.

phrasal verb
    An idiomatic phrase consisting of a verb
    and another element, typically either an
    adverb, as in break down, or a
    preposition, for example see to, or a
    combination of both, such as look down on.

tripartite alignment
    A type of morphosyntactic alignment in
    which the main argument ('subject') of an
    intransitive verb, the agent argument
    ('subject') of a transitive verb, and the
    patient argument ('direct object') of a
    transitive verb are each treated
    distinctly in the grammatical system of a
    language.
    
    This is in contrast with nominative-
    accusative and ergative-absolutive
    alignment languages, in which the argument
    of an intransitive verb patterns with
    either the agent argument of the
    transitive (in accusative languages) or
    with the patient argument of the
    transitive (in ergative languages).
    
    Thus, whereas in English, "she" in "she
    runs" patterns with "she" in "she finds
    it", and an ergative language would
    pattern "she" in "she runs" with "her" in
    "he likes her", a tripartite language
    would treat the "she" in "she runs" as
    morphologically and/or syntactically
    distinct from either argument in "he likes
    her".

morphological typology
    A way of classifying the languages of the
    world (see linguistic typology) that
    groups languages according to their common
    morphological structures.
    
    The field organizes languages on the basis
    of how those languages form words by
    combining morphemes.
    
    Analytic languages contain very little
    inflection, instead relying on features
    like word order and auxiliary words to
    convey meaning.
    
    Synthetic languages, ones that are not
    analytic, are divided into two categories:
    agglutinative and fusional languages

linguistic typology
language typology
    [field of linguistics]
    
    Studies and classifies languages according
    to their structural and functional
    features.
    
    Its aim is to describe and explain the
    common properties and the structural
    diversity of the world's languages.

    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistic_typology

agglutination
    Words may contain different morphemes to
    determine their meanings, but all of these
    morphemes (including stems and affixes)
    remain, in every aspect, unchanged after
    their unions.

agglutinative language
    [synthetic language]
    
    Its morphology primarily uses
    agglutination.

    This results in generally more easily
    deducible word meanings if compared to
    fusional languages, which allow
    modifications in either or both the
    phonetics or spelling of one or more
    morphemes within a word, usually
    shortening the word or providing easier
    pronunciation.
    
    Agglutinative languages have generally one
    grammatical category per affix while
    fusional languages have multiple.
    
    The term was introduced by Wilhelm von
    Humboldt to classify languages from a
    morphological point of view.
    
    It is derived from the Latin verb
    agglutinare, which means "to glue
    together".

fusional languages
    Non-agglutinative synthetic languages are
    fusional languages; morphologically, they
    combine affixes by "squeezing" them
    together, drastically changing them in the
    process, and joining several meanings in a
    single affix (for example, in the Spanish
    word comí "I ate", the suffix -í carries
    the meanings of first person, singular
    number, past tense, perfective aspect,
    indicative mood, active voice.)
    
    The term agglutinative is sometimes
    incorrectly used as a synonym for
    synthetic.
    
    Used in this way, the term embraces both
    fusional languages and inflected
    languages.[clarification needed]
    
    The agglutinative and fusional languages
    are two ends of a continuum, with various
    languages falling more toward one or the
    other end.
    
    For example, Japanese is generally
    agglutinative, but displays fusion in
    otōto (弟 younger brother), from oto+hito
    (originally woto+pito), and in its non-
    affixing verb conjugations.
    
    A synthetic language may use morphological
    agglutination combined with partial usage
    of fusional features, for example in its
    case system (e.g., German, Dutch, and
    Persian).
    
    Agglutinative languages tend to have a
    high rate of affixes or morphemes per
    word, and to be very regular, in
    particular with very few irregular verbs.
    
    For example, Japanese has very few
    irregular verbs –
    
    only two are significantly irregular, and
    there are only about a dozen others with
    only minor irregularity; Ganda has only
    one (or two, depending on how "irregular"
    is defined); while in the Quechua
    languages, all the ordinary verbs are
    regular.
    
    In Turkish, there is only one irregular
    noun (su, meaning water), no irregular
    verbs other than the copular verbs, and
    two existential particles.
    
    Korean has only ten irregular forms of
    conjugation except for the passive and
    causative conjugations.
    
    Georgian is an exception; it is highly
    agglutinative (with up to eight morphemes
    per word), but it has a significant number
    of irregular verbs with varying degrees of
    irregularity.

anaphora
anaphoric
    An expression, or the use of an
    expression, whose interpretation depends
    upon another expression in context.

    Example,
        Anaphoric if

subject-verb-object
SVO

Cohesion
    The grammatical and lexical linking within
    a text or sentence that holds a text
    together and gives it meaning.
    
    It is related to the broader concept of
    coherence.

lexicon
word-hoard
wordbook
word-stock
    The vocabulary of a person, language, or
    branch of knowledge.
    
    In linguistics, a lexicon is a language's
    inventory of lexemes.

rewrite rule
rewriting rule
    [#linguistics]
    [phrase-structure rule]
    
    Phrase-structure rule in a generative
    grammar, shown as an instruction to
    replace or rewrite a single symbol,
    representing a syntactic structure, on the
    left with one or more symbols,
    representing the constituents of the
    structure, on the right, as in S → NP +
    VP, where S (sentence) is to be replaced
    with its constituents NP (noun phrase) and
    VP (verb phrase).

Distributional hypothesis
    [#linguistics]

    Linguistic items with similar
    distributions have similar meanings.

distributed semantics
    [#linguistics]
    [research area]
    
    Develops and studies theories and methods
    for quantifying and categorizing semantic
    similarities between linguistic items
    based on their distributional properties
    in large samples of language data.
    
    The basic idea of distributional semantics
    can be summed up in the so-called
    Distributional hypothesis.

morphology
    The study of words, how they are formed,
    and their relationship to other words in
    the same language.
    
    It analyzes the structure of words and
    parts of words, such as stems, root words,
    prefixes, and suffixes.
    
    Morphology also looks at parts of speech,
    intonation and stress, and the ways
    context can change a word's pronunciation
    and meaning.
    
    Morphology differs from morphological
    typology, which is the classification of
    languages based on their use of words, and
    lexicology, which is the study of words
    and how they make up a language's
    vocabulary.

inflectional morphology

realization
    [#linguistics]
    
    The process by which some kind of surface
    representation is derived from its
    underlying representation; that is, the
    way in which some abstract object of
    linguistic analysis comes to be produced
    in actual language.
    
    Phonemes are often said to be realized by
    speech sounds.

linguistic categories
    Examples:
    - noun
    - verb
    - adjective

    https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4020-8825-4_1

fuzzy linguistic categories
    [#corpus linguistics]

universal category
    Many linguists see NOUN and VERB as
    universal categories.

    But how universal are they really?
    https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4020-8825-4_1

inter-annotator aggreement
    A measure of how well two (or more)
    annotators can make the same annotation
    decision for a certain category.

    https://corpuslinguisticmethods.wordpress.com/2014/01/15/what-is-inter-annotator-agreement/

    Even basic categories such as parts of
    speech are not entirely clearly defined.
    
    As a corpus linguist, you make some
    decision for the annotation, but you
    actually want to provide the user of your
    dataset with some kind of a metric about
    how certain you are about the annotation
    of that category.
    
    Well, that is where inter-annotator
    agreement comes into play.

literary consonance
    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literary_consonance
    
    A stylistic literary device identified by
    the repetition of identical or similar
    consonants in neighbouring words whose
    vowel sounds are different (e.g. coming
    home, hot foot).
    
    Consonance may be regarded as the
    counterpart to the vowel-sound repetition
    known as assonance.
    
    Alliteration is a special case of
    consonance where the repeated consonant
    sound is at the stressed syllable, as in
    "few flocked to the fight" or "around the
    rugged rock the ragged rascal ran".
    
    Alliteration is usually distinguished from
    other types of consonance in poetic
    analysis, and has different uses and
    effects.
    
    Another special case of consonance is
    sibilance, the use of several sibilant
    sounds such as /s/ and /sh/.
    
    An example is the verse from Edgar Allan
    Poe's "The Raven": "And the silken sad
    uncertain rustling of each purple
    curtain."
    
    (This example also contains assonance
    around the "ur" sound.)
    
    Another example of consonance is the word
    "sibilance" itself.

semantics
    The branch of linguistics and logic
    concerned with meaning.
    
    There are a number of branches and
    subbranches of semantics, including formal
    semantics, which studies the logical
    aspects of meaning, such as sense,
    reference, implication, and logical form,
    lexical semantics, which studies word
    meanings and word relations, and
    conceptual semantics, which studies the
    cognitive structure of meaning.

pragmatics
    The study of how context contributes to
    meaning.
    
    The field of study evaluates how human
    language is utilized in social
    interactions, as well as the relationship
    between the interpreter and the
    interpreted.

semantics vs pragmatics
    Semantics is the study of meaning, or more
    precisely, the study of the relation
    between linguistic expressions and their
    meanings.

    Pragmatics is the study of context, or
    more precisely, a study of the way context
    can influence our understanding of
    linguistic utterances.

rhetorical device
    [linguistic tool]

    Employs a particular type of sentence
    structure, sound, or pattern of meaning in
    order to evoke a particular reaction from
    an audience.
    
    Each rhetorical device is a distinct tool
    that can be used to construct an argument
    or make an existing argument more
    compelling.

morphosyntactic
    Involving both morphology and syntax.

morphosyntactic alignment
    Morphosyntactic alignment is the
    grammatical relationship between
    arguments—specifically, between the two
    arguments of transitive verbs like the dog
    chased the cat, and the single argument of
    intransitive verbs like the cat ran away.

polysemy
    The ability of words to have multiple
    meanings.

function words
functioning words
functors
    Words that have little lexical meaning or
    have ambiguous meaning and express
    grammatical relationships among other
    words within a sentence, or specify the
    attitude or mood of the speaker.
    
    They signal the structural relationships
    that words have to one another and are the
    glue that holds sentences together.
    
    Thus they form important elements in the
    structures of sentences.

bearing
content bearing
    Said to be provided by a document's
    content words.

content words
open class words
lexical words
autosemantic words
    Words that are considered to carry a
    meaning related to the text are described
    as the "content bearing".

    Words that are not function words.

    Include:
    - nouns,
    - verbs,
    - adjectives, and
    - most adverbs, although some adverbs are
      function words (e.g., then and why).

    Dictionaries define the specific meanings
    of content words, but can only describe
    the general usages of function words.
    
    By contrast, grammars describe the use of
    function words in detail, but treat
    lexical words in general terms only.

imperative mood
    A form of a verb that expresses an order
    or a request or an advice or encouragement
    or instruction or suggestion to do a
    thing.
    
    Examples of The Imperative Mood:
    - Work sincerely.
    - Try to keep quiet.
    - Please have your food on time.

indicative form
indicative mood
    A verb form that makes a statement or asks
    a question. For example: 

    - Jack sings every Friday.
      (This is a verb in the indicative mood.
      It's a statement.) 
    - Is Jack the lead vocalist?
      (This is a verb in the indicative mood.
      It's a question.) 
    
    Compare the examples above with this: 
    
    - Sing us a song, Jack.
      (This verb is not in the indicative
      mood. It is in the imperative mood. It's
      an order. It's not a statement or a
      question.)

agglutinative language
    A type of synthetic language with
    morphology that primarily uses
    agglutination.
    
    Words may contain different morphemes to
    determine their meanings, but all of these
    morphemes remain, in every aspect,
    unchanged after their unions.

agglutination
    The clumping of particles.
    
    The word agglutination comes from the
    Latin agglutinare (glueing to).
    
    Agglutination is the process that occurs
    if an antigen is mixed with its
    corresponding antibody called
    isoagglutinin.
    
    This term is commonly used in blood
    grouping.

agglutinative
agglutinative morphology
    (of a language) forming words
    predominantly by agglutination, rather
    than by inflection or by using isolated
    elements.
    
    Examples include Hungarian, Turkish,
    Korean, and Swahili.

Auxiliary verb
    A verb that adds functional or grammatical
    meaning to the clause in which it occurs,
    so as to express tense, aspect, modality,
    voice, emphasis, etc.
    
    Auxiliary verbs usually accompany an
    infinitive verb or a participle, which
    respectively provide the main semantic
    content of the clause.

diphthong (diff-thong)
gliding vowel
    Literally, double sound.

    Combination of two adjacent vowel sounds
    within the same syllable.

    It's a vowel sound.

connotation
    A commonly understood cultural or
    emotional association that some word or
    phrase carries, in addition to its
    explicit or literal meaning, which is its
    denotation.
    
    A connotation is frequently described as
    either positive or negative, with regard
    to its pleasing or displeasing emotional
    connection.

    Related to "sentiment".

An ergative language maintains a syntactic
    or morphological equivalence (such as the
    same word order or grammatical case) for
    the object of a transitive verb and the
    single core argument of an intransitive
    verb, while treating the agent of a
    transitive verb differently.

    vs "accusative languages".

accusative languages
nominative-accusative languages
    [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ergative%E2%80%93absolutive_alignment][en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ergative%E2%80%93absolutive_alignment]]

    This contrasts with nominative-accusative
    languages such as English, where the
    single argument of an intransitive verb
    and the agent of a transitive verb (both
    called the subject) are treated alike and
    kept distinct from the object of a
    transitive verb.

nominal
    [linguistics]

    Refers to a category used to group
    together nouns and adjectives based on
    shared properties.
    
    The motivation for nominal grouping is
    that in many languages nouns and
    adjectives share a number of morphological
    and syntactic properties

inflected
inflection
    [linguistic morphology]

    A process of word formation, in which a
    word is modified to express different
    grammatical categories such as tense,
    case, voice, aspect, person, number,
    gender, mood, animacy, and definiteness. 

inflectional morphology
    The study of processes, including
    affixation and vowel change, that
    distinguish word forms in certain
    grammatical categories.

    NLG: The study of how words change their
    form to express different meanings.

Two-dimensionalism
    An approach to semantics in analytic
    philosophy.
    
    It is a theory of how to determine the
    sense and reference of a word and the
    truth-value of a sentence.
    
    It is intended to resolve the puzzle: How
    is it possible to discover empirically
    that a necessary truth is true? Two-
    dimensionalism provides an analysis of the
    semantics of words and sentences that
    makes sense of this possibility.
    
    The theory was first developed by Robert
    Stalnaker, but it has been advocated by
    numerous philosophers since, including
    David Chalmers.

finite verb
    The form "to which number and person
    appertain", in other words, those
    inflected for number and person.

    Verbs were originally said to be finite if
    their form limited the possible person and
    number of the subject.

nonfinite verb
    A derivative form of a verb unlike finite
    verbs.
    
    Accordingly, nonfinite verb forms are
    inflected for neither number nor person,
    and they cannot perform action as the root
    of an independent clause.
    
    In English, nonfinite verbs include
    infinitives, participles and gerunds.

participle
    [#linguistics]

    A nonfinite verb form that has some of the
    characteristics and functions of both
    verbs and adjectives.
    
    More narrowly, participle has been defined
    as "a word derived from a verb and used as
    an adjective, as in a laughing face".

past participle
    For regular verbs, adding -ed to the base
    form creates the past participle.

    For example, the past participle of cook
    is cooked.

    Past participles formed from irregular
    verbs may have endings like -en, -t, -d,
    and -n.

    Examples:
    - swollen,
    - burnt,
    - fazed
    - hoped, and
    - broken.

    Three forms:
    - regular,
    - irregular, and
    - adjective.

    The regular form of the past participle
    ends in -ed, demonstrating a past action.
    
    The irregular form of the past participle
    includes the word has' and puts the verb
    into its past tense form, also
    demonstrating a past action.

cloze
    Pertaining to or being a procedure used to
    measure comprehension or text difficulty,
    in which a person is called upon to supply
    elements that have been systematically
    deleted from a text.

phonetics
    The study of speech sounds in their
    physical aspects.

phonology
    The study of speech sounds in their
    cognitive aspects.

morphology
    The study of the formation of words.

syntax
    The study of the formation of sentences.

semantics
    The study of meaning.

pragmatics
    The study of language use.

monosyllable
    A word or utterance of only one syllable.
    
    It is most commonly studied in the fields
    of phonology and morphology and it has no
    semantic content.
    
    The word has originated from the Greek
    language.
    
    "Yes", "no", "jump", "buy", "heat",
    "sure", and "and" are examples of
    monosyllables.
