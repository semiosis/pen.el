query parser
    Parsing of a query is the process by which
    this decision making is done that for a
    given query, calculating how many
    different ways there are in which the
    query can run.
    
    Every query must be parsed at least once.
    
    The parsing of a query is performed within
    the database using the Optimizer
    component.
