Computer architecture
    Concerned with balancing the performance,
    efficiency, cost, and reliability of a
    computer system.
    
    The case of instruction set architecture
    can be used illustrate the balance of
    these competing factors.

massively parallel processor array
multi purpose processor array
MPPA
    A type of integrated circuit which has a
    massively parallel array of hundreds or
    thousands of CPUs and RAM memories.
    
    These processors pass work to one another
    through a reconfigurable interconnect of
    channels.
    
    By harnessing a large number of processors
    working in parallel, an MPPA chip can
    accomplish more demanding tasks than
    conventional chips.
    
    MPPAs are based on a software parallel
    programming model for developing high-
    performance embedded system applications.
