proveniencially
    [neologism]

    Of or relating to a provenience.

    "God revealed Himself to me in a higher
    dimension which manifested physically and
    temporally (synchronistically and
    proveniencially; without a-priori
    knowledge, but confirmed though studying
    historical records and phenomenology). Now
    I am truly seeking God wholeheartedly."
