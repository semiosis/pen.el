hedonic happiness
    Think of a wonderful party with delicious
    food, sparkling conversation and all your
    favorite people in attendance.
    
    There’s great momentary pleasure
    and—fingers crossed—scant pain involved.

eudaimonic happiness
    Comes from leading a life filled with
    meaning and purpose.
    
    Forget the amusement park, the martini or
    the shopping spree.
    
    Instead, think about things like
    volunteering, writing a novel, training
    for a marathon or launching your own
    business.
    
    We’re talking about activities that we
    think are important, we’re passionate
    about, we find challenging and we feel
    we’re good at.
    
    These sorts of meaningful, fulfilling
    activities might allow us to enjoy a
    Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi moment of “flow”
    and get us to the top of Abraham Maslow’s
    hierarchy of needs, where we achieve
    “self-actualization.”

hedonic treadmill
    It seems any boost in hedonic happiness
    tends to be fleeting, and we soon return
    to our personal set point—our base level
    of happiness.
    
    This is the idea behind the so-called
    hedonic treadmill, where we constantly
    strive for greater happiness, only to find
    ourselves running in place.
    
    Meanwhile, increases in eudaimonic
    happiness have the potential to be longer
    lasting, but such increases also take far
    more effort.
