Horn clause
    [#mathematical logic]
    [#logic programming]

    A logical formula of a particular rule-
    like form which gives it useful properties
    for use in logic programming, formal
    specification, and model theory.
    
    Horn clauses are named for the logician
    Alfred Horn, who first pointed out their
    significance in 1951.

logic
    Types
    - epistemic,
    - doxastic,
    - temporal,
    - deontic,
    - modal,
    - paraconsistent,
    - default,
    - defeasible,
    - nonmonotonic

epistemic
epistemic modal logic
    [type of logic]

    A subfield of modal logic that is
    concerned with reasoning about knowledge.

doxastic
    [type of logic]

    A type of logic concerned with reasoning
    about beliefs.
    
    The term doxastic derives from the Ancient
    Greek δόξα, from which the English term
    doxa is also borrowed.

temporal
    [type of logic]

    Any system of rules and symbolism for
    representing, and reasoning about,
    propositions qualified in terms of time.

    For example:
    - "I am always hungry"
    - "I will eventually be hungry"
    - "I will be hungry until I eat something"

deontic
    [type of logic]

    The field of philosophical logic that is
    concerned with obligation, permission, and
    related concepts.
    
    Alternatively, a deontic logic is a formal
    system that attempts to capture the
    essential logical features of these
    concepts.

modal
    [type of logic]

    A collection of formal systems originally
    developed and still widely used to
    represent statements about necessity and
    possibility.
    
    The basic unary modal operators are most
    often interpreted "□" for "Necessarily"
    and "◇" for "Possibly".

paraconsistent
    [type of logic]

    An attempt at a logical system to deal
    with contradictions in a discriminating
    way.
    
    Alternatively, paraconsistent logic is the
    subfield of logic that is concerned with
    studying and developing "inconsistency-
    tolerant" systems of logic which reject
    the principle of explosion.

default
    [type of logic]

    A non-monotonic logic proposed by Raymond
    Reiter to formalize reasoning with default
    assumptions.
    
    Default logic can express facts like “by
    default, something is true”; by contrast,
    standard logic can only express that
    something is true or that something is
    false.

defeasible
    [type of logic]
    
    A non-monotonic logic proposed by Donald
    Nute to formalize defeasible reasoning.
    
    In defeasible logic, there are three
    different types of propositions:
    
    - Strict rules.
      Specify that a fact is always a
      consequence of another

    - Defeasible rules.
      Specify that a fact is typically a
      consequence of another

    - Undercutting defeaters.
      specify exceptions to defeasible rules.

    A priority ordering over the defeasible
    rules and the defeaters can be given.
    
    During the process of deduction, the
    strict rules are always applied, while a
    defeasible rule can be applied only if no
    defeater of a higher priority specifies
    that it should not.

nonmonotonic
non-monotonic
    [type of logic]

    A formal logic whose conclusion relation
    is not monotonic.
    
    In other words, non-monotonic logics are
    devised to capture and represent
    defeasible inferences (cf. defeasible
    reasoning), i.e., a kind of inference in
    which reasoners draw tentative
    conclusions, enabling reasoners to retract
    their conclusion(s) based on further
    evidence.

Lemma
    [#Mathematics]
    [#informal logic]
    [#argument mapping]

    A lemma is a generally minor, proven
    proposition which is used as a stepping
    stone to a larger result.

    For that reason, it is also known as a
    "helping theorem" or an "auxiliary
    theorem".

interpretability
    A relation between formal theories that
    expresses the possibility of interpreting
    or translating one into the other.

syllogism
    A syllogism is a kind of logical argument
    that applies deductive reasoning to arrive
    at a conclusion based on two or more
    propositions that are asserted or assumed
    to be true.

    In a form, defined by Aristotle, from the
    combination of a general statement and a
    specific statement, a conclusion is
    deduced.

Homotopy type theory
HoTT
    Various lines of development of
    intuitionistic type theory, based on the
    interpretation of types as objects to
    which the intuition of (abstract) homotopy
    theory applies.

SMT instance
    A generalization of a Boolean SAT instance
    in which various sets of variables are
    replaced by predicates from a variety of
    underlying theories.
    
    SMT formulas provide a much richer
    modeling language than is possible with
    Boolean SAT formulas.

SMT problem
    An extended version of SAT problem.
    
    Given a formula, checking if there is a
    set of values for variables that satisfies
    the formula.
    
    The difference is, that SAT only deals
    with boolean expressions, whereas SMT can
    handle various types such as integer, bit
    vector and real number.
    
    Depending on which theory to use, you can
    express constraints in different formats.
    
    This time, we will use linear integer
    arithmetic, where equations in the SMT
    problems are linear equations over integer
    variables.
    
    There are many SMT Solvers, but I chose Z3
    because it is well documented and is
    ported to Python language.
    
    It’s really easy to use.

Conjunctive Normal Form
CNF
cnf
    Like many SAT solvers, MiniSAT requires
    that its input be in CNF.

    Built from these building blocks:
    - term
      A term is either a boolean variable
      (e.g., x4) or a negated boolean variable
      (NOT x4, written here as -x4).

    - clause
      A clause is a set of one or more terms,
      connected with OR (written here as |);
      boolean variables may not repeat inside
      a clause.

    - expression
      An expression is a set of one or more
      clauses, each connected by AND (written
      here as &).

modus ponens
method of affirming
    [#logic]
    [rule of logic]

    The rule of logic which states that if a
    conditional statement (‘if p then q ’) is
    accepted, and the antecedent ( p ) holds,
    then the consequent ( q ) may be inferred.

    If a conditional statement (‘if p then q
    ’) is accepted, and the antecedent ( p )
    holds, then the consequent ( q ) may be
    inferred.

subject
    https://www.jstor.org/stable/1398382?origin=crossref

predicate
    Takes an argument as input and outputs
    true or false.

    Example, -type in the find command.
        "-type f" is not a predicate.

        The predicate is 'is the type', not
        'the type is f'.

        Predicates can take several variables.

        "Socrates is the teacher of Plato",
        the predicate "is the teacher of"
        takes two variables.

        Therefore the predicate "-type"
        actually takes 2 variables, the
        current node being checked and the
        type of the node.

    The part of a sentence or clause
    containing a verb and stating something
    about the subject (e.g. went home in John
    went home ).

    Something which is affirmed or denied
    concerning an argument of a proposition.

argumentum a fortiori
    A form of argumentation that draws upon
    existing confidence in a proposition to
    argue in favor of a second proposition
    that is held to be implicit in, and even
    more certain than, the first.

First-order logic
    Symbolized reasoning in which each
    sentence, or statement, is broken down
    into a subject and a predicate.
    
    The predicate modifies or defines the
    properties of the subject.
    
    In first-order logic, a predicate can only
    refer to a single subject.

    E.g. Prolog.

Second-order logic
    [#logic and mathematics]

    An extension of first-order logic, which
    itself is an extension of propositional
    logic.
    
    Second-order logic is in turn extended by
    higher-order logic and type theory.
    
    First-order logic quantifies only
    variables that range over individuals
    (elements of the domain of discourse);
    second-order logic, in addition, also
    quantifies over relations.
    
    For example, the second-order sentence
    ∀P∀x(Px ∨ ¬Px) says that for every formula
    P, and every individual x, either Px is
    true or not(Px) is true (this is the law
    of excluded middle).
    
    Second-order logic also includes
    quantification over sets, functions, and
    other variables (see section below).
    
    Both first-order and second-order logic
    use the idea of a domain of discourse
    (often called simply the "domain" or the
    "universe").
    
    The domain is a set over which individual
    elements may be quantified.

conjunction
    [#logic]

    AND.

action
    Actions are described by a set of action
    schemas that implicitly define the
    ACTIONS(s) and RESULT(s, a) functions
    needed to do a problem-solving search.
    
    Classical planning concentrates on
    problems where most actions leave most
    things unchanged.

    A set of ground (variable-free) actions
    can be represented by a single action
    schema.
    
    The schema is a lifted representation-it
    lifts the level of reasoning from
    propositional logic to a restricted subset
    of first-order logic.
    
    For example, here is an action schema for
    flying a plane from one location to
    another:
