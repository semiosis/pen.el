Attitude Determination and Control Subsystem
ADCS
    Sensors and Estimators:
        Sensors are instruments which measure
        various quantities during the flight
        of the satellite. These sensors are
        like eyes and ears of the satellite.
        In this section, we will only consider
        sensors concerning attitude
        determination and control.

        As stated earlier, the purpose of ADCS
        is to determine the orientation of
        satellite with respect to some
        reference frame. This requires
        measurement of various vector
        quantities in the body frame of the
        satellite. This task is performed by
        sensors. For example, sun-sensor
        measures the unit vector in the
        direction of sun from satellite. The
        magnetometer measures local magnetic
        field due to earth. The more detailed
        information about different sensors
        will be given in subsequent sections.

        Although, we want to determine the
        attitude, there is no direct sensor to
        measure it. Thus we have to use
        measurement from different sensors and
        estimate attitude using them. There
        are number of algorithms to achieve
        this.

    Actuators:
        One of the goals of ADCS is to bring
        the satellite in desired orientation
        and maintain it. This requires some
        component which will exert force or
        torque on the satellite body. It is
        called as actuation and is performed
        by actuator. Magnetorquer, reaction
        wheels are some of the actuators
        commonly used in small satellites.
        These will be discussed thoroughly in
        subsequent sections.

    Control Law:
        Control law is a mathematical
        framework which takes sensor inputs,
        reference signal and decides required
        actuation for controlling the plant
        (which is the satellite in this case).
        There are lots of control laws in
        literature. In subsequent sections
        some commonly used laws are described
        (eg. PID). Propagator: The small
        satellite faces very stringent power
        and mass constraints. Thus, sensors
        which consume lot of power for
        operation can not be used
        continuously. In such scenarios,
        computational models are used to
        simulate sensor measurement using
        actual measurement as a initial
        condition. These are called as
        propagator models.

    On Ground Simulations:
        The control system comprising of above
        parts is designed to achieve the
        required control goal. Now, it is
        essential to verify the performance of
        this control system before launching
        the satellite to ensure its success.
        Thus ADCS has to undergo following
        tests:

    Software simulation
        The designed control law is thoroughly
        tested in softwares or programming
        languages like Matlab/SImulink, Python
        etc. The required environmental models
        are generated in software as per need.
        Some existing models can be used and
        are mentioned later. This process is
        iterative and occurs along with design
        itself.

    On-Board In Loop Simulation (OILS)
        In this testing, control law is
        implemented on actual microprocessor
        unlike fully software testing.
        Environmental models, sensor models
        are still simulated in software. This
        testing can be done with Simulink,
        Labview etc.

    Hardware In Loop Simulation (HILS)
        In this testing, control law is coded
        on microprocessor along with actual
        sensor data. This means environment
        experienced in space has to be
        simulated physically, which will bring
        actual sensor in the control loop
        test.
