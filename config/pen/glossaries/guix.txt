substitute
    Guix supports transparent source/binary
    deployment, which means that it can either
    build things locally, or download
    pre-built items from a server, or both.

    We call these pre-built items
    substitutesâ€”they are substitutes for local
    build results.

    In many cases, downloading a substitute is
    much faster than building things locally.
