Antioch
Antioch on the Orontes
    An ancient Greek city on the eastern side
    of the Orontes River.
    
    Its ruins lie near the modern city of
    Antakya, Turkey, to which the ancient city
    lends its name.
    
    Antioch was founded near the end of the
    fourth century BC by Seleucus I Nicator,
    one of Alexander the Great's generals.
    
    The city's geographical, military, and
    economic location benefited its occupants,
    particularly such features as the spice
    trade, the Silk Road, and the Royal Road.
    
    It eventually rivaled Alexandria as the
    chief city of the Near East.
    
    The city was the capital of the Seleucid
    Empire until 63 B.C. when the Romans took
    control, making it the seat of the
    governor of the province of Syria.
    
    From the early 4th century, the city was
    the seat of the Count of the Orient, head
    of the regional administration of sixteen
    provinces.
    
    It was also the main center of Hellenistic
    Judaism at the end of the Second Temple
    period.
    
    Antioch was one of the most important
    cities in the eastern Mediterranean of
    Rome's dominions.
    
    It covered almost 1,100 acres (4.5 km2)
    within the walls of which one quarter was
    mountain, leaving 750 acres (3.0 km2)
    about one-fifth the area of Rome within
    the Aurelian Walls.
    
    Antioch was called "the cradle of
    Christianity" as a result of its longevity
    and the pivotal role that it played in the
    emergence of both Hellenistic Judaism and
    early Christianity.
    
    The Christian New Testament asserts that
    the name "Christian" first emerged in
    Antioch.
    
    It was one of the four cities of the
    Syrian tetrapolis, and its residents were
    known as Antiochenes.
    
    The city may have had up to 250,000 people
    during Augustan times, but it declined to
    relative insignificance during the Middle
    Ages because of warfare, repeated
    earthquakes, and a change in trade routes,
    which no longer passed through Antioch
    from the far east following the Mongol
    invasions and conquests.
