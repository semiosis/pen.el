Green–Tao theorem
    The sequence of prime numbers contains
    arbitrarily long arithmetic progressions.
    In other words, for every natural number
    k, there exist arithmetic progressions of
    primes with k terms.

Mersenne prime
    A prime number of the form 2 p −1, where p
    is also prime number.
