Regression analysis
    A set of statistical processes for
    estimating the relationships between a
    dependent variable (often called the
    'outcome variable') and one or more
    independent variables (often called
    'predictors', 'covariates', or
    'features').

    Primarily used for two conceptually distinct purposes.
    - First, regression analysis is widely
      used for prediction and forecasting,
      where its use has substantial overlap
      with the field of machine learning.
    - Second, in some situations regression
      analysis can be used to infer causal
      relationships between the independent
      and dependent variables.

Exploratory causal analysis
data causality
causal discovery.
    The use of statistical algorithms to infer
    associations in observed data sets that
    are potentially causal under strict
    assumptions.
