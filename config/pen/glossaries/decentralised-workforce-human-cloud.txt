asynchronous communication

    When you send a message without expecting
    an immediate response.
    
    For example, you send an email.
    
    I open and respond to the email several
    hours later.

    When you send a message and the recipient
    processes the information and responds
    immediately.
    
    In-person communication, like meetings,
    are examples of purely synchronous
    communication.
    
    You say something, I receive the
    information as you say it, and respond to
    the information right away.
