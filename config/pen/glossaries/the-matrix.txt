Residual Self Image
RSI
    The subjective appearance and bodily
    structure of a human while inside the
    Matrix.

    The RSI was strongly tied to the
    individual and the base image or body
    itself could not be greatly altered.[1]
    However, any part of the RSI not
    personally tied to the individual,
    typically clothing and anything not part
    of the body, could be easily changed.

    While certain aspects of the RSI were
    normally impossible to change because of
    an individual's subconscious image of
    oneself, the Matrix still offered the
    greatest freedom for anyone with the will
    of mind to truly express their imagined
    personas or just in order to control their
    digital selves.

Mnemosyne
    The goddess of memory in Greek mythology.
    
    "Mnemosyne" is derived from the same
    source as the word mnemonic, that being
    the Greek word mnēmē, which means
    "remembrance, memory".
    
    Mnemosyne is the mother of the nine Muses.
