petticoat
underskirt
    An article of clothing, a type of
    undergarment worn under a skirt or a
    dress.
    
    Its precise meaning varies over centuries
    and between countries.
    
    According to the Oxford English
    Dictionary, in current British English, a
    petticoat is "a light loose undergarment
    ...  hanging from the shoulders or waist".
    
    In modern American usage, "petticoat"
    refers only to a garment hanging from the
    waist.
    
    They are most often made of cotton, silk
    or tulle.
    
    Without petticoats, skirts of the 1850s
    would not have the volume they were known
    for.
