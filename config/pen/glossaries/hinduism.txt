Vishnu
    The preserver and protector of the
    universe.
    
    His role is to return to the earth in
    troubled times and restore the balance of
    good and evil.
    
    So far, he has been incarnated nine times,
    but Hindus believe that he will be
    reincarnated one last time close to the
    end of this world.

avatar
    Jesus is not an avatar of Vishnu.
    
    Avatar is not same as prophet.
    
    An avatar is significantly different from
    a prophet in that every human can attain
    the consciousness of an avatar while a
    prophet is a "chosen" special person whose
    consciousness cannot be attained by
    humans.
    
    One cannot consider Jesus to be an avatar
    because he solves a different problem than
    Vishnu.
    
    He 'redeems' humans from their originally
    sinful nature which Vishnu doesn't.

    In 1969, he formed the movement called
    3HO, (Happy, Healthy, and Holy
    Organization), which later became known as
    Sikh Dharma.

bhakta
    In the Hindu tradition, a bhakta is a
    devotee of God, one whose heart is filled
    with devotion or love (bhakti).

bhakti
    Bhakti is devotion to or love of God.
    
    The term is derived from a Sanskrit root
    meaning “to share.” Hence, it conveys the
    sense of a personal relationship with the
    Lord, expressed in such forms as chanting,
    singing, dancing, and temple worship.

Bhaktivedanta Prabhupada, A.C.
    Following the instructions of his teacher
    in India to carry the message of Krishna
    to the West, Swami A.C.
    
    Bhaktivedanta Prabhupada (1896-1977)
    arrived in New York in 1965 and launched
    the International Society for Krishna
    Consciousness (ISKCON), one of the most
    visible forms of devotion to Krishna in
    the West.

Bochasanwasi Swaminarayan Sanstha (BSS)
    Bochasanwasi Swaminarayan Sanstha is a
    worldwide organization under the
    leadership of Shri Pramukh Swami Maharaj.
    
    It is one of the two major branches of the
    Hindu Swaminarayan movement, honoring
    Swaminarayan, a 19th century Gujarati
    teacher who is seen to be the human
    manifestation of the highest Divine
    reality.

Brahma Kumari
    The Brahma Kumari movement is a worldwide
    spiritual movement founded in India in
    1936 by Prajapita Brahma, with its
    international headquarters at Mount Abu
    and over 3,700 branches worldwide.
    
    Under the leadership of its present head,
    Dadi Prakashmani, the Brahma Kumaris have
    been active in interfaith cooperation
    throughout the world.

Brahman
    Brahman is a term used in the Hindu
    tradition to refer to the Supreme Reality
    that is the source of all being and all
    knowing, pervading and yet transcending
    all that is.
    
    Brahman is said to be one with Atman, the
    inner reality of the self or soul.

Brahmin
    A brahmin is a member of the priestly
    class, charged with the duties of learning
    the Vedas, teaching the Vedas, and
    performing rituals.
    
    It is the highest of the four general
    castes of Hindu society.

caste
    Caste comes from a Portuguese word “casta”
    which was used by early traders to
    describe India’s complex class structure
    of varnas.
    
    The four major inherited varnas are the
    Brahmins (priests), Kshatriyas (kings,
    warriors), vaishyas (merchants), and
    shudras (craftsmen and servants).
    
    The term caste was also used to describe
    hundreds of sub-castes called jatis,
    literally birth-groups.
    
    The caste system distinctive to India
    governs religious, social, and economic
    interactions.
    
    This social structure, while hierarchical,
    is not inflexible; it has changed through
    time and continues to change today.

Chaitanya
    Chaitanya is a 16th century charismatic
    Hindu saint; a devotee of Krishna, who
    urged the simple chanting of the Lord’s
    name as a powerful form of devotion.
    
    The ISKCON or “Hare Krishna” movement is
    one of several devotional movements that
    look to Chaitanya for inspiration.

Chidvilasananda, Gurumayi
    Gurumayi is the spiritual successor to
    Swami Muktananda (1908-1982), the founder
    of Siddha Yoga Dham Associates (SYDA), a
    worldwide meditation movement.

Chinmayananda, Swami
    Swami Chinmayananda (1916-1993) was a
    Vedanta teacher and disciple of the
    influential guru Swami Sivananda.
    
    He founded the Chinmaya Mission in India
    in 1953 and the Chinmaya Mission West in
    1975 to teach the wisdom of the Vedanta
    tradition in the context of Western
    culture.
    
    Today there are some twenty-five Chinmaya
    Mission centers in the United States and
    Canada.

darshan
    In the Hindu tradition, darshan is the
    “auspicious sight” of a deity or even a
    holy person.
    
    Darshan includes both beholding the deity
    and receiving the gaze of the deity.

devi
    Devi is a common term for goddess.
    
    It is used in the Hindu and Jain
    traditions to refer to female divinites,
    many of them localized goddesses.
    
    In the Hindu tradition, Devi also refers
    to the Goddess as the Supreme Being.

Devi, Sarada
    Sarada Devi was the wife of Sri
    Ramakrishna, the 19th century mystic of
    Calcutta.
    
    She was originally a village woman, who
    became worshipped by Ramakrishna not as
    his earthly wife, but as the divine Holy
    Mother.
    
    Her special place in the Ramakrishna
    movement in India and the Vedanta
    Societies in America is perhaps second
    only to Ramakrishna himself.
    
    Her image is invariably present in Vedanta
    Society sanctuaries.
    
    She lived three decades after
    Ramakrishna’s death, dying only in 1920.

Dharma
    Dharma means religion, religious duty,
    religious teaching.
    
    The word dharma comes from a Sanskrit root
    meaning “to uphold, support, bear,” thus
    dharma is that order of things which
    informs the whole world, from the laws of
    nature to the inner workings of
    conscience.
    
    For the Buddhist tradition, the Dharma (or
    Dhamma in Pali) refers especially to the
    teachings of the Buddha.
    
    This body of teachings constitutes one
    element of the “Three Jewels” in which
    Buddhists take refuge: the Buddha, the
    Dharma, and the Sangha (the community).
    
    For Hindus, dharma means righteous
    conduct, religious obligation, or
    religious duty—either the eternal
    obligations (sanatana dharma) incumbent
    upon all humankind, or the obligations
    specific to one’s caste and stage of life
    (varnashrama dharma).

Durga
    Durga is one of the names of the Devi as
    consort of Shiva.
    
    Both a mother and a warrior, she is
    especially known for slaying the buffalo
    demon, Mahisha.
    
    Her autumn festival Durga puja or
    Navaratri is one of North India’s great
    celebrations.

fire altar
    Fire altars have played a central role in
    both Hindu and Zoroastrian religious
    rituals.
    
    In the Hindu tradition, fire altars were
    central to ancient Vedic religious life as
    the place where many yajnas or rituals
    were performed.
    
    The kindling of sacred fire at a fire
    altar continues to be central for many
    Hindu domestic rites, including marriage,
    and for public rites such as the
    consecration of a temple.
    
    In the ancient Zoroastrian tradition, the
    central rites called yasna were and are
    still performed in the presence of the
    purifying fire.
    
    In a fire temple the Afargan or fire vase
    rests upon the altar and contains the
    eternal fire in the presence of which
    Zoroastrians pray.

Gandhi, Mohandas
    M.K.
    
    Gandhi (1869-1948) was one of the great
    religious leaders and social reformers of
    the 20th century.
    
    He came to be called Mahatma, the “Great
    Soul.” Born in western India in Gujarat,
    he studied law in London and then spent
    twenty years with the Indian diaspora
    community in South Africa, where he began
    his work of non-violent social change.
    
    Returning to India, he was a leader in the
    movement for independence from England,
    again resorting to non-violence, which he
    called satyagraha, “holding fast to
    Truth.” His ashrams included people of all
    religions and castes, including
    untouchables, and were models of a society
    where such divisions could be overcome.

Ganesha
    Ganesha is the elephant-headed son of
    Shiva and Parvati and the keeper of the
    thresholds of space and time, to be
    honored at the doorway and at the outset
    of any venture.
    
    He is both the “lord of beginnings” and
    the “remover of obstacles.”

Ganesha Chaturthi
    Ganesha Chaturthi is the year’s great
    festival of Ganesha, celebrated most
    commonly on the fourth day (chaturthi) of
    the waning fortnight of the lunar month of
    August/September.
    
    At the Ganesha Temple in Queens, the day
    includes a procession of the festival
    image of Ganesha through the streets of
    Flushing.
    
    Many American temples observe Ganesha
    Chaturthi.

Goddess
    Goddess is a term used to refer to the
    female deity, either in the singular as
    the supreme divine reality, or in the
    plural as one of many particular or
    localized feminine deities.
    
    In the Hindu tradition, the Goddess refers
    to the very powerful, even supreme Goddess
    known variously as Durga, Kali, or simply
    Devi.
    
    In today’s Pagan traditions, the Goddess
    may refer to one of the ancient female
    deities such as Diana or Isis, or to the
    universal and supreme Goddess known under
    many names.

guru puja
    Guru puja is the honoring of the guru or
    teacher with puja, or ritual devotion.

Guru Purnima
    Guru Purnima is a yearly observance
    honoring the guru or teacher.
    
    It falls on the full moon day (purnima) of
    the lunar month of July/August.

gurukulam
    A gurukulam is a residential school or
    training center where a guru teaches;
    literally, it means the family (kulam) of
    the guru.

Hanuman
    Hanuman is Lord Rama’s foremost devotee
    and servant.
    
    In the epic Ramayana, Hanuman plays a key
    role in the rescue of Rama’s wife, Sita,
    after she had been abducted by the demon-
    king, Ravana.
    
    In Hindu temples Hanuman is always
    present, on bended knee, at Rama’s altar.
    
    He is, in many ways, worshipped more
    widely than Rama, for it is common to
    worship Rama through his closest servant.

Hatha yoga
    Hatha yoga is a form of yoga or
    spiritual/physical discipline giving
    special attention to the postures and
    breathing exercises that release and
    control the energies of the body.
    
    The term is often used in the West to
    refer to the physical-fitness aspects of
    yoga.

haveli
    A haveli is a stately house or palace, a
    Pushti Marga temple.
    
    In this devotional sect founded by the
    teacher (acharya) Vallabha, Krishna dwells
    in the household of the teachers.
    
    In the Swaminarayan tradition, a haveli is
    the residence for female ascetics.

Hinduism
    “Hindu” was originally a word given by the
    Greeks, then the Persians, to the land and
    peoples beyond the Indus or “Sindhu”
    River.
    
    The term “Hinduism” came into common use
    only in the 19th century to describe a
    complex and dynamic pattern of life and
    practice.
    
    The Hindu tradition is more an ethos than
    a set of beliefs.
    
    It includes three major streams of Hindu
    devotion—Vaishnava, Shaiva, and Shakta—and
    a number of distinctive philosophical
    traditions.
    
    Despite great sectarian diversity, there
    are Hindu assumptions about life that do
    have common, although not universal,
    currency.
    
    the universe is permeated with the Divine,
    a reality often described as Brahman; the
    Divine can be known in many names and
    forms; this reality is deeply and fully
    present within the human soul; the soul’s
    journey to full self-realization is not
    accomplished in a single lifetime, but
    takes many lifetimes; one’s course through
    life after life is shaped by one’s deeds.

Holi
    Holi is a Hindu springtime festival,
    marked by rituals of revelry including
    “playing” with colored powder which
    celebrants throw on one another.
    
    In some temples Krishna participates by
    throwing the colors on his devotees.
    
    Holi falls on the first day of the waning
    fortnight of the lunar month of
    March/April.

International Society for Krishna Consciousness
    The International Society for Krishna
    Consciousness (ISKCON), often referred to
    as the Hare Krishna movement, was founded
    by A.C.
    
    Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada (1896-1977)
    who brought his tradition of devotion to
    Krishna to the United States in 1965.
    
    This form of devotion emphasizes the
    powerful simplicity of chanting the Lord’s
    name to express and realize love of God.
    
    ISKCON communities are strictly vegetarian
    and observe a rigorous daily schedule of
    worship and chanting.

Jagannatha
    Jagannatha is Krishna as “Lord of the
    Universe,” especially as he is present in
    the simple, saucer-eyed wooden form
    worshipped in the pilgrimage town of Puri
    in the Indian state of Orissa and beloved
    by worshippers of Krishna both in India
    and the West.
    
    The images of Krishna Jagannatha, his
    sister Subhadra, and his brother Balarama,
    are pulled through the streets of American
    cities in ISKCON’s annual Chariot
    Festivals.

Janmashtami
    Krishna Janmashtami is the Hindu festival
    celebrating the birth (janma) of Lord
    Krishna on the eighth day (ashtami) of the
    waning fortnight of the lunar month of
    August/September.

japa
    Japa is the devotional repetition of a
    sacred syllable, mantra, or divine name,
    either aloud or to oneself.
    
    Some devotees count each repetition on a
    mala or rosary.

jnana
    Jnana is wisdom, transforming knowledge,
    especially the knowledge of the identity
    of the atman or soul and the ultimate
    reality of Brahman.
    
    It is this inner realization to which the
    teachings of the Upanishads point, and it
    is this wisdom which is explicated in
    philosophical systems such as Advaita
    Vedanta.

Kabir
    Kabir was a late 15th and early 16th
    century poet-saint of North India who
    glimpsed and praised the one, formless God
    who could not be confined within the
    religious establishments of either the
    Hindus or the Muslims.
    
    Kabir’s songs are still widely known and
    loved and some of them are included among
    the songs of the saints in the Sikh
    scripture, the Adi Granth.

karma yoga
    Karma yoga means the spiritual discipline
    (yoga) of action (karma): active
    engagement with the concerns and affairs
    of the world, but with a spirit of
    detachment or renunciation, action without
    any ego-attachment to its fruits or
    results.
    
    In the Bhagavad Gita karma yoga is placed
    alongside inner realization (jnana) and
    expressive devotion (bhakti) as one of the
    main spiritual paths.

Kashmir Shaivism
    Kashmir Shaivism is a non-dualist
    philosophical and ritual tradition,
    beginning in about the 10th century in
    Kashmir.

kirtan
    In the religious traditions of India the
    term kirtan refers to singing the praises
    of God in communal worship.

Krishna
    Krishna is one of the most beloved of
    Hindu Gods, sometimes called an avatara of
    Vishnu, but widely worshipped in his own
    right as the Supreme Lord.
    
    The stories of Krishna gather together the
    ancient and heroic cowherd god of India,
    the adviser to Arjuna and teacher of the
    Bhagavad Gita, the divine child, and the
    playful lover of the milkmaids of Vraj.

kumbhabhishekam
    Kumbhabhishekam means the “sprinkling”
    (abhishekam) of the temple with sacred
    waters carried in a “water-pot” (kumbha).
    
    This consecration rite is the most
    important ritual in the life of a newly
    built Hindu temple.
    
    The main rites ordinarily take place in a
    large tent erected adjacent to the new
    temple.
    
    There brick fire altars are constructed so
    that offerings may be made into the fire
    by priests as they chant mantras and
    sacred texts.
    
    The Divine is invoked into the fire, into
    the water, and then the consecrated waters
    are sprinkled over the temple cupolas and
    towers, making the entire temple a
    dwelling of the Divine.

kundalini yoga
    Kundalini is a powerful spiritual energy,
    understood to be concentrated at the base
    of the spine like a coiled serpent.
    
    The discipline of releasing and raising
    that energy to the head where it
    transforms one’s consciousness is called
    kundalini yoga, a spiritual regimen common
    to some Hindu and Buddhist traditions, as
    well as to the Sikh Dharma taught by Yogi
    Bhajan.

Lakshmi
    Lakshmi is the goddess who embodies
    auspiciousness, wealth, and good fortune.
    
    She is often regarded as a wife of Vishnu
    or Narayana and is worshipped especially
    in the fall festival of lights called
    Divali.

Lakshmi Narayana
    The Goddess Lakshmi and Lord Vishnu, also
    called Narayana, are worshipped together
    as the Divine couple.

Laws of Manu
    The Laws of Manu constitute one of the
    classic sources of teaching about Dharma
    in the Hindu tradition.
    
    Dating to the period from about 200 BCE to
    200 CE, this articulation of law or dharma
    begins with the story of creation and then
    covers such subjects as the duties and
    responsibilities of each of the castes
    (varnas) and each of the stages of life
    (ashramas), the special responsibilities
    of kings and of women, and the
    consequences of infractions against
    dharma.

Lokayata
    Lokayata is school of philosophical
    thought that defined itself against
    Hinduism by emphasizing that matter and
    sense data derived from it is the only
    source of knowing and that physical forces
    were active in the world although not
    alive.

Mahabharata
    The Mahabharata is the great epic of
    India, comprising some 18 sections.
    
    It tells the tale of the great battle
    between the Pandavas, understood to be
    sons of the gods, and the Kauravas, their
    cousins, who conspire to deprive the
    Pandavas of their kingdom.
    
    Within the epic of family rivalry and
    battle are included countless myths,
    legends, and teachings about Dharma, such
    as the Bhagavad Gita, which is told by the
    incarnate Krishna to the warrior Arjuna
    just as the battle is about to begin.
    
    The Mahabharata is a treasury of the
    culture and lore of Hindu India.
    
    Emerging over the centuries from
    traditions of oral epic transmission, the
    Mahabharata gained its present form by
    about 400 CE.

mandala
    The Sanskrit word mandala means circle
    and, by extension, the whole world.
    
    It is used in the Hindu and Buddhist
    traditions to refer to the symbolic
    circles that represent the entire world,
    with all its divine energies, in a
    microcosm.
    
    Especially in the Tibetan Vajrayana
    tradition, visualizing the world created
    in the mandala (called kyinkor) with all
    its color and detail becomes a powerful
    and finely-tuned meditation practice.

mandir
    A Hindu temple will be called a mandir in
    northern parts of India or a koyil in the
    south.
    
    There are many styles of temples and
    temple-complexes, but most temples are
    laid out according to precise dimensions
    and proportions and erected to be the
    symbolic embodiments of the Divine on
    earth.
    
    The murti (image) of the deity for whom
    the temple is built is housed in a smaller
    sanctuary or garbha griha (womb-chamber)
    at the very heart of the temple.

Meenakshi
    (also: Minakshi) The material form of
    Goddess Meenakshi is best known as the
    reigning goddess of the popular South
    Indian temple town of Madurai, where her
    large temple complex is at center of town
    built in concentric square processional
    streets around the temple.
    
    She is the bride of Shiva called
    Sundareshvara, the “beautiful Lord,” but
    is also worshipped in her own right.
    
    In the U.S., her first and largest temple
    is in Houston.

moksha
    Moksha means freedom or liberation;
    freedom from the constant round of birth
    and death called samsara.
    
    Many Hindu schools of thought insist that
    jnana, profound self-knowledge or
    knowledge of atman, is the prerequisite of
    moksha.
    
    In the Jain tradition the attainment of
    kevalajnana, the supreme, omniscient
    knowledge of the nature of the universe,
    brings moksha.

monastery
    A monastery is the residence of monks, or
    monastics; the term is commonly used in
    both the Christian and Buddhist
    traditions.
    
    Monasticism refers to the life of work,
    study, and discipline led by monks and
    nuns.

monk
    A monk is a man who renounces worldly life
    and is ordinarily a member of a monastic
    order or community, thereby undertaking a
    special commitment to study, service,
    asceticism, prayer, or disciplined
    spiritual practice.
    
    In the Buddhist tradition, fully ordained
    monks are called bhikkhus, those who beg
    alms, depending upon the laity for their
    food and support.
    
    In the Jain tradition, ordained monks are
    called sadhus or holy ones; they
    traditionally live in close interaction
    with Jain laity, depending upon them for
    food and sustenance.
    
    In the Hindu tradition, a sannyasi is one
    who renounces worldly life, but such
    renunciation has often been an individual
    matter, without a monastic community.
    
    However, the 8th or 9th-century sage
    Shankara is credited with organizing many
    sannyasis, though by no means all, into
    monastic orders.
    
    In the Christian tradition, there have
    been both individual monks (hermits) and
    monks who live in orders or communities
    following a specific rule of life, such as
    the Franciscans or Benedictines.

Muktananda, Swami
    Swami Muktananda (1908-1982) founded the
    Siddha Yoga Dham Associates (SYDA) in
    1974.
    
    By 1976, he had established eighty
    meditation centers and five ashrams, and
    claimed some 20,000 followers in the
    United States.
    
    Swami Muktananda also traveled to other
    parts of the world, spreading the
    teachings of Siddha Yoga Meditation.

murti
    Both Hindus and Jains honor sacred images
    called murtis.
    
    The term murti means form or likeness,
    referring to the material form of a deity
    or divine being as a focus for worship.
    
    These images may be temporary or
    permanently installed, as in a temple.
    
    Through rites of consecration, Hindus
    understand the image as a dwelling of the
    Divine, whom worshippers honor with a
    daily round of hospitality rites.
    
    Jains understand their images of the
    Tirthankaras quite differently: the
    Tirthankaras are not gods and do not dwell
    in the image.
    
    By worshipping the murti of the
    Tirthankara, Jains emulate his qualities,
    purify themselves, and turn the mind
    toward liberation.

Murugan
    Murugan is the divine son of Shiva, also
    known as Skanda or Karttikeya.
    
    There are six popular Hindu temples of
    Murugan in South India, including Palani.
    
    In the U.S., Murugan is present as
    Palaniswami in Concord, California.
    
    There are Murugan temples in such places
    as Yuma, Arizona; Richville, New York; and
    Lanham, Maryland.

Nammalvar
    Nammalvar was a 9th century Tamil poet-
    saint whose poems, called the Tiruvaymoli,
    are considered by the Shri Vaishnavas to
    be “the Tamil Veda.” The image of
    Nammalvar as a great devotee of Vishnu is
    often found in South Indian Vaishnava
    temples.

Narasimha
    Narasimha is the “Man-Lion” avatara,
    (divine descent), of Vishnu.
    
    According to myth, he became manifest in
    this form in order to rescue his devotee
    from an evil king who had a boon that he
    could not be killed by man or beast.
    
    By becoming neither fully man nor beast,
    Vishnu killed him and retrieved the world
    from the reign of the godless king.

Narayana
    Narayana is a name commonly used to refer
    to Vishnu, especially in the form in which
    he lies sleeping on the waters, resting on
    the serpent called Ananta, the “eternal.”

Navaratri
    The fall festival Navaratri (literally,
    “Nine Nights”) is also called Durga Puja,
    the worship of the Goddess Durga.
    
    Over the course of the first nine nights
    of the waxing half of this lunar cycle,
    beautiful images of the goddess are made
    and worshipped.
    
    American Hindus observe Navaratri in a
    variety of ways, including large public
    celebrations with the popular stick-
    dancing called the garba.

North Indian Bhakti
    North Indian Bhakti began in about the
    12th century with the Sanskrit poet
    Jayadeva, when a variety of poet-saints of
    northern India began to create a new
    devotional climate.
    
    This culminated in the 15th and 16th
    centuries with spirited devotional
    movements and vernacular poetry and song
    associated with Chaitanya, Kabir, Mira
    Bai, Vallabha, Tulsi Das, and Surdas.

nun
    A nun is a woman who renounces worldly
    life and is ordinarily a member of a
    monastic order or community, thereby
    undertaking a special commitment to study,
    service, asceticism, prayer, or
    disciplined spiritual practice.
    
    In the Buddhist tradition, fully ordained
    nuns are called bhikkhunis, those who beg
    alms, depending upon the laity for their
    food and support.
    
    The early lineage of bhikkhunis died out
    long ago in the Theravada traditions of
    South Asia, but was preserved in the
    Mahayana traditions of East Asia where
    nuns outnumber monks today in Hong Kong
    and Taiwan.
    
    In the Jain tradition, ordained nuns are
    called sadhvis or holy ones; they have
    preserved monastic life for many centuries
    and their orders flourish in contemporary
    India.
    
    In the Christian tradition, there have
    been nuns since the 4th century, some
    communities living cloistered lives
    entirely apart from the world and others
    involved in the world in vocations of
    service and education.

Om
    The sacred syllable Om, also Aum, is
    regarded as the supreme mantra, the seed
    and source of all wisdom.
    
    The term “Omkara” also refers to this
    great seed and source of all.

Onam Festival
    Onam is the most popular festival of the
    Kerala region of India, falling at the
    lush time of harvest and welcoming back to
    Kerala the ancient legendary king Bali,
    who was a virtuous king, even though he
    was defeated by Vishnu in the form of his
    Vamana (dwarf) avatara.
    
    The famous snake boat races on Kerala’s
    waterways are an important part of this
    festival.
    
    Onam is also observed in immigrant
    communities from Kerala in the U.S.

pandit
    A pandit is a teacher, a scholar, a
    learned person.

Parvati
    Parvati is the “mountain born” goddess,
    daughter of the Himalayas, the spouse of

prana-pratishtha
    Prana-pratishtha, “establishing the
    breath,” is the name of a particular rite
    of sanctification that establishes the
    divine breath of life in a murti or image.
    
    After this rite, the image must be honored
    daily as a divine embodiment, the divine
    guest in the temple.

prashad
    For the religious traditions of India,
    prashad or prasadam refers to God’s
    “grace,” especially as received in return
    for the gifts that have been offered in
    puja.
    
    In the Hindu tradition, after the
    offerings of water, fruit, flowers, and
    the oil lamp have been presented to the
    deity, the officiating priest then
    distributes them among the worshippers as
    forms of prashad.
    
    In the Sikh tradition, prashad is most
    commonly a sweet of wheat flour, sugar,
    and butter that is distributed in communal
    worship as the divine gift of the Guru.

puja
    For the religious traditions of India, the
    term puja simply means “worship..
    
    For Hindus, puja is the sequence of
    hospitality rites through which
    worshippers honor a deity with offerings
    such as water, fruit, a coconut, cloth,
    incense, and an oil lamp, and receive the
    “grace” of God in return.
    
    For Jains, especially Murtipujak Jains,
    puja may be offered before an image of a
    Tirthankara or Jina, but Jains do not
    believe that the beings represented by the
    images actually receive the offerings
    made.
    
    Instead, the acts of worship are among the
    ways in which those who perform them
    purify themselves, emulate the qualities
    embodied in the Jina, and turn the mind
    toward liberation.

pujari
    A pujari is a brahmin Hindu priest
    responsible for the daily worship (puja)
    and care of the deities in the temple

    especially those concerning the Hindu
    deities Vishnu, Shiva, Krishna, and Devi.
    
    Beginning in about the 5th century, the
    Puranas continued to be composed and
    expanded as late as the 15th century.

Pushti Margiya Vaishnava
    The Pushti Marga is the “Path of Grace,” a
    Hindu tradition of Krishna worship focused
    on the child Krishna especially known as
    Shri Nathji.
    
    It was launched by Vallabhacharya
    (1479-1531) and includes lineages of
    teachers called goswamis, who continue his
    tradition to the present day.
    
    Its most important Indian haveli (palace-
    temple) is at Nathdvara in Rajasthan.
    
    In the U.S.
    
    there are Pushti Marga temples or havelis
    in Vraj, Pennsylvania and Sayreville, New
    Jersey.

Radha
    Radha is the beloved consort of Lord
    Krishna, his favoirte among the milkmaids
    or gopis whom he loved and with whom he
    danced.
    
    Radha is seen by some Hindus as Krishna's
    lover, by others as his spouse.

rajagopuram
    The “royal gateway” of a temple is called
    a rajagopuram.
    
    In South Indian temple styles, the tallest
    tower or spire is over the gateway of the
    temple, not over its inner sanctum.
    
    Many large temples have a series of
    gopurams that rise over a successive
    series of gateways.
    
    The rajagopuram is the tallest, standing
    at the outermost gateway of the temple.
    
    It is usually highly ornamented with
    images of divine beings and auspicious
    protective guardians.
    
    In U.S.
    
    temples, the rajagopuram is often the last
    part of the temple to be completed and the
    consecration of the rajagopuram is a great
    festive occasion.

Rama
    Rama is the virtuous king and hero of the
    Hindu epic Ramayana.
    
    He is also considered the seventh avatara
    of Vishnu.

    Sita and brother Lakshmana, with the
    faithful monkey Hanuman kneeling before
    him.

    celebrating the birth of Rama and his
    marriage to Sita.
    
    It is observed on the ninth day (navami)

    of March/April.

Ramakrishna
    Ramakrishna (1836-86) was a Bengali
    mystic, a devotee of the Goddess Kali, who
    also venerated his wife, Sarada Devi, as
    Holy Mother.
    
    In his spiritual experience, he claimed to
    have had the supreme mystical “God-
    realization” of many religious traditions
    and affirmed their unity.
    
    His disciple Vivekananda (1863-1902) was
    very different in temperament, more an
    activist and intellectual.
    
    After Vivekananda’s success at the 1893
    World’s Parliament of Religions, he
    founded both the Ramakrishna Vedanta
    Society in America and the Ramakrishna
    Mission in India in the name of his
    spiritual master.

Ramakrishna Mission
    The Ramakrishna Mission, headquartered at
    Belur Math in Calcutta, was founded by
    Swami Vivekananda in 1897.
    
    Named after Vivekananda’s mystic teacher,
    Ramakrishna (1836-86), its “mission” has
    been to revitalize the Hindu tradition for
    the task of service, education, and
    nation-building.
    
    Monks of the Ramakrishna Mission have also
    supplied direct leadership of America’s
    Vedanta Societies for nearly a century.

Ramayana
    The Ramayana is a Hindu epic telling the
    story of Rama, the heir-apparent to the
    throne of Ayodhya who was forced into
    exile by a court rivalry.
    
    Obedient to dharma, Rama left for life in
    the forest with his wife Sita and his
    brother Lakshmana.
    
    After Sita was abducted by the Demon-King
    Ravana, Rama, with the aid of the loyal
    monkey Hanuman, rescued Sita and slew
    Ravana.
    
    His fourteen years of exile over, he
    returned to Ayodhya to reign as king.
    
    The Sanskrit Ramayana attributed to
    Valmiki is dated between about 200 B.C.E.
    
    and 200 C.E.
    
    There are also regional Ramayanas, the
    most popular being the Hindi Ramayana of
    the poet Tulsi Das in the 16th-17th
    centuries.

Ratha Yatra
    The Ratha Yatra is a “Chariot Pilgrimage,”
    a festive celebration during which the
    image of one of the Gods is taken out of
    the temple and into the streets for a
    procession.
    
    The images consecrated for this purpose
    are special festival images or
    processional images, duplicates of the
    Gods established in the temple.
    
    The ratha or “chariot” is decorated like a
    portable temple for a trip through the
    streets.
    
    Devotees by the hundreds lend a hand to
    pull the deity’s chariot by its long
    ropes.
    
    There is dancing, chanting, and the
    singing of devotional bhajans all along
    the parade route.
    
    Both Krishna and Ganesha have their Ratha
    Yatras in the United States.

Ravidas
    Ravidas was a 16th century poet and
    singer, an outcaste or untouchable whose
    vision of bhakti, the devotional love of
    the Supreme, leveled all caste
    distinctions.
    
    His songs are loved by many, especially
    those who have been considered
    untouchables.
    
    The Ravidas movement continues in India
    and now has a temple in New York.
    
    Some of the songs of Ravidas were also
    included in the Sikh scripture, the Adi
    Granth.

Rig Veda
    The Rig Veda is a collection of more than
    1,000 hymns dating in its oral form to at
    least 1,200 B.C.E.
    
    The hymns are addressed to a variety of
    Vedic gods, with many invoking Agni, the
    sacred fire.
    
    It is the oldest of the four samhitas,
    “collections,” which also include the
    Yajur, Sama, and Atharva Vedas.

sabha
    Sabha is a general term for an assembly, a
    council, or the hall in which such an
    assembly meets.

sadhu
    In the religious traditions of India, a
    sadhu is a holy man, an ascetic who has
    renounced the world.
    
    In the Jain tradition monks (sadhus) and
    nuns (sadhvis) are also called munis,
    literally the “silent” holy ones.
    
    Traditionally, they are supposed to move
    from village to village, accepting only
    what food someone offers them along the
    way.
    
    They go by foot, for travel by vehicles is
    seen to be much more damaging to the
    multitude of tiny life-forms.
    
    During the four months of the monsoon
    season, the monks and nuns settle down in
    various villages in order to avoid harming
    the many organisms that emerge in the
    rain.
    
    It is especially during this time that
    they perform various services, such as
    teaching, for the lay community.

Sarasvati
    Sarasvati is the Goddess of learning,
    arts, and music, often depicted seated on
    a white swan and holding a vina, a
    stringed musical instrument.
    
    She is honored by many Hindus during the
    days of Navaratri, the “Nine Nights” of
    the Goddess.
    
    Students will bring school books to her
    altar for her blessings.

satsang
    Satsang literally means the “community of
    the good,” and refers to those who gather
    together in a religious community for
    chanting, singing devotional songs called
    bhajans, study, or community worship.

Satyanarayana Vratam
    Satyanarayana Vratam is one of the most
    popular of today’s vratas, which are
    religious observances done in fulfillment
    of a vow.
    
    Vratas are usually rites of well-being,
    which involve fasting, ritual, and the
    recitation of the paradigmatic story.
    
    They are done with particular aims in
    mind, such as health or family well-being.
    
    The Satyanarayana Vratam is today gaining
    much popularity in America’s Hindu
    temples.

Shaiva
    (also: Saiva; Shaivite) Shaivism is the
    name for the tradition of those who
    worship Shiva, one of the great Gods of
    the Hindu tradition.

    worships the Goddess.

Shankara
    Shankara was the 9th century philosopher
    who was one of the premier exponents of
    non-dualistic Vedanta, Advaita Vedanta.
    
    His commentaries on the Upanishads, the
    Bhagavad Gita, and the Brahma Sutras are
    well known.
    
    He is also credited with organizing Hindu
    sannyasis (renouncers) into monastic
    orders.

Shiva
    Shiva is one of the great Gods of the
    Hindu tradition.
    
    The name Shiva means the “Auspicious One,”
    although Shiva deliberately embraces and
    transcends what is considered inauspicious
    as well.
    
    He is also called Mahadeva, the “Great
    Lord,” or Vishvanatha, the “Lord of the
    Universe.” Shiva is seen as both creator
    and destroyer, the one who pours forth the
    universe from himself and draws it within,
    once again, at the end of time.
    
    As a Divine dancer, Shiva is Nataraja, the
    “Lord of the Dance,” whose energy and
    balance of his dance are a perfect emblem
    of Shiva’s relentless activity.
    
    Shiva is also imaged as both male and
    female, sometimes in an anthropomorphic
    image: the right half of the body male and
    the left half female.

    burst forth from the earth as a shaft of
    sheer light so that the gods and people
    could worship the Divine radiance in the
    form of the linga.
    
    According to legend, those who stay awake
    through the night to worship Shiva are
    released from many lifetimes of sin.
    
    Shivaratri is observed in most American
    Hindu temples, falling on the 14th day of
    the waning fortnight of the lunar month of
    February/March.

Shrinathji
    Shrinathji is the form of Lord Krishna
    enshrined at the great temple of the
    Pushti Marga tradition at Nathdvara in
    Rajasthan.
    
    Shrinathji is beloved especially as the
    divine child Krishna, but is also
    understood as the Supreme Lord who has
    entrusted himself to human care in the
    palace households, called havelis, which
    are the temples of this tradition.

Siddha Yoga Dham
    Siddha Yoga Dham Associates (SYDA) was
    launched by Swami Muktananda (1908-1982)
    in 1974.
    
    Siddha Yoga teaches that each individual
    has an inner transformative energy, or
    shakti, that is dormant within.
    
    The Siddha Guru can awaken this spiritual
    energy through an initiation called
    shaktipat, which enables the seeker to
    enter deep and joyful states of meditation
    that have a transforming effect on one’s
    life.
    
    The Siddha Yoga movement continues today
    under the leadership of Muktananda’s
    spiritual successor, Gurumayi, an Indian-
    born woman who leads the SYDA central
    ashram in South Fallsburg, New York.

    and was abducted by the demon Ravana.
    
    Rama’s search for Sita and his battle to
    retrieve her form much of the epic story
    of the Ramayana.
    
    She is worshipped along with Lord Rama and
    is significant as the model of a faithful
    wife in the Hindu tradition.

stotra

    spiritual leader of the worldwide
    Bochanasanwasi Swaminarayan Sanstha.
    
    He is the spiritual successor in a divine
    lineage that extends back to Swaminarayan
    in the 19th century.
    
    He is also the administrative leader of
    the worldwide BSS community.

Swaminarayan
    The Swaminarayan Hindu movement began in
    early 19th century Gujarat with a
    religious and social reformer named
    Sahajanand Swami.
    
    It is a devotional bhakti movement,
    focusing on Vishnu in the form of Krishna
    and Radha and also on Sahajanand Swami
    himself, who became known to his followers
    as Swaminarayan, a human form of the
    highest divine reality.
    
    In the last two centuries, the
    Swaminarayan movement has become known for
    its emphasis on social reform and social
    action, as well as its deep devotionalism.
    
    The two main branches of the movement are
    the International Swaminarayan Satsang
    Organization and the Bochasanwasi
    Swaminarayan Sanstha.

Tirupati
    The hilltop temple of Sri Venkatesvara at
    Tirupati in southern Andhra Pradesh is one
    of the most popular of all Hindu
    pilgrimage destinations.
    
    Several million Hindus come to Tirupati
    every year and the Tirupati Tirumalai
    Devasthanams has lent its support to some
    of the temple-building societies in

upanayana
    The upanayana is the rite of passage in
    which one “draws near” the guru (teacher)
    to begin learning the sacred Vedas.
    
    During the ceremony, each boy has his head
    shaved, receives the sacred Gayatri
    Mantra, and receives the “sacred thread,”
    a cord worn across the chest signifying
    one’s qualification for studying the Veda
    and performing the many rituals.
    
    The upanayana is reserved only for the
    upper three varnas or castes, which are
    sometimes called “twice-born” because of
    their eligibility for this rite of
    rebirth.
    
    In ancient India and to a modest degree in
    modern America, girls are also eligible
    for this rite.

Upanishads
    The Upanishads, dating largely from the
    8th to the 6th centuries BCE, are the
    “wisdom literature” of the Vedas.
    
    Most Upanishads take the form of dialogues
    between teachers and students.
    
    They turn from the rites of the fire altar
    that had been the main focus of discussion
    in the earlier Vedic literature to the
    question of the deeper, inner meanings of
    ritual, especially as it can give insight
    into the origin, basis, and support of the
    universe.
    
    The Upanishads and their interpretations
    are sometimes called Vedanta, literally
    the “end of the Vedas.”

Vaishnava
    A Vaishnava or Vaishnavite is a worshipper
    of Vishnu or one of Vishnu’s many forms,
    such as Krishna or Rama, as Supreme Lord.
    
    Vaishnava is also used to name the Hindu
    traditions of Vishnu worship, such as the
    Sri Vaishnava and the Gaudiya Vaishnava
    traditions.
    
    Collectively, they might be called
    Vaishnavism.

Vallabhacharya
    Vallabha or Vallabhacharya (1479-1531) was
    the Hindu philosopher and devotee of
    Krishna who is seen as the founder of

Veda
    Veda means “wisdom” and specifically
    refers to the sacred wisdom of the four
    Vedic collections: Rig, Sama, Yajur, and
    Atharva Vedas.
    
    Associated with each of these Vedas is
    literature called Brahmanas, which are
    concerned especially with rituals, and
    Upanishads, which explore a deeper
    philosophical understanding of the
    universe.
    
    In its broadest sense, the term Veda
    refers to the wisdom and authority to
    which Hindus turn.

Vedanta
    Vedanta means the “end of the Veda” and
    refers to the Upanishads, those teachings
    which investigate the nature of the soul
    and ultimate reality and which are the
    last part of the Vedic corpus.
    
    The term also designates the philosophical
    system of classical Hindu thought that has
    been primarily based on the exegesis of
    the Upanishads (along with the Brahma
    Sutras and the Bhagavad Gita).
    
    Most adherents of Vedanta share the
    following assumptions: Brahman is the
    underlying Reality pervading the universe;
    the transmigration of the soul; and the
    possibility of moksha or liberation from
    this cycle of transmigration, through deep
    insight.
    
    Vedantists do not, however, agree upon the
    relationship between Brahman and Atman
    (the soul).
    
    Some, following Shankara (c.
    
    9th century C.E.), insist upon the
    ultimate nonduality of the two; others
    agree with qualified nondualism of
    Ramanuja (11th century) or with the
    radical dualism of Madhva (13th century).

Vedanta Society
    The Vedanta Society is affiliated with the
    Ramakrishna Order, headquartered at Belur
    Math in Calcutta.
    
    The first Vedanta Society in the United
    States was founded in New York in 1894 by
    Swami Vivekananda (1863-1902).
    
    Vivekananda emphasized both Vedanta
    philosophy and the practice of yoga.
    
    Although the Vedanta Society has remained
    small, it has played an important role as
    the earliest organization to introduce
    Americans to Hinduism and yoga.

Venkateshvara
    Venkateshvara, also known as Balaji, is a
    form of Vishnu or Krishna.
    
    The hilltop temple dedicated to him at
    Tirupati in southern Andhra Pradesh is one
    of the most popular of all Hindu
    pilgrimage destinations and the stories of
    powerful blessings received by pilgrims to
    this site abound.

Vishnu
    Vishnu is one of the great Gods of the
    Hindu tradition.
    
    He is known in the Vedas and comes to be
    famous as the Lord who pervades the entire
    universe.
    
    He is Supreme but wholly auspicious, only
    occasionally displaying the dark side that
    is embraced by Shiva.
    
    Through his divine “descents” or avataras,
    Vishnu rescues the world again and again
    from the rise of powerful counter-forces
    sometimes called demons.
    
    Krishna is the most widely worshipped of
    the avataras, assuming the role of Supreme
    Lord as well.
    
    Vishnu also has many specific localized
    manifestations, such as Sri Venkateshvara
    at Tirupati or Padmanabhaswamy in
    Trivandrum.

Vivekananda
    Vivekananda (1863-1902) was the foremost
    disciple of the great mystic Ramakrishna.
    
    Well educated and articulate in English,
    he spoke at the World’s Parliament of
    Religion in Chicago in 1893, describing
    Vedanta as a rational, spiritual, and
    universal tradition.
    
    He established Ramakrishna Vedanta
    Societies in the United States and the
    more socially-activist Ramakrishna Mission
    in India before his death at thirty-nine
    years of age.

yoga
    Yoga is a Sanskrit word, deriving from a
    verb meaning “to yoke” or “to join.” Body
    and consciousness are joined together in
    the discipline of yoga.
    
    Yoga practice involves ethical restraints,
    the mastery of bodily postures (called
    asanas), the control and direction of the
    breath (called pranayama) and the
    cultivation of mental concentration.
    
    The common image of the yogi (i.e.
    
    practitioner of yoga) seated in a lotus
    posture or standing in a posture of
    reverence, embodies this one-pointed
    stillness and concentration of both body
    and mind.
    
    There are many kinds of yoga that
    emphasize particular forms of spiritual
    discipline.

Yogananda
    Paramahansa Yogananda (1893-1952) was the
    first Hindu teacher of yoga to settle in
    the United States for an extended period,
    some 30 years.
    
    Soon after he came to the United States in
    1920, he began teaching yoga to Americans.
    
    He launched th.
    
    Self-Realization Fellowship (SRF) in 1925.
    
    Yogananda saw yoga as uniting science and
    religion through realization of the unity
    of their underlying principles; he was
    among the first to emphasize the “mind-
    body” relation, especially for health and
    healing.
    
    The popularity of the movement and of
    Yogananda was enhanced with the
    publication of his book, The Autobiography
    of a Yogi (l946).

Yogoda Satsang Society
    Yogoda Satsang Society was founded in
    India by Paramahansa Yogananda
    (1893-1952).
    
    During the 1920s when Yogananda settled in
    Los Angeles, the American organization
    became known as the Self-Realization
    Fellowship.
    
    Yogananda was the first Hindu teacher of
    yoga to settle in the United States for an
    extended period.
    
    The organization he founded has more than
    400 centers in 44 countries.
    
    Since 1925, the organization’s
    international headquarters has been atop
    Mt.
    
    Washington, five miles from downtown Los
    Angeles.
