Xdebug
    [PHP extension]

    Provides debugging and profiling
    capabilities.
    
    It uses the DBGp debugging protocol.

function traces
    [#Xdebug]

    Xdebug allows you to log all function
    calls, including parameters and return
    values to a file in different formats.
    
    Those so-called "function traces" can be a
    help for when you are new to an
    application or when you are trying to
    figure out what exactly is going on when
    your application is running.

    boolean xdebug.auto_trace = false

    When this setting is set to on, the
    tracing of function calls will be enabled
    just before the script is run.
    
    This makes it possible to trace code in
    the auto_prepend_file.

opcode cache
    A system to cache the result of the PHP
    code compilation to bytecode.
    
    This allows to use the bytecode instead of
    compiling on every request.
    
    Different opcode cache systems are
    available, mostly depending on used PHP
    version.
