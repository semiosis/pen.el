reification
reifies
    The process by which an abstract idea
    about a computer program is turned into an
    explicit data model or other object
    created in a programming language.

rational thinking
    Defined as the use of reason, the capacity
    to make sense of things, and the use of
    logic to establish and verify facts.

intuition
unconscious thinking
    Defined as the ability to acquire
    knowledge without the use of reason.

    The ability to understand or know
    something without conscious reasoning.
    
    It is similar to an insight that we have
    regarding a matter.
    
    For instance, have you felt as if
    something is not right, or that something
    bad is about to happen without having any
    concrete facts? This is due to our
    intuition.
    
    We do not have real facts or a rational
    for our feeling, but we feel as if it is
    correct.
    
    When intuition comes to play, we do not
    analyze the situation.
    
    We also do not weigh the pros and cons, we
    just know.

    Think of it this way:
    - Her intuition was telling her that
      something was wrong. 

instinct
    The natural tendency that a person or
    animal has to behave or react in a
    particular way.

    Think of ‘your instincts’ meaning this:
    - I didn’t have as strong a maternal
      instinct as some other mothers.

infinite regress

    As well as asking, ‘What is the answer to
    this new form of the question’, one may
    ask, ‘Is this new question a worthy one to
    investigate?’ This latter question we
    investigate without further ado, thereby
    cutting short an infinite regress.

Issue trees
    Basically maps of problems.
    
    They give you a clear and systematic way
    of looking at the problem you need to
    solve.
    
    They help you break down a big problem
    into smaller, more manageable ones, and
    prioritize certain parts of the problem.
    
    In other words, they're useful for the
    "divide and conquer" strategy.

    Are also great for communicating about a
    problem with others since they provide a
    map of the problem.

    There are two basic kinds of issue trees:

    - Problem trees
      Created by answering "Why?"
    - Solution trees
      Created by answering "How?"

Iceberg model
    Addressing problems only on their event
    level is often not enough.
    
    The real causes are often hidden from
    plain sight.
    
    Iceberg model is a tool that allows you to
    shift your perspective and see beyond the
    immediate events that everyone notices.
    
    It helps you to uncover root causes of why
    those events happen.
    
    That's possible by looking at deeper
    levels of abstraction within the system
    that are not immediately obvious.
