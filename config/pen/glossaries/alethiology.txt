lie
    An 'intentional' falsehood.

falsity
    The fact of being untrue, incorrect, or
    insincere.
    "he exposed the falsity of the claim"

personal spiritual truth
base personal truth
    Personal conception of personal truth.

self-evident
    [#epistemology]

    A self-evident proposition is a
    proposition that is known to be true by
    understanding its meaning without
    proof, and/or by ordinary human reason.

dialectic
    See "dialectic#argumentation".

aletheia
    [#philosophy]

    Truth or disclosure.
    
    It was used in Ancient Greek philosophy
    and revived in the 20th century by the
    philosopher Martin Heidegger.
    
    Aletheia is variously translated:
    - unconcealedness,
    - disclosure,
    - revealing, or
    - unclosedness.

truth value
logical value
    [#logic]
    [#mathematics]

    Value indicating the relation of a
    proposition to truth.

verisimilitude
truthlikeness
    [#philosophy]

    The notion that some propositions are
    closer to being true than other
    propositions.
    
    The problem of verisimilitude is the
    problem of articulating what it takes for
    one false theory to be closer to the truth
    than another false theory.
    
    This problem was central to the philosophy
    of Karl Popper, largely because Popper was
    among the first to affirm that truth is
    the aim of scientific inquiry while
    acknowledging that most of the greatest
    scientific theories in the history of
    science are, strictly speaking, false.
    
    If this long string of purportedly false
    theories is to constitute progress with
    respect to the goal of truth, then it must
    be at least possible for one false theory
    to be closer to the truth than others.

proposition
    A statement or assertion that expresses a
    judgement or opinion.
    "the proposition that high taxation is
    undesirable"

    [#logic]
    [#linguistics]

    A proposition is the meaning of a
    declarative sentence.
    
    In philosophy, "meaning" is understood to
    be a non-linguistic entity which is shared
    by all sentences with the same meaning.

T-schema
truth-schema
    Used to give an inductive definition of
    truth which lies at the heart of any
    realisation of Alfred Tarski's semantic
    theory of truth.
    
    Some authors refer to it as the
    "Equivalence Schema", a synonym introduced
    by Michael Dummett.
    
    The T-schema is often expressed in NL, but
    it can be formalized in many-sorted
    predicate logic or modal logic; such a
    formalisation is called a
    "T-theory."[citation needed] T-theories
    form the basis of much fundamental work in
    philosophical logic, where they are
    applied in several important controversies
    in analytic philosophy.
    
    As expressed in semi-NL (where 'S' is the
    name of the sentence abbreviated to S):
    'S' is true if and only if S.

    Example:
    - 'snow is white' is true if and only if
      snow is white.

Tarksian semantics
    [semantic theory of truth]

    To formulate linguistic theories without
    semantic paradoxes such as the liar
    paradox, it is generally necessary to
    distinguish the language that one is
    talking about (the object language) from
    the language that one is using to do the
    talking (the metalanguage).
    
    In the following, quoted text is use of
    the object language, while unquoted text
    is use of the metalanguage; a quoted
    sentence (such as "P") is always the
    metalanguage's name for a sentence, such
    that this name is simply the sentence P
    rendered in the object language.
    
    In this way, the metalanguage can be used
    to talk about the object language;
    Tarski's theory of truth (Alfred Tarski
    1935) demanded that the object language be
    contained in the metalanguage.

semantic theory of truth
    A theory of truth in the philosophy of
    language which holds that truth is a
    property of sentences.

    The semantic conception of truth, which is
    related in different ways to both the
    correspondence and deflationary
    conceptions, is due to work by Polish
    logician Alfred Tarski.
    
    Tarski, in "On the Concept of Truth in
    Formal Languages" (1935), attempted to
    formulate a new theory of truth in order
    to resolve the liar paradox.
    
    In the course of this he made several
    metamathematical discoveries, most notably
    Tarski's undefinability theorem using the
    same formal technique Kurt Gödel used in
    his incompleteness theorems.
    
    Roughly, this states that a truth-
    predicate satisfying Convention T for the
    sentences of a given language cannot be
    defined within that language.

Kripke's theory of truth
    Based on partial logic (a logic of
    partially defined truth predicates instead
    of Tarski's logic of totally defined truth
    predicates) with the strong Kleene
    evaluation scheme.

truth-value semantics
    [#formal semantics]

    An alternative to Tarskian semantics.
    
    It has been primarily championed by Ruth
    Barcan Marcus, H. Leblanc, and M. Dunn and
    N. Belnap.
    
    It is also called the substitution
    interpretation (of the quantifiers) or
    substitutional quantification.
    
    The idea of these semantics is that
    universal (existential) quantifier may be
    read as a conjunction (disjunction) of
    formulas in which constants replace the
    variables in the scope of the quantifier.
    
    For example, ∀xPx may be read (Pa & Pb &
    Pc &...) where a,b,c are individual
    constants replacing all occurrences of x
    in Px.
    
    The main difference between truth-value
    semantics and the standard semantics for
    predicate logic is that there are no
    domains for truth-value semantics.
    
    Only the truth clauses for atomic and for
    quantificational formulas differ from
    those of the standard semantics.

Liar paradox
    [#philosophy]
    [#logic]

    The classical liar paradox or liar's
    paradox or antinomy of the liar is the
    statement of a liar that they are lying:
    for instance, declaring that "I am lying".
    
    If the liar is indeed lying, then the liar
    is telling the truth, which means the liar
    just lied.
    
    In "this sentence is a lie" the paradox is
    strengthened in order to make it amenable
    to more rigorous logical analysis.
    
    It is still generally called the "liar
    paradox" although abstraction is made
    precisely from the liar making the
    statement.
    
    Trying to assign to this statement, the
    strengthened liar, a classical binary
    truth value leads to a contradiction.
    
    If "this sentence is false" is true, then
    it is false, but the sentence states that
    it is false, and if it is false, then it
    must be true, and so on.

supervaluationism
    [#philosophical logic]

    A semantics for dealing with irreferential
    singular terms and vagueness.
    
    It allows one to apply the tautologies of
    propositional logic in cases where truth
    values are undefined.
    
    According to supervaluationism, a
    proposition can have a definite truth
    value even when its components do not.
    
    The proposition "Pegasus likes licorice",
    for example, is often interpreted as
    having no truth-value given the assumption
    that the name "Pegasus" fails to refer.
    
    If indeed reference fails for "Pegasus",
    then it seems as though there is nothing
    that can justify an assignment of a truth-
    value to any apparent assertion in which
    the term "Pegasus" occurs.
    
    The statement "Pegasus likes licorice or
    Pegasus doesn't like licorice", however,
    is an instance of the valid schema
    {\displaystyle p\vee \neg p}p\vee \neg p
    ("{\displaystyle p}p or not-{\displaystyle
    p}p"), so, according to supervaluationism,
    it should be true regardless of whether or
    not its disjuncts have a truth value; that
    is, it should be true in all
    interpretations.
    
    If, in general, something is true in all
    precisifications, supervaluationism
    describes it as "supertrue", while
    something false in all precisifications is
    described as "superfalse".

alethiology
    Means the study of truth, but can more
    accurately be translated as the study of
    the nature of truth.

major theories of truth
    - substantive
      - consensus

epistemic theories of truth
    [#philosophy]
    [#epistemology]
    [#alethiology]

    Attempts to analyze the notion of truth in
    terms of epistemic notions such as
    knowledge, belief, acceptance,
    verification, justification, and
    perspective.

deflationary theory of truth
    [#theories of truth]

    A deflationary theory of truth is one of a
    family of theories that all have in common
    the claim that assertions of predicate
    truth of a statement do not attribute a
    property called "truth" to such a
    statement.

propositional truth
    If a proposition is true, then we say it
    has a truth value of "true"; if a
    proposition is false, its truth value is
    "false".
    
    For example, "Grass is green", and "2 + 5
    = 5" are propositions.
    
    The first proposition has the truth value
    of "true" and the second "false".

truthmaker theory
    The branch of metaphysics that explores
    the relationships between what is true and
    what exists.
    
    The basic intuition behind truthmaker
    theory is that truth depends on being.
    
    For example, a perceptual experience of a
    green tree may be said to be true because
    there actually is a green tree.

    This is meant to be a modern alternative
    to the "correspondence theory".

    https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/truth-correspondence/

substantive
    Having a firm basis in reality and so
    important, meaningful, or considerable.
    "there is no substantive evidence for the
    efficacy of these drugs"

    Having a separate and independent
    existence.

correspondence
correspondence theories of truth
    Emphasize that true beliefs and true
    statements correspond to the actual state
    of affairs.
    
    This type of theory stresses a
    relationship between thoughts or
    statements on one hand, and things or
    objects on the other.
    
    It is a traditional model tracing its
    origins to ancient Greek philosophers such
    as Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle.
    
    This class of theories holds that the
    truth or the falsity of a representation
    is determined in principle entirely by how
    it relates to "things" by whether it
    accurately describes those "things".

coherence
coherence theory of truth
    For coherence theories in general, truth
    requires a proper fit of elements within a
    whole system.
    
    Very often, though, coherence is taken to
    imply something more than simple logical
    consistency; often there is a demand that
    the propositions in a coherent system lend
    mutual inferential support to each other.
    
    So, for example, the completeness and
    comprehensiveness of the underlying set of
    concepts is a critical factor in judging
    the validity and usefulness of a coherent
    system.
    
    A pervasive tenet of coherence theories is
    the idea that truth is primarily a
    property of whole systems of propositions,
    and can be ascribed to individual
    propositions only according to their
    coherence with the whole.
    
    Among the assortment of perspectives
    commonly regarded as coherence theory,
    theorists differ on the question of
    whether coherence entails many possible
    true systems of thought or only a single
    absolute system.
    
    Some variants of coherence theory are
    claimed to describe the essential and
    intrinsic properties of formal systems in
    logic and mathematics.

pragmatic
pragmatic theory of truth
    The three most influential forms of the
    pragmatic theory of truth were introduced
    around the turn of the 20th century by
    Charles Sanders Peirce, William James, and
    John Dewey.
    
    Although there are wide differences in
    viewpoint among these and other proponents
    of pragmatic theory, they hold in common
    that truth is verified and confirmed by
    the results of putting one's concepts into
    practice.
    
    Peirce defines truth as follows:
        Truth is that concordance of an
        abstract statement with the ideal
        limit towards which endless
        investigation would tend to bring
        scientific belief, which concordance
        the abstract statement may possess by
        virtue of the confession of its
        inaccuracy and one-sidedness, and this
        confession is an essential ingredient
        of truth.

constructivist
social constructivism
    Holds that truth is constructed by social
    processes, is historically and culturally
    specific, and that it is in part shaped
    through the power struggles within a
    community.
    
    Constructivism views all of our knowledge
    as "constructed," because it does not
    reflect any external "transcendent"
    realities (as a pure correspondence theory
    might hold).
    
    Rather, perceptions of truth are viewed as
    contingent on convention, human
    perception, and social experience.
    
    It is believed by constructivists that
    representations of physical and biological
    reality, including race, sexuality, and
    gender, are socially constructed.

consensus
consensus theory of truth
    Consensus theory holds that truth is
    whatever is agreed upon, or in some
    versions, might come to be agreed upon, by
    some specified group.
    
    Such a group might include all human
    beings, or a subset thereof consisting of
    more than one person.
    
    Among the current advocates of consensus
    theory as a useful accounting of the
    concept of "truth" is the philosopher
    Jürgen Habermas.
    
    Habermas maintains that truth is what
    would be agreed upon in an ideal speech
    situation.
    
    Among the current strong critics of
    consensus theory is the philosopher
    Nicholas Rescher.

verity
    A true principle or belief, especially one
    of fundamental importance.
    "the eternal verities"

    Truth.
    "irrefutable, objective verity"
