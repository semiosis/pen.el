mucociliary clearance
MCC
mucociliary transport
    Describes the self-clearing mechanism of
    the airways in the respiratory system.
    
    It is one of the two protective processes
    for the lungs in removing inhaled
    particles including pathogens before they
    can reach the delicate tissue of the
    lungs.
    
    The other clearance mechanism is provided
    by the cough reflex.
    
    Mucociliary clearance has a major role in
    pulmonary hygiene.
