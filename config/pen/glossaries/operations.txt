ntpsec
    https://www.ntpsec.org/

    A secure, hardened, and improved
    implementation of Network Time Protocol
    derived from NTP Classic, Dave Millsâ€™s
    original.
    
    NTPsec, as its name implies, is a more
    secure NTP.
    
    Our goal is to deliver code that can be
    used with confidence in deployments with
    the most stringent security, availability,
    and assurance requirements.

Docker Swarm
Swarm mode
    A Docker Swarm is a group of either
    physical or VMs that are running the
    Docker application and that have been
    configured to join together in a cluster.
    
    Docker swarm is a container orchestration
    tool, meaning that it allows the user to
    manage multiple containers deployed across
    multiple host machines.

    The cluster management and orchestration
    features embedded in the Docker engine.
    
    You can easily deploy to a swarm using a
    file that declares your desired state for
    the app.
    
    Swarm allows you to run your containers on
    more than one machine.
    
    Alternately, you can use Docker Machine to
    create a number of local nodes on your
    development machine.
