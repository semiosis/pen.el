spiritual bypass
spiritual bypassing
    A "tendency to use spiritual ideas and
    practices to sidestep or avoid facing
    unresolved emotional issues, psychological
    wounds, and unfinished developmental
    tasks". The term was introduced in the mid
    1980s by John Welwood, a Buddhist teacher
    and psychotherapist.

individuation
    A process of transformation whereby the
    personal and collective unconscious are
    brought into consciousness (e.g., by means
    of dreams, active imagination, or free
    association) to be assimilated into the
    whole personality.
    
    It is a completely natural process
    necessary for the integration of the
    psyche.

collective conscious
objective psyche
    The collective conscious refers to the
    idea that a segment of the deepest
    unconscious mind is genetically inherited
    and not shaped by personal experience.
    
    This notion was originally defined by
    psychoanalyst Carl Jung.

collective unconscious
    According to Jung's teachings, the
    collective unconscious is common to all
    human beings.
    
    Jung also believed that the collective
    unconscious is responsible for a number of
    deep-seated beliefs and instincts, such as
    spirituality, sexual behavior, and life
    and death instincts.

preconscious
    Preconscious is the loci preceding
    consciousness.
    
    Thoughts are preconscious when they are
    unconscious at a particular moment, but
    are not repressed.

    "This mystery of what the puppeteer is
    doing is probably preconscious. We will
    not get access to it through conscious
    introspection."

repression
    A key concept of psychoanalysis, where it
    is understood as a defence mechanism that
    "ensures that what is unacceptable to the
    conscious mind, and would if recalled
    arouse anxiety, is prevented from entering
    into it."

personal mythology
    The individual's evolving construction of
    inner reality.

    An individual's fundamental stories for
    making sense and meaning of the world.
    
    According to Dr.  David Feinstein and Dr.
    Stanley Krippner, "A personal myth is a
    constellation of beliefs, feelings,
    images, and rules—operating largely
    outside of conscious awareness—that
    interprets sensations, constructs new
    explanations, and directs behavior.
    
    ...Personal myths speak to the broad
    concerns of identity (Who am I?),
    direction (Where am I going?), and purpose
    (Why am I going there?).
    
    For an internal system of images,
    narratives, and emotions to be called a
    personal myth, it must address at least
    one of the core concerns of human
    existence."

personal myth
    The central story behind the various
    episodes of one's life.
    
    Personal myths, like cultural myths, are
    stories that never were, but are always
    happening.
    
    Their impact is profound because they
    operate largely outside our conscious
    awareness.

Jungian archetypes
    Defined as universal, primal symbols and
    images that derive from the collective
    unconscious, as proposed by Carl Jung.
    
    They are underlying base forms, or the
    archetypes-as-such, from which emerge
    images and motifs such as the mother, the
    child, the trickster, and the flood among
    others
