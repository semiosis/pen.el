Conflict-free replicated data type
CRDT
    [data structure]

    A data structure which can be replicated
    across multiple computers in a network,
    where the replicas can be updated
    independently and concurrently without
    coordination between the replicas, and
    where it is always mathematically possible
    to resolve inconsistencies that might come
    up.
