Acropolis
Acropolis of Athens
    An ancient citadel located on a rocky
    outcrop above the city of Athens and
    contains the remains of several ancient
    buildings of great architectural and
    historic significance, the most famous
    being the Parthenon.
    
    The word acropolis is from the Greek words
    ἄκρον (akron, "highest point, extremity")
    and πόλις (polis, "city").
    
    Although the term acropolis is generic and
    there are many other acropoleis in Greece,
    the significance of the Acropolis of
    Athens is such that it is commonly known
    as "The Acropolis" without qualification.
    
    During ancient times it was known also
    more properly as Cecropia, after the
    legendary serpent-man, Cecrops, the
    supposed first Athenian king.
