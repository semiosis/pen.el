Gemini
    [protocol]

    The Gemini protocol is an application
    layer protocol for distributed hypertext
    information systems that provides access
    to simple, primarily textual documents in
    Gemini space.

    This is done with contemporary
    technologies such as TLS, thereby
    improving privacy and user agency relative
    to the Web.

Finger user information
    [protocol]

    Simple network protocol for the exchange
    of human-oriented status and user
    information.

    Finger daemon runs on TCP port 79. The
    client will (in the case of remote hosts)
    open a connection to port 79. An RUIP
    (Remote User Information Program) is
    started on the remote end of the
    connection to process the request. The
    local host sends the RUIP one line query
    based upon the Finger query specification,
    and waits for the RUIP to respond. The
    RUIP receives and processes the query,
    returns an answer, then initiates the
    close of the connection. The local host
    receives the answer and the close signal,
    then proceeds to close its end of the
    connection.

Name/Finger
    [protocol]

    Simple network protocol for the exchange
    of human-oriented status and user
    information.

    Based on Request for Comments document RFC
    742 (December 1977) as an interface to the
    name and finger programs that provide
    status reports on a particular computer
    system or a particular person at network
    sites.
