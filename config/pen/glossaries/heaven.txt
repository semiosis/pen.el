Empyrean Heaven
Empyrean
    The place in the highest heaven, which was
    supposed to be occupied by the element of
    fire (or aether in Aristotle's natural
    philosophy).
    
    The word derives from the Medieval Latin
    empyreus, an adaptation of the Ancient
    Greek empyros (ἔμπυρος), meaning "in or on
    the fire (pyr)".
    
    The Empyrean was thus used as a name for
    the incorporeal "heaven of the first day",
    and in Christian literature for the
    dwelling-place of God, the blessed,
    celestial beings so divine they are made
    of pure light, and the source of light and
    creation.
    
    Notably, at the very end of Dante's
    Paradiso, Dante visits God in the
    Empyrean.

empyreal
    The word 'Empyrean' is used both as a noun
    and as an adjective, but empyreal is an
    alternate adjective form.
