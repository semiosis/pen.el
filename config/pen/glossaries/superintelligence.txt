Orthogonality Thesis

    States that an artificial intelligence can
    have any combination of intelligence level
    and goal, that is, its Utility Functions
    and General Intelligence can vary
    independently of each other.
    
    This is in contrast to the belief that,
    because of their intelligence, AIs will
    all converge to a common goal.
    
    The thesis was originally defined by Nick
    Bostrom in the paper "Superintelligent
    Will", (along with the instrumental
    convergence thesis).
    
    For his purposes, Bostrom defines
    intelligence to be instrumental
    rationality.
