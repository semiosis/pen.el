genetic algorithm
    When you're solving a problem, how do you
    know if the answer you've found is
    correct?

    A specific approach to optimization
    problems that can estimate known solutions
    and simulate evolutionary behavior in
    complex systems.

    In many domains, there is a single correct
    answer.

    A mathematical function may have a global
    maximum or other well-defined attributes.

    However, other problems, like how a cell
    behaves in a petri dish, do not have clear
    solutions.

    Enter evolution, which does not design
    towards a known solution but optimizes
    around constraints.

        digraph g{
            "Initialize population" -> "Fitness function"
            "Fitness function" -> Selection
            Selection -> Reproduction
            Reproduction -> Terminations
            Reproduction -> "While Not Termination Condition"
            "While Not Termination Condition" -> "Fitness function"
        }

crossover
recombination
    A genetic operator used to combine the
    genetic information of two parents to
    generate new offspring.
    
    It is one way to stochastically generate
    new solutions from an existing population,
    and analogous to the crossover that
    happens during sexual reproduction in
    biology.
    
    Solutions can also be generated by cloning
    an existing solution, which is analogous
    to asexual reproduction.
    
    Newly generated solutions are typically
    mutated before being added to the
    population.
