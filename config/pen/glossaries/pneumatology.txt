pneumatology
    Refers to a particular discipline within
    Christian theology that focuses on the
    study of the Holy Spirit.
    
    The term is derived from the Greek word
    Pneuma, which designates "breath" or
    "spirit" and metaphorically describes a
    non-material being or influence.

pneuma
    The Spirit in the Greek version of this
    text is called pneuma, which translates as
    breath.
    
    It was the breath of God that hovered over
    the lifeless void, the breath that
    animated the dark waters with a life it
    had not yet known.
    
    The Spirit was the catalyst for life in
    the space of that which was not-life.
