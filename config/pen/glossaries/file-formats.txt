glTF
    A standard file format for three-
    dimensional scenes and models.
    
    A glTF file uses one of two possible file
    extensions: .gltf or .glb.
    
    Both .gltf and .glb files may reference
    external binary and texture resources.
    
    Alternatively, both formats may be self-
    contained by directly embedding binary
    data buffers.
