musicology
    The scholarly analysis and research-based
    study of music.
    
    Musicology traditionally is divided in
    three main branches: historical
    musicology, systematic musicology and
    ethnomusicology.

Polyphony
    A type of musical texture consisting of
    two or more simultaneous lines of
    independent melody, as opposed to a
    musical texture with just one voice,
    monophony, or a texture with one dominant
    melodic voice accompanied by chords,
    homophony.
