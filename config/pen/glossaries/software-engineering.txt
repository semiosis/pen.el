You aren't gonna need it
    A principle of extreme programming that
    states a programmer should not add
    functionality until deemed necessary.

    "Always implement things when you actually
    need them, never when you just foresee
    that you need them."

    A discipline that incorporates aspects of
    software engineering and applies them to

    According to Ben Treynor, founder of
    Google's Site Reliability Team, SRE is
    "what happens when a software engineer is
    tasked with what used to be called
    operations."

essential complexity
    https://www.simplethread.com/why-does-it-take-so-long-to-build-software/

    This is the complexity that is wrapped up
    in the problem.
    
    You can’t solve the problem without
    tackling this complexity.
    
    This is also sometimes referred to as
    inherent complexity.

accidental complexity
    https://www.simplethread.com/why-does-it-take-so-long-to-build-software/

    This is the complexity that comes along
    with the approach and tools that you use
    to solve a problem.
    
    This complexity isn’t part of the actual
    problem you’re solving, this is the
    complexity that you bring in with your
    solution.
    
    This is sometimes referred to as
    incidental complexity.
