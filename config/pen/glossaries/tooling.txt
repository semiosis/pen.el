    that is done by examining the code without

git-filter-repo
git filter-repo
    A versatile tool for rewriting history,
    which includes capabilities I have not
    found anywhere else.
    
    It roughly falls into the same space of
    tool as git filter-branch but without the
    capitulation-inducing poor performance,
    with far more capabilities, and with a
    design that scales usability-wise beyond
    trivial rewriting cases.
    
    git filter-repo is now recommended by the
    git project instead of git filter-branch.
