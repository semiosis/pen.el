ASDF
asdf
    It's like make.

    Not a tool to build or run Common Lisp
    software from the Unix command-line. For
    that, you want cl-launch, buildapp, or
    roswell.

combinations
    combinations.cl =(echo -n "hi\nyo") =(echo -n "1\n2")

ensure-lisp
    00:32 < makomo> libertyprime: your LIFT-TO-LIST is Alexandria's ENSURE-LIST

apply
    Use apply when I want to expand a list to be the arguments for another function.
        ,@
        apply

cdr
    Pronounced "could-er".

dotted pair notation
    '(1 2 3)
    is written as:
    '(1 . (2 . (3 . nil)))

    They are equivalent.

    `(1 2)
    is written as:
    '(1 . (2))

elisp
emacs lisp
    A lisp-2 with user-defined macros. A
    simple parser cannot detect if e.g.

    `(foo (let ...))`

    a function call with a `let` expression
    argument, or a macro call where `let`
    means something else.
