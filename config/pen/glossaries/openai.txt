Multimodal Neurons
    We’ve discovered neurons in CLIP that
    respond to the same concept whether
    presented literally, symbolically, or
    conceptually.
    
    This may explain CLIP’s accuracy in
    classifying surprising visual renditions
    of concepts, and is also an important step
    toward understanding the associations and
    biases that CLIP and similar models learn.
