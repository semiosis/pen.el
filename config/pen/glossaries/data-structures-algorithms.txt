ephemeron
    A data structure that solves two related
    problems in garbage collected systems.
    
    On the one hand, an ephemeron provides a
    notification when some object is about to
    be collected.

    On the other hand, an ephemeron allows
    data to be associated with some object
    without creating a reference to that
    object that will prevent the object from
    being collected.
    
    An ephemeron is a key-value pair, where
    the key is the object that the ephemeron
    guards, notifying the system when that
    object is collectable, and the value can
    be any data associated with the object
    such as a property list, and which may be
    emptyOn the other hand, an ephemeron
    allows data to be associated with some
    object without creating a reference to
    that object that will prevent the object
    from being collected.

Dijkstra's algorithm
Dijkstra's Shortest Path First algorithm
SPF algorithm
    [algorithm]

    Finds the shortest path.

    An algorithm for finding the shortest
    paths between nodes in a graph, which may
    represent, for example, road networks.

Heaps
    Used in many famous algorithms such as
    Dijkstra's algorithm for finding the
    shortest path, the heap sort sorting
    algorithm, implementing priority queues,
    and more.
    
    Essentially, heaps are the data structure
    you want to use when you want to be able
    to access the maximum or minimum element
    very quickly.

Radix tree
Radix trie
Compact prefix tree
    A data structure that represents a
    space-optimized trie in which each node
    that is the only child is merged with its
    parent.

search tree
    an ordered tree data structure used to
    store a dynamic set or associative array
    where the keys are usually strings.

trie
digital tree
prefix tree
    [search tree]
        
    Unlike a binary search tree, no node in
    the tree stores the key associated with
    that node; instead, its position in the
    tree defines the key with which it is
    associated.
    
    All the descendants of a node have a
    common prefix of the string associated
    with that node, and the root is associated
    with the empty string.

segment tree
statistic tree
    A tree data structure used for storing
    information about intervals, or segments.
    
    It allows querying which of the stored
    segments contain a given point.
    
    It is, in principle, a static structure;
    that is, it's a structure that cannot be
    modified once it's built.
    
    A similar data structure is the interval
    tree.

Skip list
    - sorted

    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypod5jeYzAU

    The idea is simple, we create multiple
    layers in a sorted list so that we can
    skip some nodes.

    A data structure that allows search
    complexity as well as insertion complexity
    within an ordered sequence of elements.
    
    Thus it can get the best features of an
    array while maintaining a linked list-like
    structure

treap
    A binary tree in which every node has both
    a search key and a priority, where the
    inorder sequence of search keys is sorted
    and each node's priority is smaller than
    the priorities of its children.

    In other words, a treap is simultaneously
    a binary search tree for the search keys
    and a (min-)heap for the ...

zip tree
    A form of randomized binary search tree.

    One can view a zip tree as a treap (Seidel
    and Aragon 1996) in which priority ties
    are allowed and in which insertions and
    deletions are done by unmerging and
    merging paths ("unzipping" and "zipping")
    rather than by doing rotations.

    Alternatively, one can view a zip tree as
    a binary-tree representation of a skip
    list (Pugh 1990). Doing insertions and
    deletions by unzipping and zipping instead
    of by doing rotations avoids some pointer
    changes and can thereby improve
    efficiency.

    Representing a skip list as a binary tree
    avoids the need for nodes of different
    sizes and can speed up searches and
    updates. Zip trees are at least as simple
    as treaps and skip lists but offer
    improved efficiency. Their simplicity
    makes them especially amenable to
    concurrent operations.
