    by splitting them into multiple smaller
    strings transparently.

async
await
async function
    A function declared with the async
    keyword.
    
    Async functions are instances of the
    AsyncFunction constructor, and the await
    keyword is permitted within them.
    
    The async and await keywords enable
    asynchronous, promise-based behavior to be
    written in a cleaner style, avoiding the
    need to explicitly configure promise
    chains.
