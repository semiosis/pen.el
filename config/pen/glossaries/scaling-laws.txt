Strength to Weight Ratio
    One property that is affected by SA/V is
    the strength to weight ratio.
    
    Your text approaches this argument from a
    biological standpoint.
    
    I'm instead going to address it from a
    materials science angle.

    The equation for an applied stress (σ) to
    an resulting strain (ε) is:

        σ = F/A = Eε = E(Δl/l)

        pf-convert-ascii-to-latex-equation/1

        \sigma = \frac{F}{A} = \epsilon = \frac{1}{A}\sqrt{\frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N \left(\frac{l_i - \overline{l}}{\Delta l}\right)^2}

    Here E is the Young's modulus for the
    material. This is something you can look
    up in tables, which changes from material
    to material.
