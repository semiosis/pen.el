GitOps
    [methodology]

    https://about.gitlab.com/topics/gitops/

    An operational framework that takes DevOps
    best practices used for application
    development such as version control,
    collaboration, compliance, and CI/CD
    tooling, and applies them to
    infrastructure automation.

    GitOps is not a single product, plugin, or
    platform.
    
    There is no one-size-fits-all answer to
    this question, as the best way for teams
    to put GitOps into practice will vary
    depending on the specific needs and goals
    of the team.
    
    However, some tips on how to get started
    with GitOps include:
    - using a dedicated GitOps repository for
      all team members to share configurations
      and code,
    - automating the deployment of code
      changes, and
    - setting up alerts to notify the team
      when changes occur.

Self-healing
    The property that enables a system to
    perceive that it is not operating
    correctly and, without (or with) human
    intervention, make the necessary
    adjustments to restore itself to normalcy.

swarm
    [docker]

    Example:
    - Assign _N_ managers for the Docker Swarm
    - Add _M_ nodes or ‘workers’ to the Swarm
    - Run a test service across all machines

    Anybody that is already familiar with
    Docker knows the limitations of running
    standalone containers in production.
    
    Containers are ephemeral and without
    proper scheduling and orchestration they
    may fail or stop running.
    
    Docker Swarm solves many of these
    challenges by introducing powerful
    container orchestration that allows
    services to be scheduled across multiple
    hosts.
    
    Services can be scheduled across multiple
    hosts in the Swarm and each service may
    run multiple containers, ensuring maximum
    reliability and performance.

Serverless computing
    https://landscape.cncf.io/category=continuous-integration-delivery&format=serverless&grouping=no

    A cloud computing execution model in which
    the cloud provider runs the server, and
    dynamically manages the allocation of
    machine resources.
    
    Pricing is based on the actual amount of
    resources consumed by an application,
    rather than on pre-purchased units of
    capacity.

Kubernetes
    An open-source system for automating
    deployment, scaling, and management of
    containerized applications.

Docker
    A container management that can
    consistently run software as long as a
    containerization system exists.

overcommited
    Oblige (someone) to do more than they are
    capable of, especially to repay a loan
    they cannot afford.

    Allocate more (resources) to a purpose
    than can be provided.

domain controller
DC
    A server computer that responds to
    security authentication requests within a
    computer domain.
    
    It is a server on a network that is
    responsible for allowing host access to
    domain resources.
    
    It authenticates users, stores user
    account information and enforces security
    policy for a domain.
