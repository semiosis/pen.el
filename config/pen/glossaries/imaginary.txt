metaspacetime
    [#imaginary]
    [#reality]

    The concept of metaspacetime is spacetime
    plus plausible continuations of it
    stemming from any point in the spacetime.

    It is similar to the notion of the
    multiverse.
    
    However, where the term multiverse would
    usually mean possible realities stemming
    from this reality, or stemming from any
    point in the observer's worldline,
    metaspacetime encapsulates all potential
    multiverses from from all observers at any
    point in their worldlines.
