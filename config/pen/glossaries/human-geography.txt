Italian Riviera
    The Italian Riviera, synonymous with
    Italy's Liguria region, is a crescent-
    shaped strip of Mediterranean coastline
    straddling between the south of France and
    Tuscany.
    
    Its eastern half, the Riviera di Levante,
    is defined by its rugged cliffs, turquoise
    coves and pastel seaside towns, including
    the colorful Cinque Terre fishing
    villages, as well as stylish resort areas
    such as Portofino and Santa Margherita
    Ligure.
