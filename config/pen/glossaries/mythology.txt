The Chimera
Chimaera
    According to Greek mythology, was a
    monstrous fire-breathing hybrid creature
    of Lycia in Asia Minor, composed of the
    parts of more than one animal.
    
    It is usually depicted as a lion, with the
    head of a goat protruding from its back,
    and a tail that might end with a snake's
    head.
    
    The term "chimera" has come to describe
    any mythical or fictional creature with
    parts taken from various animals, to
    describe anything composed of very
    disparate parts, or perceived as wildly
    imaginative, implausible, or dazzling.
