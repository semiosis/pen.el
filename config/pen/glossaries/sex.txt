Tantra
    In Sanskrit, the word tantra means:
    - 'woven together'.
    
    People who practice Buddhist and Hindu
    meditation may also practice tantric sex
    as a way to “weave” the physical with the
    spiritual.
    
    This practice brings together spirituality
    and sexuality and emphasizes the
    importance of intimacy during a sexual
    experience.

Neotantra
navatantra
tantric sexuality
    The modern, Western misinterpretation of
    tantra associated with new religious
    movements.
    
    This includes both New Age and modern
    Western interpretations of traditional
    Hindu and Buddhist tantric sex.
    
    Some of its proponents refer to ancient
    and traditional texts and principles, and
    many others use tantra as a catch-all
    phrase for "sacred sexuality", and may
    incorporate unorthodox practices.
    
    In addition, not all of the elements of
    Indian tantric practices are used in
    neotantra, in particular the reliance on a
    guru.
    
    As interest in Tantra has grown in the
    West, its perception has deviated from the
    Tantric traditions.
    
    It was seen as a "cult of ecstasy",
    combining sexuality and spirituality to
    change Western attitudes towards sex.
    
    Hence for many modern readers tantra is
    now synonymous with "spiritual sex" or
    "sacred sexuality," a belief that sex
    should be recognized as a sacred act
    capable of elevating its participants to a
    higher spiritual plane.
