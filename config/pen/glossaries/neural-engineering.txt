neuroprosthesis
neuroprosthetics
    A discipline related to neuroscience and
    biomedical engineering concerned with
    developing neural prostheses.
    
    They are sometimes contrasted with a
    brainâ€“computer interface, which connects
    the brain to a computer rather than a
    device meant to replace missing biological
    functionality.

neural engineering
    A discipline within biomedical engineering
    that uses engineering techniques to
    understand, repair, replace, or enhance
    neural systems.
    
    Neural engineers are uniquely qualified to
    solve design problems at the interface of
    living neural tissue and non-living
    constructs.
