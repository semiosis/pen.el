linear transformation
    [operation]

    Stretch, squeeze, rotate or otherwise
    change all parts of an object in the same
    way.

    Represented by rectangular arrays of
    numbers called matrices.

    One matrix might rotate an object by 90
    degrees; another might flip it upside down
    and shrink it in half.
