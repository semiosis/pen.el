Bundle
    This is actually Go, Juju, etc.

    If I see a codelingo.yaml file named
    'bundle' anywhere, I should change this.

Tenet
    This is the name of both the
    codelingo.yaml file and the individual
    tenets within.

    Technically, it's NOT the name of the
    codelingo.yaml file.

    Neither should the codelingo.yaml file be
    called a 'principle'.

    There needs to be a name for it though.

    It's a set of tenets and its purpose is to
    be placed into a repository.

Flow
    A workflow, automated by CodeLingo.

    Underpinned by Tenets.

    A request is made in the form of a protobuf message.
    vim +/"req := &flow.ReviewRequest{" "$HOME/go/src/github.com/codelingo/lingo/app/commands/review.go"

    The request arrives here. -- the yaml file is still loaded as a string only.
    vim +/"func RequestReview" "$HOME/go/src/github.com/codelingo/lingo/app/commands/review/review.go"

Review Flow
    Codelingo's flagship flow (ie. workflow),

    An action in github.

    Check every new line of code in all pull
    requests and comment on any code that
    breaks a Tenet.

    Automatically reviews a repository's pull
    requests.
    
        ie. to conform to its project specific
        patterns.

Fact
    Non-leaf node of CLQL.

json dump
    Currently it serves no real purpose for
    the CLI tool, but it could be used by the
    user to integrate into another flow.

    For each result in the JSON dump, send an
    email to someone.

    These are the guys that made Jenkins X.

Kibana
    Log Engine.

    Look at pods that are going slow and
    filter down to find the pods which are
    going slowly.

schema
    Usually refers to the graphql schema for
    CLQL.

    Some of the CLQL basic facts are from the
    graphql schema.

fission
    Service function engine.

    We want to remove this and rely on
    autoscaling of the Kubernetes cluster
    instead.

CLAIR
    Responsible for co-ordinating reviews on
    repositories.

RR
Review Request
    I coined this.
