intent vs goal
    Some chatbot tools use the word intent to
    refer to the user goal.

    This is confusing because only some
    messages tell you what a userâ€™s goal is.

dialogue elements
    - highest level:
      user goals

    - middle level:
      dialogue elements

    - lowest level:
      intents, entities, actions, slots, and
      templates.

Rasa Core
    Essentially generates the reply message
    for the chatbot.
    
    It takes the output of Rasa NLU (intent
    and entities) and applies ML models (which
    you can select from) to generate a reply.
