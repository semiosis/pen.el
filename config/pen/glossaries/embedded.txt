OpenOCD
Open On-Chip Debugger
    Open-source software that interfaces with
    a hardware debugger's JTAG port.

    OpenOCD provides debugging and in-system
    programming for embedded target devices.

    OpenOCD provides the ability to flash NAND
    and NOR FLASH memory devices that are
    attached to the processor on the target
    system.

RTT
Real Time Transfer
    https://www.segger.com/products/debug-probes/j-link/technology/about-real-time-transfer/

    With RTT it is possible to output
    information from the target
    microcontroller as well as sending input
    to the application at a very high speed
    without affecting the target's real time
    behavior.

    SEGGER RTT can be used with any J-Link
    model and any supported target processor
    which allows background memory access,
    which are Cortex-M and RX targets.

    RTT supports multiple channels in both
    directions, up to the host and down to the
    target, which can be used for different
    purposes and provide the most possible
    freedom to the user.

JTAG
    (named after the Joint Test Action Group
    which codified it) is an industry standard
    for verifying designs and testing printed
    circuit boards after manufacture.

    JTAG implements standards for on-chip
    instrumentation in electronic design
    automation (EDA) as a complementary tool
    to digital simulation.

defmt
de format
    Short for "deferred formatting".

    A highly efficient logging framework that
    targets resource-constrained devices, like
    microcontrollers.

    Efficient, deferred formatting for logging
    on embedded systems
