Temple Mount
    Usually considered to be the holiest site
    in Judaism.
    
    In Judaic tradition, it figures as the
    place where God's divine presence was
    manifested more than in any other place,
    and is the place Jews turn towards during
    prayer.

cistern
    A waterproof receptacle for holding
    liquids, usually water.
    
    Cisterns are often built to catch and
    store rainwater.
    
    Cisterns are distinguished from wells by
    their waterproof linings.
    
    Modern cisterns range in capacity from a
    few litres to thousands of cubic metres,
    effectively forming covered reservoirs.

El Shaddai
Shaddai
    One of the names of the God of Israel.
    
    El Shaddai is conventionally translated
    into English as God Almighty (Deus
    Omnipotens in Latin), but its original
    meaning is unclear.
    
    The translation of El as "God" or "Lord"
    in the Ugaritic/Canaanite language is
    straightforward, as El was the supreme god
    of the ancient Canaanite religion.
    
    The literal meaning of Shaddai, however,
    is the subject of debate.
    
    The form of the phrase El Shaddai fits the
    pattern of the divine names in the Ancient
    Near East, exactly as is the case with
    names like "'El Olam", "'El Elyon" or "'El
    Betel".
