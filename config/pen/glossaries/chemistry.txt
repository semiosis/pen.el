substituent
    One or a group of atoms that replaces (one
    or more) atoms, thereby becoming a moiety
    in the resultant (new) molecule.

radical
    Any atom or molecule with a lone electron
    in an outermost valence shell.

radical pair
    A pair of radicals connected in a very
    special way; Their unpaired valence
    electrons are entangled.

substituent
    An atom or group of atoms taking the place
    of another atom or group or occupying a
    specified position in a molecule.
    "displacement of alkyl substituents"

Anisotropy
    The property of a material which allows it
    to change or assume different properties
    in different directions as opposed to
    isotropy.

    The property of substances to exhibit
    variations in physical properties along
    different molecular axes. It is seen in
    crystals, liquid crystals and, less
    commonly, in liquids. For example,
    consider the primitive cubic crystal
    lattice structure shown here.

polymorphism

    “Salt is just our first model substance to
    probe the fundamentals of nucleation
    events,” said University Professor Eiichi
    Nakamura. “Salt only crystallizes one way.
    But other molecules, such as carbon, can
    crystallize in multiple ways, leading to
    graphite or diamond. This is called
    polymorphism and no one has seen the early
    stages of the nucleation that leads to it.
    I hope our study provides the first step
    in understanding the mechanism of
    polymorphism.”

burning
    Two atoms or molecules will combine and
    release energy.

    Usually one of the two molecules is oxygen
    or something else chemically like it
    called an oxidizer. 

    The simplest burning process is the
    burning of hydrogen.

    Water is burnt hydrogen.

donor atom
the donor atom
    The/an atom within the ligand that is
    attached to the Lewis acid centre.
    
    The coordination number is the number of

    A macrocycle has multiple donor atoms.

kinetics
Chemical kinetics
reaction kinetics
    The branch of physical chemistry that is
    concerned with understanding the rates of
    chemical reactions.
    
    It is to be contrasted with
    thermodynamics, which deals with the
    direction in which a process occurs but in
    itself tells nothing about its rate.
    
    Chemical kinetics includes investigations
    of how experimental conditions influence
    the speed of a chemical reaction and yield
    information about the reaction's mechanism
    and transition states, as well as the
    construction of mathematical models that
    also can describe the characteristics of a
    chemical reaction.

Glass
    A liquid or solid depending on the
    temperature -- a very viscous (but not
    sticky) one. That's not a myth, but the
    stained glass windows analogy is.

    An amorphous solid.

    At room temperature, glass molecules can't
    slide past each other, so it's a solid.

    There is structural change that causes
    glass to turn into a liquid at higher
    temperatures.

desiccation
    The removal of moisture from something.
    "long periods of drought have led to the
    desiccation of farming land"

desiccant
    A hygroscopic substance that is used to
    induce or sustain a state of dryness
    (desiccation) in its vicinity; it is the
    opposite of a humectant.
    
    Commonly encountered pre-packaged
    desiccants are solids that absorb water.

superconductor
    A substance that conducts electricity
    without resistance when it becomes colder
    than a "critical temperature."
    
    At this temperature, electrons can move
    freely through the material.
    
    Superconductors are different from
    ordinary conductors, even very good ones.

Aerogel
    A synthetic porous ultralight material
    derived from a gel, in which the liquid
    component for the gel has been replaced
    with a gas without significant collapse of
    the gel structure.
    
    The result is a solid with extremely low
    density and extremely low thermal
    conductivity.

inquart
inquartation
    Involves initially diluting the gold in
    the refinable material to about 25%
    (literally 'quartering' the gold) by
    melting with the appropriate addition of
    copper or silver, granulating the melt so
    as to generate a high surface area and
    then treating with nitric acid.

substrate
    Typically the chemical species being
    observed in a chemical reaction, which
    reacts with a reagent to generate a
    product.
    
    It can also refer to a surface on which
    other chemical reactions are performed, or
    play a supporting role in a variety of
    spectroscopic and microscopic techniques.

pH
power of hydrogen
potential of hydrogen
    A scale used to specify the acidity or
    basicity of an aqueous solution.
    
    Acidic solutions are measured to have
    lower pH values than basic or alkaline
    solutions.

atomization
    The process of converting an analyte in
    solid, liquid or solution form to a free
    gaseous atom.
    
    It is the transformation of a bulk liquid
    into a spray of liquid droplets in a
    surrounding gas or vacuum.


ionic compound
molecular compount
covalent compount
    Ionic compounds are made up of:
    - metals
    - nonmetals

    [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKA4CZwbZWU][Ionic vs. Molecular - YouTube]]


    Molecular/covalent compounds are made up
    only of:
    - nonmetals

    The nonmetals are on the far right and
    top- right corner of the periodic table.

    Except, hydrogen is the only exception
    outside of the nonmetal triangle which is
    also regarded as a nonmetal.

    Differences:

polyatomic ion
monoatomic ion
    A polyatomic ion is an ion consisting of
    more than one atom, and a monoatomic ion
    consists of only one atom.

    "-ate" has one more oxygen than "-ite".

    Nitrate NO₃⁻
    Nitrite NO₂⁻

    "-ide" usually is a monoatomic ion - not
    always though. Usually, it lacks oxygen,
    for the most part.

    Nitride N³⁻

    Sulfate SO₄²⁻
    Sulfite SO₃²⁻
    Sulfide S²⁻
