holography
    A technique that enables a wavefront to be
    recorded and later re-constructed.
    
    Holography is best known as a method of
    generating three-dimensional images, but
    it also has a wide range of other
    applications.
    
    In principle, it is possible to make a
    hologram for any type of wave.

    Made by superimposing a second wavefront
    (normally called the reference beam) on
    the wavefront of interest, thereby
    generating an interference pattern which
    is recorded on a physical medium.
    
    When only the second wavefront illuminates
    the interference pattern, it is diffracted
    to recreate the original wavefront.
    
    Holograms can also be computer-generated
    by modelling the two wavefronts and adding
    them together digitally.
    
    The resulting digital image is then
    printed onto a suitable mask or film and
    illuminated by a suitable source to
    reconstruct the wavefront of interest.
