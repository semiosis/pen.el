Geomatics
    Concerned with the application of
    computers to the traditional spatial
    techniques used in cartography and
    topography.
    
    Geomatics emerged from the quantitative
    revolution in geography in the mid-1950s.
    
    Today, geomatics methods include spatial
    analysis, geographic information systems
    (GIS), remote sensing, and global
    positioning systems (GPS).
    
    Geomatics has led to a revitalization of
    some geography departments, especially in
    Northern America where the subject had a
    declining status during the 1950s.
