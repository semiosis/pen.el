propositional logic vs first-order logic
    Propositional logic only deals with
    “facts”, statements that may or may not be
    true of the world, e.g. “It is raining”. ,
    one cannot have variables that stand for
    books or tables.

    In first-order logic, variables refer to
    things in the world and you can quantify
    over them.

    Propositional:

    - j:noisy-or-coin

    First-order:

    Multiple rules for the same head:

        % Rules:

        someAlarm :- alarm2.
           ^           ^

    As opposed to the regular and

        0.6::heads2.

        % Rules:

head/tail notation
[H|Tail]
    http://www.cs.trincoll.edu/~ram/cpsc352/notes/prolog/search.html

    Example:
        excess([I|R],Limit) :- \+pack(I), excess(R,Limit).

head
tail
    A Prolog rule has the form:
        Head :- Body.

    The notation of the head of a rule depends
    on the number of arguments:

        If the predicate has zero arguments,
        then the head consists only of the
        predicate name.

head
conclusion
    The head (or conclusion) of a rule
    adds more definition to a predicate's
    behaviour.

predicate
    A predicate is a bit like a pure boolean
    function.

    Several rules may be used to define the
    functionality of a predicate.

    Example:
        heads(C)

    Another example:
        heads

    A predicate is a bit like a pure boolean
    function.

    Several rules may be used to define the
    functionality of a predicate.

    A Prolog rule has the form:
        Head :- Body.

    Example:
        heads(C) :- coin(C), lands_heads(C).

    The predicate here is:
        heads(C)

    The predicate contains the predicate name
    'heads' and one argument, 'C'.

pattern matching
    https://homepage.cs.uri.edu/faculty/hamel/courses/2015/spring2015/csc481/lecture-notes/ln481-012.pdf

    Example:
        % excess/1
        excess(Limit) :- excess([skis,boots,helmet,gloves],Limit). % all possible items
        % excess/2
        excess([],Limit) :- Limit<0.
        excess([I|R],Limit) :- pack(I), weight(I,W), L is Limit-W, excess(R,L).
        excess([I|R],Limit) :- \+pack(I), excess(R,Limit).

intensional probabilistic fact
    Fact with a `flexible’ probability.

        weight(skis,6).
        weight(boots,4).
        weight(helmet,3).
        weight(gloves,2).

        % intensional probabilistic fact with flexible probability:
        P::pack(Item) :- weight(Item,Weight),  P is 1.0/Weight.

query
    Example:
        0.5::heads(C).
        two_heads :- heads(c1), heads(c2).
        query(two_heads).

    Queries can also be added in batch.

        0.5::heads(C).
        query(heads(C)) :- between(1, 4, C).

non-ground query
    It is also possible to give a non-ground
    query, on the condition that the program
    itself contains sufficient information to
    ground the probabilistic parts.

        0.5::heads(C) :- between(1, 4, C).
        query(heads(C)).

evidence
    Evidence specifies any observations on
    which we want to condition this
    probability. Evidence conditions a part of
    the program to be true or false.

    It can be specified using a fact
    evidence(Literal).

        0.5::heads(C).
        two_heads :- heads(c1), heads(c2).
        evidence(\+ two_heads).
        query(heads(c1)).

    This program computes the probability that
    the first coin toss produces heads when we
    know that the coin tosses did not both
    produce heads.
    
    You can try it out in the online editor.
    
    Evidence can also be specified using the
    binary predicate evidence(Positive, true)
    and evidence(Positive, false).

condition
    [verb]

    Problog introduces also two predicates
    query and evidence for querying a
    probabilistic program or to condition it
    to some pieces of evidence.

    "condition it to some pieces of evidence"

    A prolog rule is called a clause.

    conclusion | head
    premise    | body

rule
clause
:-
    Example:
        a :- x.

    A prolog clause may be either:
    - fact/unit clause
    - rule

    A prolog rule is called a clause.
    
    A clause has a head, a neck and a body:
        father(X,Y) :- parent(X,Y), male(X).
    
    The head is a rule's conclusion.
    
    The body is a rule's premise or condition.

neck
    A clause has a head, a neck and a body:
        father(X,Y) :- parent(X,Y), male(X).

probabilistic clause
    Example:
        0.5::a :- x.

    probabilistic clauses help to reduce
    auxiliary predicates.

    For example, to reduce the following:
        0.6::lands_heads(_).
        heads(C) :- coin(C), lands_heads(C).

    Do this:
        0.6::heads(C) :- coin(C).

    This just means you can put the
    functionality of a different predicate (in
    this case, the predicate 'lands_heads') into
    the rule/clause instead of calling a
    predicate to get the behaviour inside (in
    this case, the behaviour is the
    probability).

auxiliary
    providing supplementary or additional help
    and support.
    "auxiliary airport staff"

auxiliary atom
auxiliary predicate
    A predicate is a bit like a pure boolean
    function.

    Several rules may be used to define the
    functionality of a predicate.

    So an auxiliary predicate is simply a
    predicate which is used by the body of a
    rule to use/reuse the logic that that
    auxiliary predicate provides.

    For example, p_alarm1, p_alarm2 and
    p_alarm3 are auxiliary atoms used by the
    'alarm' predicate:

        0.9::p_alarm1.
        alarm :- burglary, earthquake, p_alarm1.

        0.8::p_alarm2.
        alarm :- burglary, \+earthquake, p_alarm2.

        0.1::p_alarm3.
        alarm :- \+burglary, earthquake, p_alarm3.

    Another example, lands_heads is an
    auxiliary predicate used by the 'heads'
    predicate:

    To reduce the following:
        0.6::lands_heads(_).
        heads(C) :- coin(C), lands_heads(C).

    Do this:
        0.6::heads(C) :- coin(C).

annotated disjunction
    Examples:
    - 0.5::a; 0.5::b.

    Can also be used as head of a clause.

    Examples:
    - 0.5::a; 0.5::b :- x.
    - 0.5::weather(0,sun); 0.5::weather(0,rain).
      0.8::weather(T,sun); 0.2::weather(T,rain) :- T > 0, T1 is T - 1, weather(T1, sun).
      0.4::weather(T,sun); 0.6::weather(T,rain) :- T > 0, T1 is T - 1, weather(T1, rain).

annotated disjunction
multi-valued variable
    I think the rule of sum is partially
    implemented as multi-valued variables.

    https://dtai.cs.kuleuven.be/problog/tutorial/basic/02_bayes.html#annotated-disjunctions-dealing-with-multi-valued-variables

    A probabilistic primitive that chooses
    exactly one of a number of alternatives
    (if their probabilities sum to 1.0, if the
    sum is less than 1.0, then with some
    probability none of the alternatives is
    picked).
    
    It expresses that at most one of these
    choices is true.
    
    There is always an implicit null choice
    which states that none of the options is
    taken.

    Example:
        1/6::die(D, 1); 1/6::die(D, 2); 1/6::die(D, 3);
        1/6::die(D, 4); 1/6::die(D, 5); 1/6::die(D, 6).
    
    In this example, however, that extra state
    has zero probability because the
    probabilities of the other states sum to
    one.

stochastic memoization
    [#probabilistic programming]

    Remembering probabilistic events that have
    already occurred.

    Example:
        $MYGIT/mullikine/problog-examples/stochastic-memoisation.problog

    Example2:
        $MYGIT/mullikine/problog-examples/stochastic-memoisation-zeros.problog

        The reason that most sequences have
        probability zero, is that if it
        encounters the same die a second time,
        it will not roll it again, but reuse
        the (memoized) result of the previous
        roll. 

Meta-predicates
    Apply a predicate on all members of a list
    (or higher-order functions) such as map,
    partition, fold, and scan.

not
not provable
\+
    Because of the problems of
    negation-as-failure, negation in Prolog is
    represented in modern Prolog interpreters
    using the symbol \+, which is supposed to
    be a mnemonic for not provable with the \
    standing for not and the + for provable.
