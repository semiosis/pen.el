ranking signal
ranking factor
    Characteristics of a website that
    determine the position in the search
    engines.
    
    All ranking signals combined form the
    algorithm of a search engine.
    
    How this algorithm works is a secret.
    
    Nobody knows exactly which factors decide
    the order of the search results.

popularity signal
    [ranking factor]
    
    The more unique queries we can gather for
    a page, the better our model for the page
    will be.
    
    Our use of Human Web also enables us to
    collect anonymous statistics on the page,
    a part of which is shown below.
    
    This structure shows the popularity of the
    page in different countries at this moment
    in time, which is used as a popularity
    signal.
    
    We can see that it is very popular in the
    UK, less so is Australia, etc.

page model
    We can use these query logs to build a
    model of the page outside of its content,
    which we refer to as page models.
