    Many symbols which we recognize today as
    contents of the unconscious were project
    onto matter, onto the prima materia.

    The alchemist sought the "secret of God"
    in the primary material and, in doing so,

    medical writers and philosophers of
    classical antiquity, particularly in
    regard to physiology, and is also used in
    Greek translations of ruach רוח in the
    Hebrew Bible, and in the Greek New
    Testament.

    to his inner world.
