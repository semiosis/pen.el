L
LSPACE
DLOGSPACE
    [computational complexity]

    The complexity class containing decision
    problems that can be solved by a
    deterministic Turing machine using a
    logarithmic amount of writable memory
    space.
    
    Formally, the Turing machine has two
    tapes, one of which encodes the input and
    can only be read, whereas the other tape
    has logarithmic size but can be read as
    well as written.
    
    Logarithmic space is sufficient to hold a
    constant number of pointers into the input
    and a logarithmic number of boolean flags,
    and many basic logspace algorithms use the
    memory in this way.

PL
Probabilistic L
    The class of languages recognizable by a
    polynomial time logarithmic space
    randomized machine with probability > 1/2
    (this is called unbounded error).
    
    Equivalently, as shown below, PL is the
    class of languages recognized by unbounded
    time unbounded error logspace randomized
    machine.

    An example of PL complete problem (under
    logspace reduction) is finding whether the
    determinant of a matrix (with integral
    coefficients) is positive.

    Given a matrix M and a number n, testing
    with {\displaystyle |M|>n}{\displaystyle
    |M|>n}[note 1] is also PL complete. By
    contrast, testing whether matrix permanent
    is positive is PP complete.

    PLPL=PL in the sense that for every f in
    PL, PL is unchanged if it is extended to
    allow {\displaystyle x\to
    f(A,x)}{\displaystyle x\to f(A,x)} as a
    subroutine, where A is the input string.

    PL contains NL and BPL and is contained in
    NC2.
