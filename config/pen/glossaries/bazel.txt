rule
    Much of Bazelâ€™s strength comes from the
    ability to define new rules which can be
    used by others.
    
    There is a growing and evolving set of
    rules to support popular languages and
    packages.

    Here is a selection of recommended rules:
    - Android
    - Boost
    - C / C++
    - Docker
    - Go
    - Haskell
    - Java
    - JavaScript / NodeJS
    - Kubernetes
    - Maven dependency management
    - Objective C
    - Package building and fetching rules
    - Protocol Buffers
    - Python
    - Scala
    - Shell
