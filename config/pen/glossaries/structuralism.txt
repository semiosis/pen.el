structural linguistics
structuralism
    [#linguistics]

    The theoretical position that finds
    meaning in the relation between things,
    rather than in things in isolation.
    
    In other words, it gives primacy to
    pattern over substance.
    
    Example:
        To take a crude example, the colors
        red, green, and amber take on the
        meanings “stop,” “go,” and “caution”
        in relation to each other, in the
        context of a traffic light.
    
        In some other context, and in
        opposition to other colors, red may
        mean something completely different,
        such as socialism or communism, or
        humanity or sacrifice.
    
    Such meanings may be either part of a
    universal pattern or culturally
    determined.

    Denotes schools or theories in which
    language is conceived as a self-contained,
    self-regulating semiotic system whose
    elements are defined by their relationship
    to other elements within the system.
