Chinese whispers
    An internationally popular children's
    game.

    It is also called transmission chain
    experiments in the context of cultural
    evolution research, and is primarily used
    to identify the type of information that
    is more easily passed on from one person
    to another.

Russian scandal
    There is a game occasionally played in
    society which eminently illustrates the
    value of testimony transmitted with the
    most perfect good faith through a
    succession of truthful persons.

    It is called Russian Scandal, and is thus
    played:

    - One of the party writes a short simple
      tale, perhaps a single anecdote.

    - The original composer of the tale, whom
      we will call A, retires into another
      room with B, to whom he communicates it.

    - A then returns to the party, and sends
      in C, who is told by B the tale he had
      just learnt.

    - B then returns to the party and sends in
      D, who is informed of the anecdote by C,
      and so on until the story has been
      transmitted through twelve educated and
      truthful witnesses.

    The twelfth then relates to the whole
    party the story he has just heard: after
    that the original written document is
    read.

    The wit or fun of the transmitted story is
    invariably gone, and nothing but an
    unmeaning platitude generally remains.

    One very interesting case occurred a few
    years ago in which the wit of the original
    story had evidently been lost, but had
    afterwards been revived in a different
    form in the latter part of its
    transmission.
