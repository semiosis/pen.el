        'to talk quietly'
        (bas = an adjective)

        Je lui rends visite DE TEMPS EN TEMPS
        'I visit her from time to time'
        (de temps en temps = a prepositional
        phrase)

        Elle travaille LE MATIN
        'She works in the mornings'
        (le matin...oun phrase).

affirmative sentence

            le coffre? Je L'AI OUVERT 'The car
            boot? I've opened it': La porte?
            Je L'ai OUVERTE 'The door? I've
            opened it'; and so on.

article
    definite article = le, la, les

    indefinite article = un, une, des

    The 'partitive' article - du, de la, des -
    indicates that a noun refers to something
    which is part of a larger mass:

    CES ÉLECTIONS
    'If the conditions are right, the party
    will win this election'
    [two clauses]

    Verb which is marked for tense and
    agreement, as opposed to non-finite forms
    like the infinitive, imperative,
    participles:
        e.g.
            Je PARLE
            'I'm speaking';

            J'AI PARLÉ
            'T spoke'

            Je SAIS parler franais
            'T can speak French'.

formal French
    In this grammar 'formal French' refers to
    a style used by speakers of standard
    educated French when they are paying
    particular attention to the form of what
    they are saying or writing.

    It is a style usually appropriate when
    someone is speaking in an official
    capacity (lectures, sermons, speeches,
    etc.), or writing in learned, academic or
    literary style.

    Features of formal French which are absent
    from informal French include:
    - the use of the simple past tense:
      Il SORTIT
      'He went out'
    - the use of the past anterior tense:
      Aussitôt qu'il FUT SORTI ...
      'As soon as he had gone out...'
    - retention of ne in ne... pas.

gender
    A division of nouns into two classes:
    - masculine, and
    - feminine.

    The distinction shows up mainly in
    determiners (le versus la, ce versus
    cette, mon versus ma, etc.), in pronouns
    (il versus elle) and in the agreement of
    adjectives with nouns (beau versus belle).

    Gender distinctions are grammatical and
    need not correspond to sex distinctions in
    the real world (although they mostly do):
        e.g.
            médecin
            'doctor' is masculine, but
            can refer to men or women

            personne
            'person' is feminine but can refer
            to men or women.

gerund
    See participle.

imperative
    A form of the verb used to give orders,
    express encouragement or give advice:

        ALLEZ!
        'Come on!'

        FAIS attention^.
        'Watch out!'

impersonal
    Refers to a pronoun (usually a subject
    pronoun) which does not refer to any

    IL est temps de partir
    'It's time to leave'

    ÇA me fait peur d'y aller la nuit
    'It scares me to go there at night'

    subjunctive, imperative, infinitive or
    participial.

    'to finish'

    VENDRE
    'to sell'

    RECEVOIR
    'to receive'

informal French
    In this grammar 'informal French' refers
    to a style used by speakers of standard
    educated French in contexts of relaxed,
    spontaneous communication when they are
    interacting with friends, colleagues,
    family, etc.

    Features of informal French
    include:
    - the non-use of the simple past or past
      anterior tenses, and
    - the regular omission of ne from ne ...
      pas.

        UN oiseau,
        UN oiseau QUI CHANTE

        parle,
        IL parle,
        IL parle LENTEMENT

        grand,
        si grand,
        ELLE EST SI grande.

    friend', UNE BIRE BIEN FROIDE 'a really
    cold beer', CHACUN DE MES AMIS LES PLUS
    CHERS 'each of my dearest friends'.

number
    A grammatical distinction between nouns or
    pronouns which are singular and those
    which are plural. Number distinctions need
    not correspond to real singular
    and plural distinctions in the world, and
    can differ between English and French
    (although mostly the grammatical and real-
    world distinctions coincide):

    e.g.
        'hair' (singular)
            versus
        'cheveux' (plural)

        'trousers' (plural)

        Il l'a pris
        'He took it'

    An indirect object is the noun
    phrase or pronoun affected indirectly by
    the action described by the verb.

        Il a envoyé un cadeau À SA MÈRE
        'He sent a present to his mother'.

    An object of a preposition is any
    noun phrase which follows a preposition,
    including indirect objects introduced by
    à:

    e.g.
        dans LE HALL
        'in the hall',

        à côté DU RESTAURANT
        'beside the restaurant',

        à SA MÈRE
        'to his mother'.

    deuxime (2e), troisime (3e), etc.

parenthetical expression

    reservation he/she has about what is being
    said.

    It is the equivalent of putting something
    in brackets ('parentheses'):

    e.g.
        Pierre, SEMBLE-T-IL, a gagné le prix
        'Pierre, it seems, won the prize'

    Parentheticals are kinds of adverbial.

    which occur with avoir or être:

    e.g.
        J'ai MANGÉ
        'I've eaten'

        Elle est PARTIE
        'She has left'

    Present participles end in -ant and
    correspond to English verbs ending in
    '-ing':

    e.g.
        disparaissant
        'disappearing'

        attendant
        'waiting'

    Gerunds are present participles
    preceded by en:

    - en disparaissant
      'while disappearing; by disappearing'
    - en attendant
      'while waiting; by waiting'.

passive

    the direct object becomes the subject and
    the verb is turned into an être + past
    participle construction:

    e.g.
        Il a réparé le vélo
        'He repaired the bike'

        LE VÉLO A ÉTÉ PÉPARÉ

person
    The three categories into which noun
    phrases or pronouns can be divided
    depending on whether they refer to the
    person(s) speaking (je, me, moi, nous -
    first person), the person(s) being spoken
    to (tu, te, toi, vous - second
    person), or the person(s) or thing(s)
    being talked about (il, elle, lui, ils,
    etc. - third person). Pronouns take
    different forms in the first, second and
    third person, and finite verbs change
    their form to agree with the person of the
    subject (e.g. je parle, nous parlons, vous
    parlez, etc.).

personal pronoun
    A first person, second person or third
    person pronoun which stands for a noun
    phrase mentioned or implied elsewhere in a
    text or discourse.

    Personal pronouns contrast with impersonal
    pronouns which do not refer to other noun
    phrases.

    Personal pronouns are pronouns like je,
    me, moi, nous; tu, te, toi, vous; il,
    elle, lui, les etc. They take their name
    from the fact that they can be classified
    as first, second or third person, and do
    not necessarily refer to people; e.g. elle
    is a personal pronoun, but it refers to
    the inanimate émission in:

        ELLE est intéressante, cette émission
        'That pro gramme's interesting'.

phrase
    Any string of words which gives rise to an
    expression with a cohesive meaning:

    e.g.
        MON ONCLE JACQUES
        'my uncle Jacques'
        (noun phrase); Pierre MARCHE LENTEMENT 'Pierre
        walks slowly' (verb phrase), etc.

possessive
    possessive determiner:
    - mon,
    - ma,
    - ton,
    - votre, etc.

    - la mienne,
    - le tien,
    - le vôtre, etc.

preposition
    Words like à, de, dans, en, sur, etc.,
    which are followed by noun
    phrases and indicate the direction, location,
    orientation, etc., of an entity.

prepositional phrase
    A phrase consisting of a preposition and
    its complement.

    The following are all
    prepositional phrases:
        À MIDI
        'at noon'

        À CHAQUE VIRAGE
        'at every bend'

        AU CHEVET DE MA MÈRE
        'at my mother's bedside'

    phrase when that phrase is already known
    from the context:

    e.g.
        je, tu, nous, le, la, leur, etc.

    Pronouns have different forms depending on
    whether they are subjects, direct objects,
    indirect objects or objects of a
    preposition.

proper noun
    Names like Marie-Paule, le Canada, are
    proper nouns.

quantifier
    A determiner-like expression which
    measures or quantifies a noun or noun
    phrase:

    e.g.
        BEAUCOUP D'argent
        'a lot of money'

        LA PLUPART DES spectateurs
        'most of the spectators'

        TOUS les jours
        'every day'

question (direct versus indirect)
    A direct question is addressed directly to
    the hearer or reader:

    e.g.
        VIENS-TU?
        'Are you coming?'

    An indirect question reports the
    asking of a question:

    e.g.
        Il a demandé si TU VENAIS
        'He asked if you were coming'

reciprocal
    A type of sentence where either the direct
    object, the indirect object or the object
    of a preposition refers to the same
    person, thing, idea, etc., as a plural
    subject, and the sentence is intepreted so
    that the subjects are doing things to each
    other: e.g. Les boxeurs SE sont blesss
    'The boxers injured each other'; Les
    participants SE sont pos des questions
    'The participants asked each other
    questions'; Les manifestants ont lutt LES
    UNS CONTRE LES AUTRES 'The demonstrators
    fought with each other'.

reflexive
    A type of sentence where either the direct
    object, the indirect object or the object
    of a preposition refers to the same
    person, thing, idea, etc., as the subject:
    e.g. Je ME lave T am washing (myself)';
    Elle SE cache la vrit 'She hides the truth
    from herself; Elle parle CONTRE ELLE-MME
    'She is speaking against herself.

relative clause
    A clause which modifies a noun phrase or a
    pronoun: e.g. // y avait deux hommes QUI
    SORTAIENT DU BAR 'There were two men who
    were coming out of the bar'; C'est lui QUI
    ME L'A DONN 'He is the one who gave it to
    me'.

subject
    The noun phrase or pronoun in a clause
    about which the verb and its complement
    say something. Subjects usually appear in
    front of the verb: e.g. LE DNER est servi
    'Dinner is served'; SA FEMME parle
    lentement 'His wife speaks slowly';
    DELPHINE...attue 'Delphine was beaten'. It
    can appear after the verb in some
    constructions. See subject-verb inversion.

subject-verb inversion
    Subjects normally precede finite verbs in
    French. But in questions, and after
    certain adverbs, the subject and the
    finite verb may change places: e.g.
    AIME-T-IL LE Roquefort? 'Does he like
    Roquefort cheese?; A peine S'EST-IL ASSIS
    qu'on lui a demand de se dplacer 'Hardly
    had he sat down when someone asked him to
    move'.

subjunctive
    See Chapter 11 for discussion.

subordinate clause
    A clause which is part of a larger
    sentence, and whose meaning is secondary
    to that of the main clause: e.g. PARCE
    QU'IL EST RICHE, Pierre est heureux
    'Because he is rich, Pierre is happy' -
    parce qu'il est riche is subordinate to
    Pierre est heureux; Jean a compltement
    rnov le grenier DEPUIS QU'IL EST CHEZ NOUS
    'Jean has completely renovated the loft
    since he has been at our house' - depuis
    qu'il est chez nous is subordinate to jean
    a compltement rnov le grenier.

superlative
    A way of modifying adjectives and adverbs
    to single out an entity as the best or the
    worst of its kind: e.g. C'est la route LA
    PLUS DANGEREUSE/LA MOINS DANGEREUSE de la
    rgion 'It's the most dangerous road/least
    dangerous road in the region'; Cette
    voiture-l est LA PLUS VITE/LA MOINS VITE
    'That car is the fastest/the least fast'.

tense
    A form of the verb which indicates the
    time at which an event took place relative
    to other events being talked about: e.g.
    Je PRENDS [present tense] la route par o
    nous SOMMES VENUS [compound past tense]
    'I'm taking the road along which we came'.
    Tenses have names like present, future,
    sim(cid:173) ple past, compound past, etc.
    - see Chapter 7 for the forms of verbs in
    dif(cid:173) ferent tenses, and Chapter 10
    for their uses.

transitive verb
    A verb which has a direct object: e.g.
    Elle mange UNE POMME 'She is eating an
    apple'. In this grammar we also

    verbs, which have direct objects, from
    indirectly transitive verbs which have
    prepositional complements: e.g. Il parle
    DE SES PARENTS 'He is talking of his
    parents', and from ditransitive verbs
    which have complements consist(cid:173)
    ing of a direct object and a prepositional
    object: e.g. J'ai envoy LA LETTRE MON FRRE
    T sent the letter to my brother'.

verb
    A class of words which refers to actions,
    states, events, accomplishments, and so
    on, and has different forms to indicate
    tense and agreement: e.g. Elle PARLE 'She
    is speaking'; L'eau SCINTILLAIT 'The water
    was sparkling'.

verb phrase
    The phrase consisting of a verb alone, or
    a verb and the elements which modify it
    (but excluding the subject). Each of the
    following is a verb phrase: marchait 'was
    walking'; marchait lentement 'was walking
    slowly'; a envoy un cadeau d'anniversaire
    sa tante 'sent a birthday present to his
    aunt'.fyq
