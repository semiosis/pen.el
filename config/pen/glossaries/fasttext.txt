FastText
    A library for text classification and
    representation.
    
    It transforms text into continuous vectors
    that can later be used on any language
    related task.
    
    A few tutorials are available.

    Uses a hashtable for either word or
    character ngrams.
    
    The size of the hashtable directly impacts
    the size of a model.
    
    f
    with the option '-hash'.
    
    For example a good value is 20000.
    
    Another option that greatly impacts the
    size of a model is the size of the vectors
    (-dim).
    
    This dimension can be reduced to save
    space but this can significantly impact
    performance.
    
    If that still produce a model that is too
    big, one can further reduce the size of a
    trained model with the quantization
    option.
