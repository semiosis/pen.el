run
lein run
    Executes the -main function of the
    targeted or default namespace. Lein runs
    through out the full execution of that
    main methods so if your main function
    creates a web servers, then the leiningen
    process also stays up the whole time.

trampoline
lein trampoline
    Executes the -main function as a separate
    process, so that the main leiningen
    process can exit and therefore you only
    have one process running

uberjar
lein uberjar
    Creates a standalone jar file, so that any
    other user does not need to have lein
    installed to run your code. (or any of the
    source files). To run the jar, you execute
    java -jar myjarname.jar which contains all
    the source and all the dependencies.
