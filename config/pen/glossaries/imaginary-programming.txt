reality
    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reality

    The sum or aggregate of all that is real
    or existent within a system, as opposed to
    that which is only imaginary.
    
    The term is also used to refer to the
    ontological status of things, indicating
    their existence.
    
    In physical terms, reality is the totality
    of a system, known and unknown.

fact
    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fact

    A fact is an occurrence in the real world.
    
    The usual test for a statement of fact is
    verifiability—that is whether it can be
    demonstrated to correspond to experience.
    
    Standard reference works are often used to
    check facts.
    
    Scientific facts are verified by
    repeatable careful observation or
    measurement by experiments or other means.

object of the mind
    An object that exists in the imagination,
    but which, in the real world, can only be
    represented or modeled.
    
    Some such objects are abstractions,
    literary concepts, or fictional scenarios.

figment
    A thing that someone believes to be real
    but that exists only in their imagination.
    "it really was Ross and not a figment of
    her overheated imagination"

sense
    [#linguistics]

    A way in which an expression or a
    situation can be interpreted; a meaning.
    "it is not clear which sense of the word
    ‘characters’ is intended in this passage"

    [#mathematics]

    A property (e.g. direction of motion)
    distinguishing a pair of objects,
    quantities, effects, etc. which differ
    only in that each is the reverse of the
    other.

    "the cord does not become straight, but
    forms a length of helix in the opposite
    sense"

truth sense
sense
    [#imaginary computing]

    What constitutes as untrue when using a
    language model as a basis for truth?

    That depends on sense of the model for
    this particular task.

    The sense is the truth orientation, in a
    similar way to the way the word sense is
    used in the definition of a vector.

    See:
    - sense (mathematics)
    - sense (linguistics)

    [#star wars]

    Truth sense was an ability that was
    cultivated by the Jedi Order, which
    allowed the individual to tap into the
    Force in order to determine if another
    being was telling the truth.

imaginary reflection
    This is where a program such as a complex
    interpreter can access knowledge of its
    holographic representation via a language
    model.

internal imaginary reflection
    This is reflection but where the program
    consults a LM for information on its own
    source.

external imaginary reflection
    This is reflection but where the program
    consults a LM for information on the way
    the program is used in the real world.

holographic representation
    The embedding of the way software is used
    within a language model that has been
    trained on the usage of that software,
    whether it is usage of the final program
    or usage of its internal source code
    within itself.

    THe holographic representation of software
    encompasses the way a program's source
    code is used both within itself and also
    in the real world as modelled by a
    language model.

complex interpreter
    This is a real/ordinary interpreter with
    an interactivity layer that solicits a
    language model for imaginary reflection
    capabilities to the real program.

chimeric
chimerism
    NLG: Program that is not in any way
    written in a language known to the
    programmer
    
    chimerism is exhibited in other parts of
    GPT generations. For example, generated
    URLs. Generated URLs are usually not
    correct due to chimerism. It would be
    interesting to generate imaginary websites
    using chimeric URLs.

evaluator
    Not every interpreter is an evaluator.

imaginarily
    [#english]

    Having existence only in the imagination;
    unreal.

complex terminal
holographic terminal
    A holographic terminal has a layer of
    interactivity that queries a language
    model, given the current state of the
    terminal.

    A complex terminal is slightly more
    general definition, where there may not be
    a clear boundary between the hologram
    interactivity layer. Complex implies that
    base operations may be part imaginary and
    part real.

complex
complex programming
    Complex programming is where real
    instructions (completely independent of
    language models) are intermixed with
    imaginary (ones that are based on LM
    output).

    The word complex is suitable because it
    describes this braiding along with the
    mathematical connotations of complex
    numbers.

    It's just a programming style that
    combines both real programming with
    imaginary programming.

imaginary programming
IP
    A programming paradigm in which a computer
    program's behaviour exists in relativity to
    language models.

    To make an analogy, imaginary programming
    is a type of programming, where much like
    pure-functional, the code who's behaviour
    depends on the output of a language model,
    either pending or precomputed, stands
    apart from the part that has no such
    association.

    What is deemed 'imaginary' is code that
    uses or is waiting on output from a
    language model and its behaviour is so
    altered by it.

    What is deemed 'ordinary' is code which is
    not 'imaginary'.

    A distinction is made between grounded and
    non-grounded imaginary programming.
    'Non-grounded imaginary programming' may
    also be called 'pure imaginary
    programming'.

grounded

non-grounded
pure imaginary programming
tethered
    If a function has a language model as a
    parameter affecting its behaviour and
    besides from that has no other imaginary
    inputs then it is considered 'grounded'.

    If a function has a language model as a
    parameter affecting its behaviour and
    contains other imaginary inputs then it is
    considered 'tethered'.

    If an imaginary function relies on the
    output of functions that have in the past
    used a language model as a parameter, but
    does not contain a reference to specific
    language model used then it is considered
    'non-grounded' or 'pure imaginary'.

    A function can be both tethered and pure
    imaginary.

    Pure imaginary code is still code in a
    similar way to how pure functional code is
    considered code and may be used to create
    useful datastructures and algorithms.

ordinary programming
    Programming with functions that do not
    have an imaginary dimension (they do not
    take a language model as a parameter and
    the result of ordinary code is not
    polluted by a language model).

holographic programming
    [type of imaginary programming]

    This is like imaginary programming but
    where the language models are trained on
    software.

    Holographic code, therefore, may employ
    associations made between elements of the
    original code, how that code is used and
    how it is described, to build
    applications.

    Holographic programming lets you use the
    latent space of a language model as a kind
    of hyperspace to enable things like:
    - bridge the usage of an application with
      the application's code
    - imaginary reflection
    - inference in place of computation

literate programming
    NLG: A programming paradigm that
    emphasizes the importance of the reading
    and writing of code over the importance of
    the design of the code.

imaginary multiplexing
    When spawning a chatbot which is named,
    for example, "All of the Mad Hatter's Tea
    Party crew", the chatbot may have multiple
    personalities.

    In some sense, a group of chatbots has
    been spawned, yet they chatter out of a
    single, 'real' chatbot.

    This isn't real multiplexing, but it could
    be considered an example of imaginary
    multiplexing.

intention
expectation
    These are purely imaginary.

utility
utility of a pure imaginary function
    For the conscious observer, it is the
    intention behind invoking the command and
    the expectation of what it does are both
    subjective.

thought prompt
thought-prompt
    A thought prompt is probably a multimodal
    prompt (like a phantasmagoria) which
    represents something like:
    - A memory
    - A dream
    - An idea

    A thought prompt is probably transmodal.

transmodal
transmodal style
    'Transmodal' could be ascribed to a prompt
    and in doing so would indicate that the
    prompt transcends one or more modes.

    The prompt might then be a thought prompt.
