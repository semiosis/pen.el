Fast fashion
    A contemporary term used by fashion
    retailers to express that designs move
    from catwalk quickly to capture current
    fashion trends.
    
    A second, critical definition adds that
    fast fashion is not only about quickly
    moving from runway to store to consumer,
    but also to the garbage.
