hyperreal
hyperreality
    [#semiotics]
    [#postmodernism]

    An inability of consciousness to
    distinguish reality from a simulation of
    reality, especially in technologically
    advanced postmodern societies.

    Proposed by Jean Baudrillard.

    This is more prominent in technologically
    advanced societies.

    Hyperreality is a state where reality and
    fiction are blended together.
    
    For Baudrillard, the world no longer has a
    chance of escape into an upper realm of
    Truth, God, the Law, or the Idea, but
    merely the lower reaches of immanence.

Simulacres et Simulation
simulacra and simulation
    News may be a simulation.
    The reaction is the simulacra.

simulation
    Characterized by a blending of 'reality'
    and representation, where there is no
    clear indication of where the former stops
    and the latter begins.
    
    Simulation is no longer that of a
    territory, a referential being, or a
    substance; "It is the generation by models
    of a real without origin or reality: a
    hyperreal." Baudrillard suggests that
    simulation no longer takes place in a
    physical realm; it takes place within a
    space not categorized by physical limits
    i.e., within ourselves, technological
    simulations, etc.

simulacra
simulacrum
    The simulacrum is often defined as a copy
    with no original, or as Gilles Deleuze
    (1990) describes it, "the simulacrum is an
    image without resemblance".
    
    Baudrillard argues that a simulacrum is
    not a copy of the real, but becomes truth
    in its own right.
    
    He created four steps of reproduction:

    1. basic reflection of reality,

    2. perversion of reality;

    3. pretense of reality (where there is no
       model); and

    4. simulacrum, which "bears no relation to
       any reality whatsoever".

    The reaction from the simulation.

    An image or representation of someone or
    something.
    "a small-scale simulacrum of a skyscraper"

    An unsatisfactory imitation or substitute.
    "a bland simulacrum of American soul
    music"

    A simulation of a simulation.
