Bonjour
    Hello, Good day.

    This phrase is a little formal.

    You can use it with friends, but they
    might wonder why you're being so proper.

Bonsoir
    Good evening.

Ravi(e) de faire votre connaissance.
    Happy to make your acquaintance.

    This is a formal expression you can use
    when you're meeting someone for the first
    time.

    Notice the letter e in parentheses here?

    You'll want to add it in writing if you're
    a lady.

    (You won't hear the difference when it's
    spoken.)

Enchanté(e).
    Charmed.

    This one's short and sweet, and much more
    informal than the previous expression.

    The same note about the extra e applies
    here.

Comment allez-vous ? / Comment ça va ?
    How are you?

    (formal / informal) Both of these
    basically mean, "How's it going?" but the
    first option is much more formal.

    Use "Comment ça va ?" with your friends
    and peer groups.

Je vais bien, merci.
    I'm doing well, thanks.

Comment vous appelez-vous ? / Comment t'appelles-tu ?
    What's your name?

    (formal / informal) The informal version
    uses tu for "you," instead of vous.

    This also means that the verb will be
    conjugated differently.

Je m'appelle...
    I am called... / My name is...

D'où venez-vous ? / D'où viens-tu ?
    Where are you from? (formal / informal)

 Asking for Help

J'ai besoin d'aide.
    I need help.

Pourriez-vous m'aider ? / Pourrais-tu m'aider ?
    Could you help me? (formal / informal)

Je me sens mal.
    I don't feel well.

J'ai besoin d'un médecin.
    I need a doctor.

Au secours !
    Help! (urgent)

Je ne comprends pas.
    I don't understand.

Je ne parle pas beaucoup le français.
    I don't speak a lot of French.

Je ne parle qu'un peu français.
    I only speak a little French.

Comment on appelle ça ?
    What is that called?
    
    Just point at what you want, and ask this
    to find out its French name.
    
    Voilà ! (There you go!)

Comment dire _____ en français ?
    How do I say _____ in French?
    
    If you're working with someone who speaks
    English, or another language you know
    well, you can ask them directly for a
    translation of a word you don't know in
    French.

Plus lentement, s'il vous plaît. / Plus lentement, s'il te plaît.
    Slower, please.
    
    (formal / informal)

Où se trouve la banque ?
    Where is the bank?
    
    The important part of this phrase is où se
    trouve (where is).
    
    Just add the name of whatever you're
    looking for after that.
    
    For instance, you can end the sentence
    with le musée (the museum), l'hôtel (the
    hotel) or la gare (the train station).

Pourriez-vous l'écrire ? / Pourrais-tu l'écrire ?
    Could you write it down?
    
    (formal / informal) Especially when you're
    just learning French, it can be difficult
    to understand what you're hearing.
    
    Asking someone to write down the
    information you need can be an enormous
    help!

Je cherche des chaussures.
    I'm looking for shoes.

    Je cherche (I'm looking for) is the
    essential part of this phrase.  Once you
    have that down, you can ask for anything
    you can name.

    For example, if you're shopping for
    clothes, you can replace des chaussures
    with any other article of clothing that
    you're looking for, like:
    - un manteau (a coat),
    - une robe (a dress),
    - un pantalon (a pair of pants),
    - etc.

Je ne connais pas ma taille.
    I don't know my size.

Combien ça coûte ?
    How much does that cost?

Puis-je payer avec une carte de crédit ?
    May I pay with a credit card?

Puis-je avoir un sac ?
    May I have a bag?

J'aimerais voir le menu.
    I would like to see the menu.

Est-ce qu'il y a des plats végétariens ?
    Are there vegetarian dishes?
    
    You can substitute in other preferences,
    such as sans gluten (gluten free), after
    plats (dishes).

Je voudrais de la soupe.
    I would like to have soup.
    
    Simply remember je voudrais (I would like)
    and just plug in anything you want off the
    menu after this phrase! For example, you
    can ask for du pain (the bread), un steak
    (a steak), une tarte (pie) and so on.
    
    You can also say, je vais prendre...
    
    or je prendrai...
    
    (I'll take...) in place of je voudrais (I
    would like).

L'addition, s'il vous plaît.
    The bill, please.
    
    If you happen to be at a restaurant in
    Québec, where French is a little different
    than in Europe, you'll want to ask for la
    facture instead of l'addition.

Merci bien.
    Thanks a lot.

De rien.
    You're welcome.
    
    It's nothing.

Comment va le travail ?
    How's work going?
    
    You can substitute le boulot for le
    travail to make this more casual.

Tu veux prendre un verre ?
    Do you want to get a drink?
    
    (informal)

Comment va votre famille ? / Comment va ta famille ?
    How's your family?
    
    (formal / informal)

Passe-moi un coup de fil plus tard.
    Give me a call later.
    
    (informal)

Tu peux me donner ton numéro ?
    Can you give me your number?
    
    (informal)

J'aimerais te revoir.
    I'd like to see you again.
    
    (informal) Natural French Expressions how
    to become fluent in french

"Ça roule ?" "Comme d'hab !"
    "How's it going?" "Same as always!" This
    is a very colloquial statement, meaning
    that everything's great and life's going
    well.
    
    Therefore, in the form of a question, it
    simply means "How's life?  Good?"

    It's used in a similar way as Ça va?
    
    The response to this question is merely an
    abbreviation of the phrase comme
    d'habitude, meaning "as usual." A common
    expression, comme d'hab can be used in
    place of the standard comme d'habitude in
    virtually any informal setting.

N'importe quoi !
    Whatever! For all those who tend to have a
    dissenting opinion, this casual French
    phrase is a must.
    
    It simply means "whatever," and is
    commonly used in French when someone is
    exasperated and wishes to openly display
    their disagreement in a simple, informal
    way.
    
    For example: "Je te jure ! Je n'ai rien
    fait ! (I swear, I didn't do anything!)
    -N'importe quoi...
    
    (Whatever...) Similarly, in some other
    contexts, n'importe quoi can mean
    "anything," like in this example: J'aurais
    donné tout et n'importe quoi ! (I would
    have given anything and everything!)

C'est n'importe quoi !
    That's nonsense! This informal French
    phrase is similar to n'importe quoi.
    
    However, there's a slight nuance in the
    meaning of this particular expression.
    
    It still portrays the idea of
    exasperation, but it means "That's
    nonsense!" For example: Le président a
    bien fait d'augmenter les impôts.
    
    (The president was right to increase
    taxes.) -C'est n'importe quoi ! (That's
    nonsense!)

Laisse tomber...
    Just forget it! / Never mind! This phrase
    literally means "drop it," but doesn't
    have quite the same snappy tone behind it
    as "just drop it!" does in English.
    
    For example: Et alors?
    
    Est-ce que tu as eu ton augmentation de
    salaire ?
    
    (So?  Did you get your raise?)
    - Laisse tomber...
    
    L'entreprise a fait faillite !

    (Forget it... The company went bankrupt!)

Ça vous dit ? / Ça te dit ?
    Are you up for it?
    
    (formal / informal) This casual French
    expression is great for suggesting outings
    with friends or restaurant choices.
    
    It can also mean "Sound good?" So,
    whenever you get a marvelous idea for a
    Saturday afternoon or evening, tack this
    on at the end as a way of politely asking
    your friends if they're interested.
    
    Use the first version (with vous) when
    addressing several friends, and the latter
    (Ça te dit ?) when hanging out with just
    one friend.
    
    For example: Il y a un petit resto chinois
    pas loin de chez moi...
    
    ça te dit ?
    
    (There's a little Chinese restaurant not
    far from my place...sound good?)

Tiens-moi au courant !
    Keep me up to date! This is the perfect
    French phrase to use as you're waiting to
    see how things play out in a friend's
    life.
    
    Perhaps they just started a new job, or
    moved to a new city, and you want to know
    how things are evolving.
    
    End your emails or conversations with this
    little phrase to ensure they give you all
    their latest updates.
    
    The response to this phrase would be
    "Ouais, t'inquiète pas, je te tiens au
    courant." (Yeah, don't worry, I'll keep
    you up to date).

Allez savoir pourquoi ! / Va savoir pourquoi !
    Your guess is as good as mine! (formal /
    informal) This is a useful little French
    phrase that perfectly expresses one's
    befuddled state of mind.
    
    Notice that it can be used for both the
    formal and informal version of the word
    "you," the first being formal or speaking
    to several people, and the latter informal
    and to one person.
    
    For example: Elle a donné sa démission, et
    ne répond plus à mes textos ! Va savoir
    pourquoi ! (She quit her job, and isn't
    responding to my texts anymore! God knows
    why!)

Bref
    In short / To make a long story short Bref
    is only ever used to summarize something
    or to give one's final impression of
    something after a lengthy story's been
    told.
    
    It's an easy little word to recall, due to
    the fact that the English equivalent is
    almost the same: in brief.
    
    Other synonyms would be "all in all" or
    "in short." For example: Elle m'a appelé
    hier et m'a dit qu'elle n'avait pas les
    mêmes sentiments pour moi, et qu'au final,
    elle veut qu'on reste amis.
    
    Bref, elle m'a largué.
    
    (She called me yesterday and told me that
    she didn't have the same feelings for me,
    and that in the end, she wants to remain
    friends.
    
    In short, she dumped me.)

T'sais ?
    Ya know?
    
    This casual French phrase is used so
    commonly in casual settings that it's
    almost impossible to have a conversation
    with friends without hearing it.
    
    It simply means "Ya know?" and is
    oftentimes tacked onto the end of a
    sentence to emphasize whatever the speaker
    is saying.
    
    For example: Non, mais j'en ai marre,
    t'sais?
    
    (No, but I am sick of it, ya know?)

Ouais, enfin...
    Yeah, well...
    
    Like English, French has its share of
    filler words, and enfin is commonly used
    as such.
    
    Meaning "well," it's slightly more refined
    than "eeuuuh" (uhhhh).
    
    Like most filler words, it doesn't
    necessarily change the meaning of the
    sentence.
    
    Here's an example: Ouais, enfin...
    
    faut vivre avec! (Yeah, well...gotta live
    with it!)

Allez !
    Oh, c'mon! This interjection is the best
    way to communicate impatience with
    someone.
    
    Trying to get out the door but your friend
    is holding you up, dillydallying with
    their phone?
    
    Let out a little, exasperated allez ! to
    get your point across.
    
    Note that this is technically the vous
    (you [formal/plural] conjugation of the
    verb aller (to go).
    
    However, it can also mean, "Let's go!" So,
    when you're getting restless, you can just
    say, "Allez !" It's also common to hear
    this word in the bleachers of a sports
    event: Allez, allez ! (C'mon! Let's go!)

C'est naze / c'est nul / c'est pourri !
    That stinks! These are all lovely little
    French phrases to use to say "that sucks!"
    or "that's stupid!" or "that's terrible!"
    The general implication is that whatever
    is being discussed is either a total bore
    or totally ridiculous.
    
    For example: Ça, c'est marrant! Par
    contre, ce cours est nul ! (Now that's
    funny! This class, however, sucks!)

J'ai le cafard...
    I'm feeling a little down...
    
    This is an informal way of expressing your
    sadness.
    
    It literally means, "I have the
    cockroach," but to use the verb phrase
    avoir le cafard simply means to be
    depressed or to feel down.
    
    You can also say Ça me donne le cafard,
    which means "that depresses me."

Ça te changera les idées...
    It'll take your mind off things...
    
    Use this French phrase when consoling a
    friend who's down.
    
    Offer to go with them to a movie or to a
    café to grab a cappuccino.
    
    Make your proposition, then use this
    argument to get them out of their funk.
    
    For example: Allez ! Tu ne peux pas rester
    enfermé dans ta chambre ! Viens avec moi
    au ciné! Ça te changera les idées !
    (C'mon! You can't stay cooped up in your
    room! Come with me to the movie theater!
    That'll take your mind off things!)

Revenons à nos moutons !
    Let's get back to the point! This is a
    perfect little expression to use after the
    conversation has strayed from the original
    topic, and literally means "let's get back
    to our sheep!" It actually means "Let's
    get back to the subject at hand!" or
    "Let's get back to the point!" This little
    gem actually derives from French
    literature, from a tale called la Farce du
    Maître Pathelin, written by François
    Rabelais in the 16th century.
    
    Obviously, this little phrase was catchy
    enough to stick, because it's still used
    today.
    
    Next time your friend starts rambling
    about something entirely unrelated, toss
    out this little phrase, and wow them with
    your excellent knowledge of both French
    vernacular and literature!

Je n'en crois pas mes yeux !
    I can't believe my eyes! Let this one
    loose when you're pleasantly surprised or
    dumbfounded by something you are
    witnessing.
    
    The translation is more or less literal on
    this expression, and you can do no wrong
    in using it when dazzled or surprised!

Tu t'en sors ?
    Are you managing okay?
    
    This is a common French phrase to use
    while observing a friend who appears to be
    having difficulty doing something.
    
    It's the equivalent of asking "Doing okay
    there?
    
    You managing there?" For example: Tu t'en
    sors ?
    
    (You managing there?) Pas trop, non.
    
    Je ne sais pas comment faire un créneau...
    
    (No, not really.
    
    I don't know how to parallel park...)

J'en mettrais ma main au feu !
    I'd bet my life on it! The French version
    of this expression is a bit more colorful
    than the English, literally meaning "I'd
    put my hand in the fire!" It simply
    expresses that you're certain of
    something-and it's usually used to try to
    convince others that you are right.
    
    Believe it or not, this little phrase
    originates from the Middle Ages!

Il ne faut pas mettre tout dans le même sac !
    You can't just group it all into the same
    category! This is your go-to casual French
    expression for when one of your friends is
    generalizing, and it literally means, "you
    can't put everything in the same bag!" If
    you find yourself with a friend who does
    like to lump everything together, then
    remind him or her of this with this simple
    phrase.

Tu fais quoi ?
    What are you up to?
    
    The phrase "Whatcha doin'?" might be the
    best way to portray the laid-back style of
    this French phrase.
    
    Without knowing that it's informal, it can
    look like a strange sentence, literally
    meaning "You're doing what?" Yet it
    commonly replaces "Qu'est-ce que tu fais?"
    or "Que fais-tu?" in day-to-day
    situations.
    
    This phrase is highly informal, and not
    recommended that you use it with anyone
    other than family or close friends.

Au revoir
    Goodbye (somewhat formal)

Salut
    Goodbye (informal)

Ciao
    Goodbye (informal) As in a lot of European
    countries, France has borrowed the Italian
    word ciao to say a casual goodbye.

À demain
    See you tomorrow

Bonne journée
    Have a nice day

Bonne soirée
    Have a good evening

À ce soir
    See you tonight

À tout à l'heure / À plus tard
    See you later

À bientôt
    See you soo

À la prochaine
    Until next time The longer version of this
    expression is, à la prochaine fois, with
    fois meaning "time."

Adieu
    Goodbye (forever)

    This essentially means, "until we meet our
    maker."

    So please, unless you're singing a certain
    song from "The Sound of Music," refrain
    from using this unless you know you'll
    never be seeing that person again!
