computability theory
recursion theory
    A branch of mathematical logic, of
    computer science, and of the theory of
    computation that originated in the 1930s
    with the study of computable functions and
    Turing degrees.
    
    The field has since expanded to include
    the study of generalized computability and
    definability.
    
    In these areas, recursion theory overlaps
    with proof theory and effective
    descriptive set theory.

    Basic questions addressed by recursion
    theory include:
    - What does it mean for a function on the
      natural numbers to be computable?
    
    - How can noncomputable functions be
      classified into a hierarchy based on
      their level of noncomputability?
    
    Although there is considerable overlap in
    terms of knowledge and methods,
    mathematical recursion theorists study the
    theory of relative computability,
    reducibility notions, and degree
    structures; those in the computer science
    field focus on the theory of subrecursive
    hierarchies, formal methods, and formal
    languages.

    With just three initial functions:
    - successor,
    - constant, and
    - projection,
    closed under composition and primitive
    recursion, one can produce most computable
    functions studied in number theory
    (addition, division, factorial,
    exponential, etc.).
