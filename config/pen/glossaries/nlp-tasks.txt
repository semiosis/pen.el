Paraphrase mining
    The task of finding pharaphrases (texts
    with identical / similar meaning) in a
    large corpus of sentences.
    
    In Semantic Textual Similarity we saw a
    simplified version of finding paraphrases
    in a list of sentences.
    
    The approach presented there used a brute-
    force approach to score and rank all
    pairs.
