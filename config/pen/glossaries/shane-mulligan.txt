    Say, Sigmund Freud's Id was a little bit
    damaged - and he embraced it rather than
    allowed God to change it, thus propagating
    the error into the Ego and Super-ego,
    which reinforced the Id. He used the ego
    to bring the Id into conscious reality.

    Jung dissolved the Ego by integrating the
    shadow.

    Repairwork begins with repairing the Id.
