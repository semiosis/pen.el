mitmproxy
man-in-the-middle proxy
    A console tool that allows interactive
    examination and modification of HTTP
    traffic.
    
    It differs from mitmdump in that all flows
    are kept in memory, which means that it´s
    intended for taking and manipulating
    smallish samples.

Filter expressions
    Many commands in the mitmproxy tool make use of filter expressions. Filter
    expressions consist of the following operators:        
    
    ~a  Match asset in response: CSS, Javascript, Flash, images.  
    ~b regex  Body  
    ~bq regex  Request body  
    ~bs regex  Response body  
    ~c int  HTTP response code  
    ~d regex  Domain  
    ~dst regex  Match destination address  
    ~e  Match error  
    ~h regex  Header  
    ~hq regex  Request header  
    ~hs regex  Response header  
    ~http  Match HTTP flows  
    ~m regex  Method  
    ~marked  Match marked flows  
    ~q  Match request with no response  
    ~s  Match response  
    ~src regex  Match source address  
    ~t regex  Content-type header  
    ~tcp  Match TCP flows  
    ~tq regex  Request Content-Type header  
    ~ts regex  Response Content-Type header  
    ~u regex  URL  
    ~websocket  Match WebSocket flows (and HTTP-WebSocket handshake flows)  
    !  unary not  
    &  and  
    |  or  
    (...)  grouping  
    
    - Regexes are Python-style
    - Regexes can be specified as quoted strings
    - Header matching (~h, ~hq, ~hs) is against a string of the form “name: value”.
    - Strings with no operators are matched against the request URL.
    - The default binary operator is &.

mitmdump
    The command-line companion to mitmproxy.
    
    It provides tcpdump-like functionality to
    let you view, record, and programmatically
    transform HTTP traffic.
    
    See the --help flag output for complete
    documentation.
