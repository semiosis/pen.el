Holocron
    Holocrons were information-storage devices
    used by both the Jedi Order and the Sith
    that contained ancient lessons or valuable
    information in holographic form.
    
    They appeared as palm-sized, glowing
    polyhedrons of crystalline material and
    hardware, and could only be activated and
    used through the power of the Force.
