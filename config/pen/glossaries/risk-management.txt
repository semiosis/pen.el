Failure Modes & Effects Analysis
FMEA
    Risk management tool that identifies and
    quantifies the influence of potential
    failures in a process. FMEA analyzes
    potential failures using three criteria:
    1   Occurrence (failure cause and frequency)
    2   Severity (impact of the failure)
    3   Detection (likelihood of failure detection)

    Once assessed, prioritized failures are
    addressed with mistake-proofing for
    preventable failures and contingency plans
    for unpreventable risks.
