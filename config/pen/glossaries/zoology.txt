anabiosis
cryptobiosis
    A temporary state of suspended animation
    or greatly reduced metabolism.

    A metabolic state of life entered by an
    organism in response to adverse
    environmental conditions such as
    desiccation, freezing, and oxygen
    deficiency.
    
    In the cryptobiotic state, all measurable
    metabolic processes stop, preventing
    reproduction, development, and repair.
