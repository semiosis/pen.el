General Data Protection Regulation
GDPR
    A legal framework that sets guidelines for
    the collection and processing of personal
    information from individuals who live in
    the European Union (EU).

    E.g.
        Anonymous - Don’t store any personal
        data, unless given with permission
        (eg. email for newsletter).
        
        Don’t store IP addresses or
        superfluous session data that could be
        used for fingerprinting.
        
        This way, my site is GDPR compliant by
        default.
        
        And while not a hard requirement, I
        don’t use cookies to track visitors
        across multiple sessions.
