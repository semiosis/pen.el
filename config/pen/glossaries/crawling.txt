polite
    Crawler needs to be polite (some form of
    domain level rate-limiting.

fame
famous
    A significant portion of the web is cut
    off from you if your crawler is not
    famous.

    Google has a huge competitive advantage in
    this regard, a lot of site owners allow
    just GoogleBot (and maybe BingBot), making
    it an extremely tedious process for an
    unknown crawler to get whitelisted on
    these sites.

attention
    Handle sites where we are not whitelisted
    on a case-by-case basis knowing that
    getting the attention of the sites is not
    guaranteed.
