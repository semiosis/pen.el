Photogrammetry
    The art and science of extracting 3D
    information from photographs.
    
    The process involves taking overlapping
    photographs of an object, structure, or
    space, and converting them into 2D or 3D
    digital models.
    
    Photogrammetry is often used by surveyors,
    architects, engineers, and contractors to
    create topographic maps, meshes, point
    clouds, or drawings based on the real-
    world.

Aerial photogrammetry
    The rocess of utilizing aircrafts to
    produce aerial photography that can be
    turned into a 3D model or mapped
    digitally.
    
    Now, it is possible to do the same work
    with a drone.

Terrestrial photogrammetry
    When images are captured using a handheld
    camera or with a camera mounted to a
    tripod.
    
    The output of this method is not to create
    topographic maps, but rather to make 3D
    models of a smaller object.
