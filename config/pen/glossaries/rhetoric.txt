polemic
    Contentious rhetoric intended to support a
    specific position by forthright claims and
    to undermine the opposing position.
    
    Polemics are thus seen in arguments on
    controversial topics.
    
    The practice of such argumentation is
    called polemics.

apophasis
    A rhetorical device wherein the speaker or
    writer brings up a subject by either
    denying it, or denying that it should be

    Accordingly, it can be seen as a
    rhetorical relative of irony.

    especially a formal simile, as in poetry
    or poetic prose, taken from a present or
    imagined object or event: distinguished
