daydream
daydreaming
    The stream of consciousness that detaches
    from current, external tasks when
    attention drifts to a more personal and
    internal direction.
    
    This phenomenon is common in people's
    daily life shown by a large-scale study in
    which participants spend 47% of their
    waking time on average on daydreaming.

mythopoeic
    Relating to the making of myths; causing,
    producing, or giving rise to myths.

mythopoeic imagination
    [#Jungian psychology]

    The intermediary between consciousness and
    the unconscious (both personal unconscious
    and collective unconscious).

passive fantasy
    Active imagination is different from
    ordinary, passive fantasy.
    
    This is daydreaming: it is sitting and
    merely watching the stream of fantasy that
    goes on in the back of your mind as though
    you were at a movie.
    
    You do not consciously participate and
    thus it is a waste of energy, because the
    issues do not get resolved.
    
    The “I” must enter into the imaginative
    act as intensely as it would if it were an
    external, physical experience.

imemory
imemories
    Imaginary memories.

intellection
    The action or process of understanding, as
    opposed to imagination.
    "audiences demand intellection without the
    need for thought"

Maladaptive Daydreaming
MD
    Describes a condition where a person
    regularly experiences daydreams that are
    intense and highly distracting - so
    distracting, in fact, that the person may
    stop engaging with the task or people in
    front of them.

    Usually occurs as a coping mechanism in
    response to trauma, abuse or loneliness.

    Sufferers create a complex inner world
    which they escape to in times of distress
    by daydreaming for hours.

Fantasy prone personality
FPP
    A disposition or personality trait in
    which a person experiences a lifelong
    extensive and deep involvement in fantasy.

    This disposition is an attempt, at least
    in part, to better describe "overactive
    imagination" or "living in a dream world".

    An individual with this trait (termed a
    fantasizer) may have difficulty
    differentiating between fantasy and
    reality and may experience hallucinations,
    as well as self-suggested psychosomatic
    symptoms.

    Closely related psychological constructs
    include daydreaming, absorption and
    eidetic memory.
