Cyc
    A long-term artificial intelligence
    project that aims to assemble a
    comprehensive ontology and KB that spans
    the basic concepts and rules about how the
    world works.
    
    Hoping to capture common sense knowledge,
    Cyc focuses on implicit knowledge that
    other AI platforms may take for granted.
