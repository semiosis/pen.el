actor model
    Removes the need for lock-based
    synchronization

    A mathematical model of concurrent
    computation that treats actor as the
    universal primitive of concurrent
    computation.
    
    In response to a message it receives, an
    actor can: make local decisions, create
    more actors, send more messages, and
    determine how to respond to the next
    message received.
    
    Actors may modify their own private state,
    but can only affect each other indirectly
    through messaging (removing the need for
    lock-based synchronization).
    
    The actor model originated in 1973.
    
    It has been used both as a framework for a
    theoretical understanding of computation
    and as the theoretical basis for several
    practical implementations of concurrent
    systems.
    
    The relationship of the model to other
    work is discussed in actor model and
    process calculi.
