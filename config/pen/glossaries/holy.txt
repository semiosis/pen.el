Yahweh
YHWH
    The name of the state god of the ancient
    Kingdom of Israel and, later, the Kingdom
    of Judah.
    
    Adonai.
    
    His name is composed of four Hebrew
    consonants (YHWH, known as the
    Tetragrammaton) which the prophet Moses is
    said to have revealed to his people
    The Hebrew word for the self-revealed name
    of the God of the Old Testament.
    
    It comes from the Hebrew verb "To be."

    At its core, "Yahweh" means "To be."

    The English Bible translates it as "LORD,"
    which distinguishes it from "Lord" (which
    is translated as "master").

    -To be
    - He Who Makes That Which Has Been Made
    - He Brings into Existence Whatever Exists

Adonai
    Lord.
