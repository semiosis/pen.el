broadcast
multicast
    Broadcast and multicast are two types of
    transmission.
    
    The main difference between broadcast and
    multicast is that, in broadcast, the
    message or packets go to all the connected
    devices on the network while in multicast,
    the packets go to a required set of
    devices on the network.

adjacent host
    A host on the same subnet.

IP protocol number
    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_IP_protocol_numbers

    Examples:
    - 1    ICMP
    - 6    TCP
    - 17   UDP
    - 89   OSPF
    - 115  L2TP

Open Shortest Path First
OSPF
    [Protocol of the internet]

    A routing protocol for Internet Protocol
    networks.
    
    It uses a link state routing algorithm and
    falls into the group of interior gateway
    protocols, operating within a single
    autonomous system.
    
    It is defined as OSPF Version 2 in RFC
    2328 for IPv4.

PING
Packet INternet Groper

arpwatch
    A computer software tool for monitoring
    Address Resolution Protocol traffic on a
    computer network.
    
    It generates a log of observed pairing of
    IP addresses with MAC addresses along with
    a timestamp when the pairing appeared on
    the network.

bmon
    A monitoring and debugging tool to capture
    networking related statistics and prepare
    them visually in a human friendly way.
    
    It features various output methods
    including an interactive curses user
    interface and a programmable text output
    for scripting.

dhclient
    Provides a means for configuring one or
    more network interfaces using the Dynamic
    Host Configuration Protocol, BOOTP proto‐
    col, or if these protocols fail, by
    statically assigning an address.

RRP
Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol
    [networking protocol]

    Provides for automatic assignment of
    available IP routers to participating
    hosts.
    
    This increases the availability and
    reliability of routing paths via automatic
    default gateway selections on an IP
    subnetwork.

Linux Virtual Server
IPVS

Layer 2
data link layer
    [#OSI]

    Node-to-node data transfer—a link between
    two directly connected nodes. 

    MAC addresses.

Layer 3
network layer
    [#OSI]

    Provides the capacity to transfer packets
    from one host to another, potentially in
    different networks.

    IP addresses.

Layer 4
transport layer
    [#OSI]

    Maintains QoS for transfer.
    Routes traffic.

Layer 5
session layer
    [#OSI]

    Controls the dialogues (connections)
    between computers.

    Establishes, manages and terminates the
    connections between the local and remote
    application. 

keepalived
    Routing software written in C.
    
    The main goal of this project is to
    provide simple and robust facilities for
    loadbalancing and high-availability to
    Linux system and Linux based
    infrastructures.
    
    Loadbalancing framework relies on well-
    known and widely used IPVS kernel module
    providing Layer4 loadbalancing.
    
    Keepalived implements a set of checkers to
    dynamically and adaptively maintain and
    manage loadbalanced server pool according
    their health.
    
    On the other hand high-availability is
    achieved by VRRP protocol.
    
    VRRP is a fundamental brick for router
    failover.
    
    In addition, Keepalived implements a set
    of hooks to the VRRP finite state machine
    providing low-level and high-speed
    protocol interactions.
    
    In order to offer fastest network failure
    detection, Keepalived implements BFD
    protocol.
    
    VRRP state transition can take into
    account BFD hint to drive fast state
    transition.
    
    Keepalived frameworks can be used
    independently or all together to provide
    resilient infrastructures.

IP-aliases
    An obsolete way to manage multiple IP-
    addresses/masks per interface.
    
    Newer tools such as iproute2 support
    multiple address/prefixes per interface,
    but aliases are still supported for
    backwards compatibility.
