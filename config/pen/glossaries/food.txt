Norwegian breakfast
    Doesn't look anything like a traditional
    American breakfast.
    
    Breakfast is a light affair often
    involving Norwegian rye bread cheese, jam
    and butter.
    
    There's also often meat and fish, like
    salami, ham, smoked salmon or pickled
    herring.
    
    Muesli is also common.
    
    And coffee is a must.
