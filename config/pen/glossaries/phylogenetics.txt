phylogenetics
    The study of the evolutionary history and
    relationships among individuals or groups
    of organisms (e.g. species, or
    populations).
    
    These relationships are discovered through
    phylogenetic inference methods that
    evaluate observed heritable traits, such
    as DNA sequences or morphology under a
    model of evolution of these traits.
    
    The result of these analyses is a
    phylogeny (also known as a phylogenetic
    tree)â€”a diagrammatic hypothesis about the
    history of the evolutionary relationships
    of a group of organisms.

phylogenetic tree
    A diagram that represents evolutionary
    relationships among organisms.
    
    Phylogenetic trees are hypotheses, not
    definitive facts.
    
    The pattern of branching in a phylogenetic
    tree reflects how species or other groups
    evolved from a series of common ancestors.
