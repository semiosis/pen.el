eudaimonia
    A Greek word literally translating to the
    state or condition of 'good spirit', and
    which is commonly translated as
    'happiness' or 'welfare'.
    
    In works of Aristotle, eudaimonia was the
    term for the highest human good in older
    Greek tradition.

    The highest human good, the only human
    good that is desirable for its own sake
    (as an end in itself) rather than for the
    sake of something else (as a means toward
    some other end).
