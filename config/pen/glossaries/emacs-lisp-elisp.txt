lexical scoping
dynamic scoping
    Lexical scoping refers to when the
    location of a function's definition
    determines which variables you have access
    to.
    
    On the other hand, dynamic scoping uses
    the location of the function's invocation
    to determine which variables are available

subseq
    ewwlinks +/"subseq" "http://newartisans.com/2016/01/pattern-matching-with-pcase/"

    (equal (subseq value 0 3) '(1 2 (4 .5)))

user-error
    This is like error except that a user
    error (or "pilot error") comes from an
    incorrect manipulation by the user, not
    from an actual problem.

eieio
EIEIO
Enhanced Implementation of Emacs Interpreted Objects
    Provides an Object Oriented layer for
    Emacs Lisp, following the basic concepts
    of the Common Lisp Object System (CLOS).
    
    It provides a framework for writing
    object-oriented applications in Emacs.

memoize
    memoize is a Lisp closure in ‘../manual-packages/emacs-memoize/memoize.el’.
    
    (memoize FUNC &optional TIMEOUT)
    
    Memoize FUNC: a closure, lambda, or symbol.

    (memoize 'my-function)
    (memoize-restore 'my-function)

s-join
  (s-join "|" (--map-indexed (todo it (eq it-index index)) entries)))

search-forward-regexp
    (search-forward-regexp "argument")

    If I do C-c C-h C-k C-s, I can see that
    the interactive function is
    ~isearch-forward-regexp~ and the
    non-interactive function is
    ~search-forward-regexp~

pop-to-buffer vs display-buffer
    vim +/";; Don't call pop-to-buffer. Use display-buffer instead because it doesn't select" "$MYGIT/config/emacs/config/my-anaconda.el"

closure
    A function that also carries a record of
    the lexical environment that existed when
    the function was defined.
    
    When it is invoked, any lexical variable
    references within its definition use the
    retained lexical environment.

-map-indexed
    (-map-indexed FN LIST)

    Like map, but provides the index (as well
    as the element) to the lambda.

    Return a new list consisting of the result
    of (FN index item) for each item in LIST.

    In the anaphoric form --map-indexed, the
    index is exposed as symbol it-index.

window-scroll-functions
    Window scroll hook.

defvar-local
    Interestingly, defvar-local does not come
    into effect until run, but I guess defset-
    local would, because it has a set.

posframe
    Posframe only works in GUI mode.

pcase
    http://newartisans.com/2016/01/pattern-matching-with-pcase/

    (pcase value 
      (`(1 2 (4 . 5) ,(pred stringp)) 
        (message "It matched!")))

    pred is a form belonging to pcase.
    It allows you to make an assertion of the
    value in that place.

pcase-let

      (message "value1 is a list of (1 2 %s); value2 ends with %s" 
               foo bar))
