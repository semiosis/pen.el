    programming language that's used for
    creating applications and games for the

Scheme Requests for Implementation
SRFI
    An effort to coordinate libraries and
    extensions of standard Scheme programming
    language, necessitated by Scheme's
    minimalist design, and particularly the
    lack of a standard library before Scheme
    R6RS.
    
    SRFI is supported by many Scheme
    implementations.
    
    As such, it is an informal standard.
