Yggdrasil
    [#Norse cosmology]

    An immense and central sacred tree.
    
    Around it exists all else, including the
    Nine Worlds.
    
    Yggdrasil is attested in the Poetic Edda
    compiled in the 13th century from earlier
    traditional sources, and in the Prose Edda
    written in the 13th century by Snorri
    Sturluson.

semiotic function
    [#human development]
    [human ability]

    The semiotic function is the ability to
    create representations.

    Thanks to the semiotic function, we’ve
    been able to communicate in such a way
    that we created a culture that facilitated
    the survival and advancement of our
    species.
    
    It’s based on the use of signs and symbols
    that have distinct signifieds and
    signifiers.
    
    But how does it actually work? A great
    example of the semiotic function that can
    help you understand it better is a
    painting by the famous French painter,
    Magritte.
    
    He painted a pipe and wrote the words
    “Ceci n’est pas une pipe” (this is not a
    pipe) below it.
    
    He wanted to make it clear that although
    the painting certainly evoked a pipe, it
    wasn’t actually a pipe.
    
    It is, in this case, a symbolic
    representation of a pipe.
    
    In this example, Magritte used the
    semiotic function to make art.
    
    However, human beings use symbolic
    representations every day.

object
    [semiosis protocol]

    The object is the generation that the user
    desires, in their mind.

promptee
    The Pen.el peer address.

signifier
    [#semiosis protocol]
    [sign]

    An sNFT together with filled parameters.

    Hard-coded parameters:
    - prompt function name
      - public
    - promptee
      - may be private (default)
        - i.e. a Pen.el server url
      - may be public
        - i.e. OpenAI API endpoint
    
    User request / semiotic function
    parameters:
    - prompt function name and arguments
      (combined into a single parameter)

semiotic function
sNFT
Semiotic NFT
    [#semiosis protocol]

    A semiotic function is an abstraction over
    a prompt function.

    It happens between two interlocutors.

    It is a sign which may be used to signify
    what you want (the object).

    The return value is the generation or
    interpretant; A sign from the opposing

    interlocutor that refers to the 

    signified

    It's a simplified prompt function which
    only contains the parameters:
    - signifier
    - function name
    - function argaments arguments

    And what is returned is the:
    - generation (interpretant)

Perlocutionary Protocol
PP

Semiosis Protocol
SP
    You pay for semiosis.

    A cryptocurrency for prompting stewardship
    that rewards intelligibility, deglobalises
    and slows the growth of large language
    models by reusing outputs, and protects
    local truth by anonymising inputs.

    By slowing the growth of large LMs and
    protecting input data to prompt functions,
    local communities and individuals are
    protected from coercion and from SAAS
    vendor lock-in.

    Communities are free to use their own
    languages, whilst still being able to
    communicate via the protocol and thus put
    a price on illocutionary force in either
    direction. Thus people may be fairly
    persuaded instead of through force, and
    also may have illocutionary influence but
    at a price they are willing to pay. It
    puts market forces to work to more fairly
    distribute language power.

AGI
    Centralized language power.

Semiotic NFT
sNFT
snft
࿋
    [iNFT]
    [functor]

    It's a functor because it's meant to be
    called as a function, but has particular
    side-effects.

    Contains
    - sign function
    - price function
    - reward function
    - example/demo of utility?

gas
    Earn it by:
    - hosting/caching payload media.
    - hosting/caching output media.

sign function
s(࿋)
    Parameters:
    - prompt
      - Soft prompts will not be rewarded
        easily because they are
        unintelligible and people will
        naturally distrust them.
    - payloads
      - A list of payload (URL source, hash)
        2-tuples
        - SP must expend gas to obtain these
          payloads. A prompt may fail if the
          function does not have sufficient
          funds to make the transaction,
          including what has been allocated
          for obtaining payloads.
    - vendor
    - p(࿋)
    - id (worldcoin?)
      - needed for the price function to
        regulate users depending on their
        type or role, perhaps.

price function
p(࿋)
    Parameters:
    - base price
    - id (worldcoin?)

    The base may scale with the user type.
    - For example,
      - Maybe best to be less expensive for
        humans to run.
      - Maybe best to be more expensive for
        AIs to run.
      - In some cases, AI is better suited to
        run particular prompts.
        - For example, sensitive statistics.
    - Anyway, a user may be more or less
      entitled to run a type of prompt.
      - But everyone can see this function in
        the iNFT and can decide if it's a good
        idea, and to promote it / incorporate
        it.

reward function
r(࿋)
    Who gets paid (in percentages) when this
    sNFT is run.

    A list of (%, wallet / uid)
     
    Donate to:
    - Use ID iNFTs to identify people by name.
    - charities, for example.

uid
identity NFTs
    Example,
    - worldcoin
