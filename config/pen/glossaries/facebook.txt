FXL
Feature eXtraction Language
    DEPRECATED.

    Used before 2015. Scrapped.

    Used in combatting spam on the social
    networking service. FXL described as a
    narrowly-optimized implementation of a
    well-chosen subset of Standard ML (with
    some customized syntax). FXL offers two
    key advantages: it is simple and easy to
    write, yet extremely efficient for
    Facebook-sized workloads.

    The things to detect became more numerous
    and harder.

    The interpreter wasn't sophisticated
    enough.
