Sgraffito
    A technique either of wall decor, produced
    by applying layers of plaster tinted in
    contrasting colours to a moistened
    surface, or in pottery, by applying to an
    unfired ceramic body two successive layers
    of contrasting slip or glaze, and then in
    either case scratching so as to reveal
    parts of the underlying layer.
    
    The Italian past participle "sgraffiato"
    is also used, especially of pottery.
