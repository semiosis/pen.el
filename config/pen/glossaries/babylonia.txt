The Code of Hammurabi
    A well-preserved Babylonian code of law of
    ancient Mesopotamia, dated back to about
    1754 BC (Middle Chronology).

    One of the oldest deciphered writings of
    significant length in the world.

    Consists of 282 laws, with scaled
    punishments, adjusting "an eye for an eye,
    a tooth for a tooth" (lex talionis) as
    graded based on social stratification
    depending on social status and gender, of
    slave versus free, man versus woman.
