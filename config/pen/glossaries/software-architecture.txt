    Hard to achieve with OO languages.
    Easy with FP languages.

MAS
self-organized system
Multi-agent system
    A computerized system composed of multiple
    interacting intelligent agents.
    
    Multi-agent systems can solve problems
    that are difficult or impossible for an

Service-oriented architecture
SOA
    A style of software design where services
    are provided to the other components by
    application components, through a
    communication protocol over a network.
    
    A SOA service is a discrete unit of
    functionality that can be accessed
    remotely and acted upon and updated
    independently, such as retrieving a credit
    card statement online.
    
    SOA is also intended to be independent of
    vendors, products and technologies.

microservices
microservice architecture
    An architectural style that structures an
    application as a collection of services
    that are.
    
    Highly maintainable and testable.
    
    Loosely coupled.
    
    Independently deployable.
    
    Organized around business capabilities.

    An evolution of the service-oriented
    architecture pattern that elegantly
    eliminate organizational friction, giving
    your engineers and teams the autonomy they
    need to continuously ship, iterate, and
    improve.

    There are toolkits for building
    microservices in a single language.

    E.g.
    - Go:
