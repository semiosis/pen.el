spurs
    If you’re referring to spurs (see image),
    then they are used to help control the
    horse.

    Without spurs, the rider would use the
    heel of the boot, which the horse is less
    likely to respond to than a metal spike.

    When used correctly, spurs don’t cause
    much pain, (they are used fairly lightly)
    - however they can be used too
    aggressively, or can be too sharp, which
    many riders consider cruel.
