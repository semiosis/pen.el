belaying
    Exert tension on a climbing rope so that a
    falling climber does not fall very far.

    Partner applies tension at the other end
    of the rope whenever the climber is not
    moving, and removes the tension from the
    rope whenever the climber needs more rope
    to continue climbing.

    A critical part of the climbing system.

belay
    The place where the belayer is anchored;
    this is typically a ledge, but may be a
    hanging belay, where the belayer
    themselves is suspended from protection in
    the rock.

belayer
    Wears a harness that has a belay device
    attached.

    The rope threads through the belay device.
    
    By altering the position of the end of the
    rope, the belayer can vary the amount of
    tension on the rope.

on belay
    The person climbing is said to be "on
    belay" when one of these belaying methods
    is used.
    
    The belayer cat hold the entire weight of
    the climber with relatively little force,
    and easily arrest even a long fall.
    
    By using a mixture of belaying angle and
    hand-grip on the rope, the belayer can
    gently lower a climber to a safe point
    where climbing can be resumed.

dynamic rope
    Has some stretch in it.
    
    Often used for belaying so that the
    climber is not brought to a sudden jarring
    stop.
    
static ropes
    Non-stretching rope.

    Some climbers choose static ropes for
    abseiling/rapelling because it's easier to
    use.
