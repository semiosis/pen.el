tenet
    A principle or belief, especially one of
    the main principles of a religion or
    philosophy.
    "the tenets of a democratic society"

potentiality
actuality
    [#philosophy]

    Potentiality and actuality are a pair of
    closely connected principles which
    Aristotle used to analyze motion,
    causality, ethics, and physiology in his
    Physics, Metaphysics, Nicomachean Ethics,
    and De Anima.

potentiality
dynamis
    By contrast, potentiality (dynamis in
    Greek) is not a mode in which a thing
    exists, but rather the power to effect
    change, the capacity of a think to make
    transitions into different states.
    
    Later, in the philosophy of Husserl,
    actuality means existence in space and
    time, as opposed to possibility.

solipsistic
    A theory holding that the self can know
    nothing but its own modifications and that
    the self is the only existent thing also :
    extreme egocentrism.

    Only one's mind is sure to exist.

    As an epistemological position, solipsism
    holds that knowledge of anything outside
    one's own mind is unsure; the external
    world and other minds cannot be known and
    might not exist outside the mind.

hypostasis
    [#Philosophy and religion]

    The underlying state or underlying
    substance and is the fundamental reality
    that supports all else.
    
    In Neoplatonism the hypostasis of the
    soul, the intellect and "the one" was
    addressed by Plotinus.

monad
    (from Greek monas “unit”)

    An elementary individual substance that
    reflects the order of the world and from
    which material properties are derived.
    
    The term was first used by the
    Pythagoreans as the name of the beginning
    number of a series, from which all
    following numbers derived.
    
    Giordano Bruno in De monade, numero et
    figura liber (1591; “On the Monad, Number,
    and Figure”) described three fundamental
    types: God, souls, and atoms.
    
    The idea of monads was popularized by
    Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz in Monadologia
    (1714).
    
    In Leibniz’s system of metaphysics, monads
    are basic substances that make up the
    universe but lack spatial extension and
    hence are immaterial.
    
    Each monad is a unique, indestructible,
    dynamic, soullike entity whose properties
    are a function of its perceptions and
    appetites.
    
    Monads have no true causal relation with
    other monads, but all are perfectly
    synchronized with each other by God in a
    preestablished harmony.
    
    The objects of the material world are
    simply appearances of collections of
    monads.

committal philosophical theories
    A distinctiive theory.

committal
    Having clear or distinctive character.

noncommittal
    Giving no clear indication of attitude or
    feeling.

    - "A noncommittal reply."
    - "He was noncommittal about how the money
      would be spent."

    Having no clear or distinctive character.

teleology
    The explanation of phenomena in terms of
    the purpose they serve rather than of the
    cause by which they arise.

realism
    The attitude or practice of accepting a
    situation as it is and being prepared to
    deal with it accordingly.

individualism
    The habit or principle of being
    independent and self-reliant.

rhizome
    [philosophical concept]

    A concept in post-structuralism describing
    a nonlinear network that "connects any
    point to any other point".
    
    It appears in the work of French theorists
    Deleuze and Guattari, who used the term in
    their book A Thousand Plateaus to refer to
    networks that establish "connections
    between semiotic chains, organizations of
    power, and circumstances relative to the
    arts, sciences and social struggles" with
    no apparent order or coherency.
    
    A rhizome is purely a network of
    multiplicities that are not arborescent
    (e.g. the idea of hypertext in literary
    theory) with properties similar to
    lattices.
    
    Deleuze referred to it as extending from
    his concept of an "image of thought" that
    he had previously discussed in Difference
    and Repetition.

    Developed by Gilles Deleuze and Félix
    Guattari in their Capitalism and
    Schizophrenia (1972–1980) project.

    It is what Deleuze calls an "image of
    thought", based on the botanical rhizome,
    that apprehends multiplicities.

post-structuralism
post-structural
    A term for philosophical and literary
    forms of theory that both build upon and
    reject ideas established by structuralism,
    the intellectual project that preceded it.

    Post-structuralists believe that language
    is key when seeking to explain the social
    world.
    
    They argue that there is no reality
    external to the language we use.

metaphilosophy
philosophy of philosophy
    The investigation of the nature of
    philosophy".
    
    Its subject matter includes the aims of
    philosophy, the boundaries of philosophy,
    and its methods.
    
    Thus, while philosophy characteristically
    inquires into the nature of being, the
    reality of objects, the possibility of
    knowledge, the nature of truth, and so on,
    metaphilosophy is the self-reflective
    inquiry into the nature, aims, and methods
    of the activity that makes these kinds of
    inquiries, by asking what is philosophy
    itself, what sorts of questions it should
    ask, how it might pose and answer them,
    and what it can achieve in doing so.
    
    It is considered by some to be a subject
    prior and preparatory to philosophy, while
    others see it as inherently a part of
    philosophy, or automatically a part of
    philosophy while others adopt some
    combination of these views.

axiology
    Axiology is derived from the Greek to mean
    “value or worth,” and is primarily
    concerned with classifying things as good
    and how good they are.
    
    Often called the theory of value, axiology
    is the philosophical study of goodness or
    the worth of something.

systems philosophy
    A discipline aimed at constructing a new
    philosophy (in the sense of worldview) by
    using systems concepts.
    
    The discipline was first described by
    Ervin Laszlo in his 1972 book Introduction
    to Systems Philosophy: Toward a New
    Paradigm of Contemporary Thought.
    
    It has been described as the
    "reorientation of thought and world view
    ensuing from the introduction of "systems"
    as a new scientific paradigm".

transcendental idealism
    A philosophical system founded by German
    philosopher Immanuel Kant in the 18th
    century.
    
    Kant's epistemological program is found
    throughout his Critique of Pure Reason.

principle of sufficient reason
    States that everything must have a reason
    or a cause.
    
    The principle was articulated and made
    prominent by Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz,
    with many antecedents, and was further
    used and developed by Arthur Schopenhauer
    and Sir William Hamilton, 9th Baronet.

phenomenology
    A philosophy of experience.
    
    For phenomenology the ultimate source of
    all meaning and value is the lived
    experience of human beings.
    
    All philosophical systems, scientific
    theories, or aesthetic judgments have the
    status of abstractions from the ebb and
    flow of the lived world.

Contingency in Sartre
    The view that whatever exists, need not
    exist, and that therefore it can be
    changed; that the fact that one is born
    white or black without their choice, has
    no moral weight at all in treating others
    as though they are responsible for what
    they are.

abductive instinct
    See:
    - "abductive reasoning"

abductive reasoning
abduction
abductive inference
retroduction
    Making a probable conclusion from what you
    know.
    
    If you see an abandoned bowl of hot soup
    on the table, you can use abduction to
    conclude the owner of the soup is likely
    returning soon.

    A form of logical inference formulated and
    advanced by American philosopher Charles
    Sanders Peirce beginning in the last third
    of the 19th century.
    
    It starts with an observation or set of
    observations and then seeks the simplest
    and most likely conclusion from the
    observations.
    
    This process, unlike deductive reasoning,
    yields a plausible conclusion but does not
    positively verify it.
    
    Abductive conclusions are thus qualified
    as having a remnant of uncertainty or
    doubt, which is expressed in retreat terms
    such as "best available" or "most likely".
    
    One can understand abductive reasoning as
    inference to the best explanation,
    although not all usages of the terms
    abduction and inference to the best
    explanation are exactly equivalent.
    
    In the 1990s, as computing power grew, the
    fields of law, CS, and artificial
    intelligence research spurred renewed
    interest in the subject of abduction.
    
    Diagnostic expert systems frequently
    employ abduction.

deduction vs induction vs adbduction

    https://www.merriam-webster.com/words-at-play/deduction-vs-induction-vs-abduction

deduction
deductive reasoning
    Making an inference based on widely
    accepted facts or premises.

    If a beverage is defined as "drinkable
    through a straw," one could use deduction
    to determine soup to be a beverage.

induction
inductive reasoning
    Making an inference based on an
    observation, often of a sample.

    You can induce that the soup is tasty if
    you observe all of your friends consuming
    it.

adbuction

abduction
adbuctive inference
abductive reasoning
retroduction
    Making a probable conclusion from what you
    know.

    If you see an abandoned bowl of hot soup
    on the table, you can use abduction to
    conclude the owner of the soup is likely
    returning soon.

    A form of logical inference formulated and
    advanced by American philosopher Charles
    Sanders Peirce beginning in the last third
    of the 19th century.

    It starts with an observation or set of
    observations and then seeks to find the
    simplest and most likely conclusion from
    the observations.

mind-body dualism
    [philosophical position]

    Mental phenomena are non-physical, or that
    the mind and body are distinct and
    separable.
    
    Thus, it encompasses a set of views about
    the relationship between mind and matter,
    as well as between subject and object, and
    is contrasted with other positions, such
    as physicalism and enactivism, in the
    mind–body problem.

René Descartes

    Said "day cart".

    French-born philosopher, mathematician,
    and scientist.

ghost in the machine
    British philosopher Gilbert Ryle's
    description of René Descartes' mind-body
    dualism.

    Ryle introduced the phrase in The Concept
    of Mind to highlight the view of Descartes
    and others that mental and physical
    activity occur simultaneously but
    separately.

    A verb form which is used when the subject
    and object are the same.

reflexive
    [logic]

mysterianism
    [philosophical position]

    Proposes that the hard problem of
    consciousness cannot be resolved by
    humans.

    The unresolvable problem is how to explain
    the existence of qualia.

    The belief that no one can know the
    ultimate nature of reality.

four basic types of reasoning:
four basic forms of logic:
    - deductive,
    - inductive,

    absolute ruler or by a small group of
    rulers.

Mnemosyne
    The goddess of memory in Greek mythology.
    
    "Mnemosyne" is derived from the same
    source as the word mnemonic, that being
    the Greek word mnēmē, which means
    "remembrance, memory".
    
    Mnemosyne is the mother of the nine Muses.

hysteresis
    The phenomenon in which the value of a
    physical property lags behind changes in
    the effect causing it, as for instance
    when magnetic induction lags behind the
    magnetizing force.

Good
    In most contexts, the concept of good
    denotes the conduct that should be
    preferred when posed with a choice between
    possible actions.
    
    Good is generally considered to be the
    opposite of evil and is of interest in the
    study of ethics, morality, philosophy, and
    religion.

postulation
    A suggestion or assumption of the
    existence, fact, or truth of something as
    a basis for reasoning, discussion, or
    belief.
    "discrepancies between empirical findings
    and theoretical postulations"

    (in ecclesiastical law) a nomination or
    election of someone to an ecclesiastical
    office subject to the sanction of a higher
    authority.

egalitarian
qualitarianism
    A school of thought within political
    philosophy that builds from the concept of
    social equality, prioritizing it for all
    people.
    
    Egalitarian doctrines are generally
    characterized by the idea that all humans
    are equal in fundamental worth or moral
    status.

historicity
    [philosophy]

    The idea or fact that something has a
    historical origin and developed through
    history: concepts, practices, values.
    
    This is opposed to the belief that the
    same thing, in particular normative
    institutions or correlated ideologies, is
    natural or essential and thus exists
    universally.

metamodernism
    A broad range of developments in culture
    and society that appear after and gesture
    beyond postmodernism, and at the same time
    attempt to characterize post-
    postmodernism.

    [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kl0caFRFoms][What is Metamodernism? - YouTube]]

    What's metamodern are aesthetic mannerisms
    that protect interiority against the self-
    doubt that potentially comes with multi-
    perspectivalism.
    
    An uncomplicated embrace of positivity:
    The postmodern sensibility often made it
    embarrassing to express positive emotions,
    such as hope, enthusiasm, glee, and so on.

rudiment
    The first principles of (a subject).
    "she taught the girls the rudiments of
    reading and writing"

mimetic
    The word is Greek and means “imitation”
    (though in the sense of “re-presentation”
    rather than of “copying”).

    Plato and Aristotle spoke of mimesis as
    the re-presentation of nature.

    Relating to, constituting, or habitually
    practising mimesis.
    "mimetic patterns in butterflies"

    one's philosophical theories.
    "Marx himself did not philosophize the
    issue"

reductionism
    Any of several related philosophical ideas
    regarding the associations between
    phenomena, which can be described in terms
    of other simpler or more fundamental
    phenomena.
    
    It is also described as an intellectual
    and philosophical position that interprets
    a complex system as the sum of its parts.

body without organs
    To "make oneself a body without organs,"
    then, is to actively experiment with
    oneself to draw out and activate these
    virtual potentials.
    
    These potentials are mostly activated (or
    "actualized") through conjunctions with
    other bodies (or BwOs) that Deleuze calls
    "becomings".

the schizophrenic
    A zero-intensity body without organs
    (BwO); whereas the schizo's body is a
    surface on which to record the flows of
    desire.

teleological argument
physico-theological argument

Necessary Illusions: Thought Control in Democratic Societies
    A 1989 book by United States academic Noam
    Chomsky concerning political power using
    propaganda to distort and distract from
    major issues to maintain confusion and
    complicity, preventing real democracy from
    becoming effective.

The Homeric Question
    Concerns the doubts and consequent debate
    over the identity of Homer, the authorship
    of the Iliad and Odyssey, and their
    historicity (especially concerning the
    Iliad).

    Every civilization has expressed its views
    on language; one could even say that
    language is something of a “Homeric
    question” for humanity: a question
    indirectly reflecting the pillars
    supporting that culture.

panpsychism
    [philosophy of mind]

    The view that mind or a mindlike aspect is
    a fundamental and ubiquitous feature of
    reality.
    
    It is also described as a theory that "the
    mind is a fundamental feature of the world
    which exists throughout the universe."

John Locke
    Holds that personal identity is a matter
    of psychological continuity.
    
    He considered personal identity (or the
    self) to be founded on consciousness (viz.
    memory), and not on the substance of
    either the soul or the body.

Empiricism
    A theory that states that knowledge comes
    only or primarily from sensory experience.
    
    It is one of several views of
    epistemology, along with rationalism and
    skepticism.
    
    Empiricism emphasizes the role of
    empirical evidence in the formation of
    ideas, rather than innate ideas or
    traditions.

nativist
Nativism
    A person who advocates the theory that
    concepts, mental capacities, and mental
    structures are innate rather than acquired
    by learning.
    "extreme views were put forward by
    nativists on the one hand and by
    empiricists on the other"

Materialism
    A form of philosophical monism that holds
    that matter is the fundamental substance
    in nature, and that all things, including
    mental states and consciousness, are
    results of material interactions.

secondness
brute secondness
    A fundamental category in Peircean
    philosophy comprising actual facts and
    expressive of necessity, force, and
    determination — compare firstness,
    thirdness.

philosophy
    Intentionality is the power of minds and
    mental states to be about, to represent,
    or to stand for, things, properties and
    states of affairs.
    
    To say of an individual’s mental states
    that they have intentionality is to say
    that they are mental representations or
    that they have contents.
    
    Furthermore, to the extent that a speaker
    utters words from some NL or draws
    pictures or symbols from a formal language
    for the purpose of conveying to others the
    contents of her mental states, these
    artifacts used by a speaker too have
    contents or intentionality.
    
    ‘Intentionality’ is a philosopher’s word:
    ever since it was introduced into
    philosophy by Franz Brentano in the last
    quarter of the nineteenth century, it has
    been used to refer to the puzzles of
    representation, all of which lie at the
    interface between the philosophy of mind
    and the philosophy of language.
    
    A picture of a dog, a proper name (e.g.,
    ‘Fido’), the common noun ‘dog’ or the
    concept expressed by the word can mean,
    represent, or stand for, one or several
    hairy barking creatures.
    
    A complete thought, a full sentence or a
    picture can stand for or describe a state
    of affairs

supertask
    A countably infinite sequence of
    operations that occur sequentially within
    a finite interval of time.
    
    The term supertask was coined by the
    philosopher James F. Thomson, who devised
    Thomson's lamp.
    
    The term hypertask derives from Clark and
    Read in their paper of that name.

hypertask
    Supertasks are called "hypertasks" when
    the number of operations becomes
    uncountably infinite.
    
ultratask
    A hypertask that includes one task for
    each ordinal number is called an
    "ultratask".
    
interpellate
    [#philosophy]

    (of an ideology or discourse)
    bring into being or give identity to (an
    individual or category).

    [#Marxism]

    The process by which we encounter a
    culture's or ideology's values and
    internalize them.

infinite regress
    An infinite series of entities governed by
    a recursive principle that determines how
    each entity in the series depends on or is
    produced by its predecessor.
    
    In the epistemic regress, for example, a
    belief is justified because it is based on
    another belief that is justified.

René Girard
René Noël Théophile Girard
    [French historian]
    [philosopher]

    A French polymath, historian, literary
    critic, and philosopher of social science
    whose work belongs to the tradition of
    anthropological philosophy.
    
    Girard was the author of nearly thirty
    books, with his writings spanning many
    academic domains

Irrealism
    [#Philosophy]

    Irrealism is a philosophical position
    first advanced by Nelson Goodman in "Ways
    of Worldmaking", encompassing
    epistemology, metaphysics, and aesthetics.

consequentialism
    The doctrine that the morality of an
    action is to be judged solely by its
    consequences.

nihilism
    The belief that all values are baseless
    and that nothing can be known or
    communicated.
    
    It is often associated with extreme
    pessimism and a radical skepticism that
    condemns existence.
    
    A true nihilist would believe in nothing,
    have no loyalties, and no purpose other
    than, perhaps, an impulse to destroy.

realism
Philosophical realism
    Usually not treated as a position of its
    own but as a stance towards other subject
    matters.
    
    Realism about a certain kind of thing is
    the thesis that this kind of thing has
    mind-independent existence, i.e. that it
    is not just a mere appearance in the eye
    of the beholder.

nominalism
    The doctrine that universals or general
    ideas are mere names without any
    corresponding reality.
    
    Only particular objects exist, and
    properties, numbers, and sets are merely
    features of the way of considering the
    things that exist.
    
    Important in medieval scholastic thought,
    nominalism is associated particularly with
    William of Occam.

Axiology
    The philosophical study of value.
    
    It is either the collective term for
    ethics and aesthetics, philosophical
    fields that depend crucially on notions of
    worth, or the foundation for these fields,
    and thus similar to value theory and meta-
    ethics.

Ontology
    The branch of philosophy that studies
    concepts such as existence, being,
    becoming, and reality.
    
    It includes the questions of how entities
    are grouped into basic categories and
    which of these entities exist on the most
    fundamental level.

Epistemology
    The branch of philosophy concerned with
    knowledge.
    
    Epistemologists study the nature of
    knowledge, epistemic justification, the
    rationality of belief, and various related
    issues.
    
    Epistemology is considered one of the four
    main branches of philosophy, along with
    ethics, logic, and metaphysics.

Polanyi's Paradox
    [theory]

    We can know more than we can tell.
    
    Human knowledge of how the world functions
    and capability are, to a large extent,
    beyond our explicit understanding.

    Explains the cognitive phenomenon that
    there exist many tasks which we, human
    beings, understand intuitively how to
    perform but cannot verbalize the rules or
    procedures behind it.
    
    This "self-ignorance" is common to many
    human activities, from driving a car in
    traffic to face recognition.
    
    Humans are relying on their tacit
    knowledge, which is difficult to
    adequately express by verbal means, when
    engaging these tasks.
    
    Has been widely considered a major
    obstacle in the fields of AI and
    automation, since the absence of
    consciously accessible knowledge creates
    tremendous difficulty in programming.
    
    Overcomed by recent advances in ML, some
    technological optimists argue.
    
    Instead of relaying on programmer’s
    algorithms to instruct them in human
    knowledge, computer systems are now able
    to learn tacit rules from context,
    abundant data, and applied statistics on
    their own.
    
    Since machines can infer the tacit
    knowledge that human beings draw upon from
    examples without human assistance, they
    are no longer limited by those rules
    tacitly applied but not explicitly
    understood by humans.
