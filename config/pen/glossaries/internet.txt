Sideloading
    A term used mostly on the Internet,
    similar to "upload" and "download", but in
    reference to the process of transferring
    files between two local devices, in
    particular between a computer and a mobile
    device such as a mobile phone, smartphone,
    PDA, etc.

    Typically refers to media file transfer to
    a mobile device via USB, Bluetooth, WiFi
    or by writing to a memory card for
    insertion into the mobile device.
    
    When referring to Android apps,
    "sideloading" typically means installing
    an application package in APK format onto
    an Android device.
