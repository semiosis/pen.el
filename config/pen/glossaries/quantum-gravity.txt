holographic principle
    A tenet of string theories and a supposed
    property of quantum gravity that states
    that the description of a volume of space
    can be thought of as encoded on a lower-
    dimensional boundary to the regionâ€”such as
    a light-like boundary like a gravitational
    horizon.

    An imaginary surface beyond which all null
    geodesics recede from the observer.
    
    The Universe has an apparent
    (gravitational) horizon, but unlike its
    counterpart in the Schwarzschild and Kerr
    metrics, it is not static.
    
    It may eventually turn into an event
    horizon---an asymptotically defined
    membrane that forever separates causally
    connected events from those that are not
    ---depending on the equation of state of
    the cosmic fluid.
    
    In this paper, we examine how and why an
    apparent (gravitational) horizon is
    manifested in the Friedmann-Robertson-
    Walker metric, and why it is becoming so
    pivotal to our correct interpretation of
    the cosmological data.
    
    We discuss its observational signature and
    demonstrate how it alone defines the
    proper size of our visible Universe.
    
    In so doing, we affirm its physical
    reality and its impact on cosmological
    models.

    A boundary beyond which events cannot
    affect an observer.
