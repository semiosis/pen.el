crepuscular rays
    Sunbeams that originate when the Sun is
    just below the horizon, during the
    twilight period.
    
    Crepuscular rays are noticeable when the
    contrast between light and dark is most
    obvious.
    
    Crepuscular comes from the Latin word
    crepusculum, meaning "twilight".
    
    Crepuscular rays usually appear orange
    because the path through the atmosphere at
    sunrise and sunset passes through up to 40
    times as much air as rays from a high Sun
    at midday.
    
    Particles in the air scatter short-
    wavelength light (blue and green) through
    Rayleigh scattering much more strongly
    than longer-wavelength yellow and red
    light.
    
    Loosely, the term crepuscular rays is
    sometimes extended to the general
    phenomenon of rays of sunlight that appear
    to converge at a point in the sky,
    irrespective of time of day.

anticrepuscular rays
antisolar rays
    Meteorological optical phenomena similar
    to crepuscular rays, but appear opposite
    the Sun in the sky.
    
    Anticrepuscular rays are essentially
    parallel, but appear to converge toward
    the antisolar point, the vanishing point,
    due to a visual illusion from linear
    perspective.
    
    Anticrepuscular rays are most frequently
    visible around sunrise or sunset.
    
    This is because the atmospheric light
    scattering that makes them visible
    (backscattering) is larger for low angles
    to the horizon than most other angles.
    
    Anticrepuscular rays are dimmer than
    crepuscular rays because backscattering is
    less than forward scattering.
    
    Anticrepuscular rays can be continuous
    with crepuscular rays, curving across the
    whole sky in great circles.

afterglow
    A broad arch of whitish or pinkish
    sunlight in the sky that is scattered by
    fine particulates, like dust, suspended in
    the atmosphere.
    
    An afterglow may appear above the highest
    clouds in the hour of fading twilight or
    be reflected off high snowfields in
    mountain regions long after sunset.
    
    The particles produce a scattering effect
    upon the component parts of white light.
    
    True alpenglow, which occurs long after
    sunset or long before sunrise, is caused
    by the backscattering of red sunlight by
    aerosols and fine dust particles low in
    the atmosphere.
    
    After sunset, alpenglow is an afterglow
    caused by the illumination of atmospheric
    particles by sunlight as it gets refracted
    and scattered through the Earth's
    atmosphere.
    
    The high-energy and high-frequency light
    is scattered out the most, while the
    remaining low-energy and -frequency light
    reaches the observer on the horizon at
    twilight.
    
    The backscattering of this light further
    turns it pinkish to reddish.
    
    This period of time is referred to as the
    blue hour and is widely treasured by
    photographers and painters.
    
    The afterglow persists until the Earth's
    shadow (terminator line) overtakes the sky
    above the observer as night falls and the
    stars appear.

foreglow
    The opposite of an afterglow is a
    foreglow, which occurs before sunrise.
    
gegenschein
counter-shine
    A faintly bright spot in the night sky
    centered at the antisolar point.
    
    The backscatter of sunlight by
    interplanetary dust causes this optical
    phenomenon, also called counterglow.

Belt of Venus
Venus's Girdle
antitwilight arch
antitwilight
    An atmospheric phenomenon visible shortly
    before sunrise or after sunset, during
    civil twilight.
    
    It is a pinkish glow that surrounds the
    observer, extending roughly 10–20° above
    the horizon.
    
    In a way, the Belt of Venus is actually
    alpenglow visible near the horizon during
    twilight, above the antisolar point.
    
    Like alpenglow, the backscatter of
    reddened sunlight also creates the Belt of
    Venus.
    
    Unlike alpenglow, the sunlight scattered
    by fine particulates that cause the rosy
    arch of the Belt shines high in the
    atmosphere and lasts for a while after
    sunset or before sunrise.
    
    As twilight progresses, the arch is
    separated from the horizon by the dark
    band of Earth's shadow, or "twilight
    wedge".
    
    The pinkish glow is due to the Rayleigh
    scattering of light from the rising or
    setting Sun, which is then backscattered
    by particulates.
    
    A similar effect can be seen on a "blood
    moon" during a total lunar eclipse.
    
    The zodiacal light and gegenschein, which
    are caused by the diffuse reflection of
    sunlight from interplanetary dust in the
    Solar System, are also similar phenomena.
    
    The Belt of Venus can be observed as
    having a vivider pink color during the
    winter months, as opposed to the summer
    months, when it appears faded and dim
    above the yellowish-orange band near the
    horizon

golden hour
    [#photography]

    The period of daytime shortly after
    sunrise or before sunset, during which
    daylight is redder and softer than when
    the sun is higher in the sky.
    
    The golden hour is also sometimes called
    the "magic hour," especially by
    cinematographers and photographers.
    
    During these times, the brightness of the
    sky matches the brightness of
    streetlights, signs, car headlights and
    lit windows.
    
    The period of time shortly before the
    magic hour at sunrise, or after it at
    sunset, is called the "blue hour".
    
    This is when the sun is at a significant
    depth below the horizon, when residual,
    indirect sunlight takes on a predominantly
    blue shade, and there are no sharp shadows
    because the sun either has not risen, or
    has set.

blue hour
    The period of twilight (in the morning or
    evening, around the nautical stage) when
    the Sun is at a significant depth below
    the horizon.
    
    During this time, the remaining sunlight
    takes on a mostly blue shade.
    
    This shade differs from the colour of the
    sky on a clear day, which is caused by
    Rayleigh scattering.
    
    The blue hour occurs when the Sun is far
    enough below the horizon so that the
    sunlight's blue wavelengths dominate due
    to the Chappuis absorption caused by
    ozone.
    
    Since the term is colloquial, it lacks an
    official definition such as dawn, dusk, or
    the three stages of twilight.
    
    Rather, blue hour refers to the state of
    natural lighting that usually occurs
    around the nautical stage of the twilight
    period (at dawn or dusk).

Earth's shadow
Earth shadow
    The shadow that Earth itself casts through
    its atmosphere and into outer space,
    toward the antisolar point.
    
    During the twilight period (both early
    dusk and late dawn), the shadow's visible
    fringe – sometimes called the dark segment
    or twilight wedge – appears as a dark and
    diffuse band just above the horizon, most
    distinct when the sky is clear.

Brocken spectre
Brocken bow
mountain spectre
spectre of the Brocken
    The magnified (and apparently enormous)
    shadow of an observer cast in mid air upon
    any type of cloud opposite to a strong
    light source.
    
    Additionally if the cloud consists of
    water droplets backscattered a bright area
    called heiligenschein and halo-like rings
    of rainbow coloured light called a glory
    can be seen around the head or apperature
    silhouette of the spectre.
    
    Typically the spectre appears in sunlight
    opposite to the Sun's direction at the
    antisolar point.

airglow
nightglow
    A faint emission of light by a planetary
    atmosphere.
    
    In the case of Earth's atmosphere, this
    optical phenomenon causes the night sky
    never to be completely dark, even after
    the effects of starlight and diffused
    sunlight from the far side are removed.
    
    This phenomenon originates with self
    illuminated gases and it has no
    relationship with Earth's magnetism and
    sun spot activity.
