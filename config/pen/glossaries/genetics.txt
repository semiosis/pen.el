De novo
    [#mutation]

    An alteration in a gene that is present
    for the first time in one family member as
    a result of a mutation in a germ cell (egg
    or sperm) of one of the parents or in the
    fertilized egg itself.

De novo
    [#protein design]
    
    Creation of a protein sequence that is not
    based on existing, natural sequences.

De novo
    [#protein structure prediction]
    
    Prediction of a protein's 3D structure,
    based only on its sequence.

De novo
    [#transcriptome assembly]
    [method]
    
    Creating a transcriptome without a
    reference genome.

transcriptome
    Sum total of all the messenger RNA
    molecules expressed from the genes of an
    organism.

    Because these pathways are "conserved,"
    meaning that they have been passed down to
    humans through evolution, they have been
    the subject of intensive research.
    
    A number of drugs that extend healthy
    lifespan by altering these pathways are
    now under development.
    
    The discovery of the synergistic effect
    opens the door to even more effective
    anti-aging therapies.

Pseudogene
    Other non-human mammals can produce
    Vitamin C.

    They donâ€™t need it from their diet.

    Humans, on the other hand, have had
    ancestors that have been eating fruit for
    so long (which is high in vitamin C) that
    our vitamin C genes long ago mutated.

    We do, however, still possess its remnant
    in pseudogene form.
