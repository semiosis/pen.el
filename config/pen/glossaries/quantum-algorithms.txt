    Back in 1996, a quantum physicist at Bell
    Labs in New Jersey published a new recipe
    for searching through a database of N
    entries.
    
    Computer scientists have long known that
    this process takes around N steps because
    in the worst case, the last item on the
    list could be the one of interest.
    
    However, this physicist, Lov Grover,
    showed how the strange rules of quantum
    mechanics allowed the search to be done in
    a number of steps equal to the square root
    of N.
