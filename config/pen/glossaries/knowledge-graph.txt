KG
    Consist of factual information represented
    explicitly in a structured format,
    generally in the form of [subject entity,
    relation, object entity] triples.

    A KG can be viewed as interconnected
    entity subgraphs.               

entity subgraph
    A group of related triples is called an
    entity subgraph.

    An example of an entity subgraph that
    builds on the previous example of a triple
    is { [210x10 photobooks, instance of,
    Nonprofit Organization] }.
