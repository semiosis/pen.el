Self-supervised learning
    A method of ML.
    
    It learns from unlabeled sample data.
    
    It can be regarded as an intermediate form
    between supervised and unsupervised
    learning.
    
    It is based on an ANN.
    
    The NN learns in two steps.

    You're still bringing together those
    components but now you're trying to create
    something novel that actually your brain
    judges as unfamiliar.

    If memory is heavily depend on the
    hippocampus then maybe imagination is also
    a very heavily dependent on the same brain
    structure and the same processes.

    We now know that it is.

    Involved with is reconstructing that
    pulling all those parts together into a
    coherent whole which then is recognized by
    the rest of your brain as actually an
    episodic memory.

Winograd schema challenge
Winograd schema
    Designed to be an improvement on the
    Turing test, it is a multiple-choice test
    that employs questions of a very specific
    structure: they are instances of what are
    called Winograd schemas.

    Weaknesses of the Turing test:
        The performance of Eugene Goostman
        exhibited some of the Turing test's
        problems.
        
        Levesque identifies several major
        issues, summarized as follows:
    
        - Deception:
          The machine is forced to construct a
          false identity, which is not part of
          intelligence.

        - Conversation:
          A lot of interaction may qualify as
          "legitimate conversation"—jokes,
          clever asides, points of
          order—without requiring intelligent
          reasoning.

        - Evaluation:
          Humans make mistakes and judges
          often would disagree on the results.

    The heart:
    - A machine (the learner) that requests
      labels for datapoints that it finds
      particularly hard to predict.

      It follows a strategy, and uses it to
      identify these datapoints.

    To evaluate the effectiveness of the
    strategy, a simple approach for choosing
    datapoints needs to be defined.

    A good starting point is to remove the
    intelligence of the learner; the
    datapoints are chosen independently of
    what the learner thinks.

    Active learning allows us to be smart
    about picking the right set of datapoints
    for which to create labels.
    
    Done properly, this approach results in
    models that are trained on less data
    performing comparatively to models trained
    on much more data.
    
    In the world of meta-learning, we do not
    focus on label acquisition; rather, we
    attempt to build a machine that learns
    quickly from a small number of training
    data.

    It is different to automated computer

    Computer aided diagnosis has already been
    used extensively within radiology, it is a
    powerful tool as computer algorithms and
    clinicians complement each other in a way
    which improves the accuracy of a
    diagnosis.

Imaging data sets
    The aggregation of an imaging data set is
    a critical step in building AI for

    Many data sets for building convolutional
    neural networks for image identification
    involve at least thousands of images but
    smaller data sets are useful for texture

Reinforcement learning
RL
    An area of ML concerned with how
    intelligent agents ought to take actions
    in an environment in order to maximize the
    notion of cumulative reward.
    
    RL is one of three basic ML paradigms,
    alongside supervised learning and
    unsupervised learning.

    Basically, it deals with learning via
    interaction and feedback, or in other
    words learning to solve a task by trial
    and error, or in other-other words acting
    in an environment and receiving rewards
    for it.
    
    Essentially an agent (or several) is built
    that can perceive and interpret the
    environment in which is placed,
    furthermore, it can take actions and
    interact with it.

    Example:
        Your cat is an agent that is exposed
        to the environment.
        
        The biggest characteristic of this
        method is that there is no supervisor,
        only a real number or reward signal.
        
        Two types of RL are 1) Positive 2)
        Negative.

Agent
    The learner and the decision maker.

Environment
    Where the agent learns and decides what
    actions to perform.

Action
    A set of actions which the agent can
    perform.

State
    The state of the agent in the environment.

Reward
    For each action selected by the agent the
    environment provides a reward. Usually a
    scalar value.

Policy
    The decision-making function (control
    strategy) of the agent, which represents a
    mapping from situations to actions.

Value function
    Mapping from states to real numbers, where
    the value of a state represents the
    long-term reward achieved starting from
    that state, and executing a particular
    policy.

Function approximator
    Refers to the problem of inducing a
    function from training examples. Standard
    approximators include decision trees,
    neural networks, and nearest-neighbor
    methods

Markov decision process
MDP
    A probabilistic model of a sequential
    decision problem, where states can be
    perceived exactly, and the current state
    and action selected determine a
    probability distribution on future states.
    Essentially, the outcome of applying an
    action to a state depends only on the
    current action and state (and not on
    preceding actions or states).

Dynamic programming
DP
    Is a class of solution methods for solving
    sequential decision problems with a
    compositional cost structure. Richard
    Bellman was one of the principal founders
    of this approach.

Monte Carlo methods
    A class of methods for learning of value
    functions, which estimates the value of a
    state by running many trials starting at
    that state, then averages the total
    rewards received on those trials.

Temporal Difference algorithms
TD algorithms
    A class of learning methods, based on the
    idea of comparing temporally successive
    predictions. Possibly the single most
    fundamental idea in all of reinforcement
    learning.

Model
    The agent's view of the environment, which
    maps state-action pairs to probability
    distributions over states. Note that not
    every reinforcement learning agent uses a
    model of its environment
