Entoptic phenomenon
Entoptic phenomena
    Visual effects whose source is within the
    human eye itself.
    
    In Helmholtz's words:
    "Under suitable conditions light falling
    on the eye may render visible certain
    objects within the eye itself.  These
    perceptions are called entoptical."
