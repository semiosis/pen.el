ring theory
    [#algebra]

    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ring_theory

    The study of rings[1]—algebraic structures
    in which addition and multiplication are
    defined and have similar properties to
    those operations defined for the integers.
    Ring theory studies the structure of
    rings, their representations, or, in
    different language, modules, special
    classes of rings (group rings, division
    rings, universal enveloping algebras), as
    well as an array of properties that proved
    to be of interest both within the theory
    itself and for its applications, such as
    homological properties and polynomial
    identities.

    Commutative rings are much better
    understood than noncommutative ones.
    Algebraic geometry and algebraic number
    theory, which provide many natural
    examples of commutative rings, have driven
    much of the development of commutative
    ring theory, which is now, under the name
    of commutative algebra, a major area of
    modern mathematics. Because these three
    fields (algebraic geometry, algebraic
    number theory and commutative algebra) are
    so intimately connected it is usually
    difficult and meaningless to decide which
    field a particular result belongs to. For
    example, Hilbert's Nullstellensatz is a
    theorem which is fundamental for algebraic
    geometry, and is stated and proved in
    terms of commutative algebra. Similarly,
    Fermat's Last Theorem is stated in terms
    of elementary arithmetic, which is a part
    of commutative algebra, but its proof
    involves deep results of both algebraic
    number theory and algebraic geometry.

    Noncommutative rings are quite different
    in flavour, since more unusual behavior
    can arise. While the theory has developed
    in its own right, a fairly recent trend
    has sought to parallel the commutative
    development by building the theory of
    certain classes of noncommutative rings in
    a geometric fashion as if they were rings
    of functions on (non-existent)
    'noncommutative spaces'. This trend
    started in the 1980s with the development
    of noncommutative geometry and with the
    discovery of quantum groups. It has led to
    a better understanding of noncommutative
    rings, especially noncommutative
    Noetherian rings.[2]

    For the definitions of a ring and basic
    concepts and their properties, see Ring
    (mathematics). The definitions of terms
    used throughout ring theory may be found
    in Glossary of ring theory.

Amitsur complex
    The Amitsur complex of a ring homomorphism
    is a cochain complex that measures the
    extent in which the ring homomorphism
    fails to be faithfully flat.

Artinian
    A left Artinian ring is a ring satisfying
    the descending chain condition for left
    ideals; a right Artinian ring is one
    satisfying the descending chain condition
    for right ideals. If a ring is both left
    and right Artinian, it is called Artinian.
    Artinian rings are Noetherian rings.

Artin-Wedderbun theorem
    The Artin–Wedderburn theorem states that a
    semisimple ring is a finite product of
    (full) matrix rings over division rings.

associate
    In a commutative ring, an element a is
    called an associate of an element b if a
    divides b and b divides a.

automorphism
    A ring automorphism is a ring isomorphism
    between the same ring; in other words, it
    is a unit element of the endomorphism ring
    of the ring that is multiplicative and
    preserves the multiplicative identity.

    An algebra automorphism over a commutative
    ring R is an algebra isomorphism between
    the same algebra; it is a ring
    automorphism that is also R-linear.

    An Azumaya algebra is a generalization of
    a central simple algebra to a non-field
    base ring.

    The bidimension of an associative algebra
    A over a commutative ring R is the
    projective dimension of {\displaystyle A}A
    as an {\displaystyle A^{op}\otimes
    _{R}A}{\displaystyle A^{op}\otimes
    _{R}A}-module. For example, an algebra has
    bidimension zero if and only if it is
    separable.

boolean
    A boolean ring is a ring in which every
    element is multiplicatively idempotent.

    the morphisms are (all) the ring
    homomorphisms.

center
    1. An element r of a ring R is central if
       xr = rx for all x in R. The set of all
       central elements forms a subring of R,
       known as the center of R.
    2. A central algebra is an associative
       algebra over the center.

    1.  The centralizer of a subset S of a ring is the subring of the ring consisting of the elements commuting with the elements of S. For example, the centralizer of the ring itself is the center of the ring.
    2.  The double centralizer of a set is the centralizer of the centralizer of the set. Cf. double centralizer theorem.

characteristic
    1.  The characteristic of a ring is the smallest positive integer n satisfying nx = 0 for all elements x of the ring, if such an n exists. Otherwise, the characteristic is 0.
    2.  The characteristic subring of R is the smallest subring (i.e., the unique minimal subring). It is necessary the image of the unique ring homomorphism {\displaystyle \mathbb {Z} \to R}{\mathbb  {Z}}\to R and thus is isomorphic to {\displaystyle \mathbb {Z} /n}\mathbb {Z} /n where n is the characteristic of R.

change
    A change of rings is a functor (between
    appropriate categories) induced by a ring
    homomorphism.

    associative algebra that is useful in
    geometry and physics.

coherent
    A left coherent ring is a ring such that
    every finitely generated left ideal of it
    is a finitely presented module; in other
    words, it is coherent as a left module
    over itself.

commutative
    1.  A ring R is commutative if the multiplication is commutative, i.e. rs = sr for all r,s ∈ R.
    2.  A ring R is skew-commutative if {\displaystyle xy=(-1)^{\epsilon (x)\epsilon (y)}yx}{\displaystyle xy=(-1)^{\epsilon (x)\epsilon (y)}yx} where {\displaystyle \epsilon (x)}\epsilon (x) denotes the parity of an element x.

    2.  The derivation algebra of an algebra A is the subalgebra of the endomorphism algebra of A that consists of derivations.

differential
    A differential algebra is an algebra
    together with a derivation.

direct
    A direct product of a family of rings is a
    ring given by taking the cartesian product
    of the given rings and defining the
    algebraic operations component-wise.

divisor
    1.  In an integral domain R,[clarification needed] an element a is called a divisor of the element b (and we say a divides b) if there exists an element x in R with ax = b.
    2.  An element r of R is a left zero divisor if there exists a nonzero element x in R such that rx = 0 and a right zero divisor or if there exists a nonzero element y in R such that yr = 0. An element r of R is a called a two-sided zero divisor if it is both a left zero divisor and a right zero divisor.

division
    A division ring or skew field is a ring in
    which every nonzero element is a unit and
    1 ≠ 0.

domain
    A domain is a nonzero ring with no zero
    divisors except 0. For a historical
    reason, a commutative domain is called an
    integral domain.

endomorphism
    An endomorphism ring is a ring formed by
    the endomorphisms of an object with
    additive structure; the multiplication is
    taken to be function composition, while
    its addition is pointwise addition of the
    images.

enveloping algebra
    The (universal) enveloping algebra E of a
    not-necessarily-associative algebra A is
    the associative algebra determined by A in
    some universal way. The best known example
    is the universal enveloping algebra of a
    Lie algebra.

extension
    A ring extension of a ring R by an abelian
    group I is a pair {\displaystyle
    (E,\varphi )}{\displaystyle (E,\varphi )}
    consisting of a ring E and a ring
    homomorphism {\displaystyle \varphi :E\to
    R}{\displaystyle \varphi :E\to R} whose
    kernel is I.

exterior algebra
    The exterior algebra of a vector space or
    a module V is the quotient of the tensor
    algebra of V by the ideal generated by
    elements of the form {\displaystyle
    x\otimes x}{\displaystyle x\otimes x}.

    i.e., a nonzero ring in which each nonzero
    element is invertible.

filtered ring
    A filtered ring is a ring with a
    filtration.

    1.  A left ideal I is finitely generated if there exist finitely many elements a1, ..., an such that I = Ra1 + ... + Ran. A right ideal I is finitely generated if there exist finitely many elements a1, ..., an such that I = a1R + ... + anR.

    commutative ring R is a (commutative)
    associative algebra that is a quotient of
    a polynomial ring over R in finitely many
    variables by a finitely generated
    ideal.[1]

free
    1.  A free ideal ring or a fir is a ring in which every right ideal is a free module of fixed rank.
    2.  A semifir is a ring in which every finitely generated right ideal is a free module of fixed rank.
    3.  The free product of a family of associative is an associative algebra obtained, roughly, by the generators and the relations of the algebras in the family. The notion depends on which category of associative algebra is considered; for example, in the category of commutative rings, a free product is a tensor product.
    4.  A free ring is a ring that is a free algebra over the integers.

graded
    A graded ring is a ring together with a
    grading or a graduation; i.e, it is a
    direct sum of additive subgroups with the
    multiplication that respects the grading.
    For example, a polynomial ring is a graded
    ring by degrees of polynomials.

generate
    An associative algebra A over a
    commutative ring R is said to be generated
    by a subset S of A if the smallest
    subalgebra containing S is A itself and S
    is said to be the generating set of A. If
    there is a finite generating set, A is
    said to be a finitely generated algebra.

hereditary
    A ring is left hereditary if its left
    ideals are all projective modules. Right
    hereditary rings are defined analogously.

ideal
    A left ideal I of R is an additive
    subgroup of R such that aI ⊆ I for all a ∈
    R. A right ideal is a subgroup of R such
    that Ia ⊆ I for all a ∈ R. An ideal
    (sometimes called a two-sided ideal for
    emphasis) is a subgroup which is both a
    left ideal and a right ideal.

idempotent
    An element r of a ring is idempotent if r2
    = r.

integral domain
    "integral domain" or "entire ring" is
    another name for a commutative domain;
    i.e., a nonzero commutative ring with no
    zero divisors except 0.

invariant
    A ring R has invariant basis number if Rm
    isomorphic to Rn as R-modules implies m =
    n.

irreducible
    An element x of an integral domain is
    irreducible if it is not a unit and for
    any elements a and b such that x = ab,
    either a or b is a unit. Note that every
    prime element is irreducible, but not
    necessarily vice versa.

Jacobson
    1.  The Jacobson radical of a ring is the intersection of all maximal left ideals.
    2.  A Jacobson ring is a ring in which each prime ideal is an intersection of primitive ideals.

kernel
    The kernel of a ring homomorphism of a
    ring homomorphism f : R → S is the set of
    all elements x of R such that f(x) = 0.
    Every ideal is the kernel of a ring
    homomorphism and vice versa.

Köthe
    Köthe's conjecture states that if a ring
    has a nonzero nil right ideal, then it has
    a nonzero nil ideal.

local
    1.  A ring with a unique maximal left ideal is a local ring. These rings also have a unique maximal right ideal, and the left and the right unique maximal ideals coincide. Certain commutative rings can be embedded in local rings via localization at a prime ideal.
    2.  A localization of a ring : For commutative rings, a technique to turn a given set of elements of a ring into units. It is named Localization because it can be used to make any given ring into a local ring. To localize a ring R, take a multiplicatively closed subset S containing no zero divisors, and formally define their multiplicative inverses, which shall be added into R. Localization in noncommutative rings is more complicated, and has been in defined several different ways.

minimal and maximal
    1.  A left ideal M of the ring R is a maximal left ideal (resp. minimal left ideal) if it is maximal (resp. minimal) among proper (resp. nonzero) left ideals. Maximal (resp. minimal) right ideals are defined similarly.
    2.  A maximal subring is a subring that is maximal among proper subrings. A "minimal subring" can be defined analogously; it is unique and is called the characteristic subring.

matrix
    1.  A matrix ring over a ring R is a ring whose elements are square matrices of fixed size with the entries in R. The matrix ring or the full matrix ring of matrices over R is the matrix ring consisting of all square matrices of fixed size with the entries in R. When the grammatical construction is not workable, the term "matrix ring" often refers to the "full" matrix ring when the context makes no confusion likely; for example, when one says a semsimple ring is a product of matrix rings of division rings, it is implicitly assumed that "matrix rings" refer to "full matrix rings". Every ring is (isomorphic to) the full matrix ring over itself.
    2.  The ring of generic matrices is the ring consisting of square matrices with entries in formal variables.

monoid
    A monoid ring.

Morita
    Two rings are said to be Morita equivalent
    if the category of modules over the one is
    equivalent to the category of modules over
    the other.

nearring
    A nearring is a structure that is a group
    under addition, a semigroup under
    multiplication, and whose multiplication
    distributes on the right over addition.

nil
    1.  A nil ideal is an ideal consisting of nilpotent elements.
    2.  The (Baer) upper nil radical is the sum of all nil ideals.
    3.  The (Baer) lower nil radical is the intersection of all prime ideals. For a commutative ring, the upper nil radical and the lower nil radical coincide.

nilpotent
    1.  An element r of R is nilpotent if there exists a positive integer n such that rn = 0.
    2.  A nil ideal is an ideal whose elements are nilpotent elements.
    3.  A nilpotent ideal is an ideal whose power Ik is {0} for some positive integer k. Every nilpotent ideal is nil, but the converse is not true in general.
    4.  The nilradical of a commutative ring is the ideal that consists of all nilpotent elements of the ring. It is equal to the intersection of all the ring's prime ideals and is contained in, but in general not equal to, the ring's Jacobson radical.

Noetherian
    A left Noetherian ring is a ring
    satisfying the ascending chain condition
    for left ideals. A right Noetherian is
    defined similarly and a ring that is both
    left and right Noetherian is Noetherian. A
    ring is left Noetherian if and only if all
    its left ideals are finitely generated;
    analogously for right Noetherian rings.

null
    null ring: See rng of square zero.

opposite
    Given a ring R, its opposite ring Rop has
    the same underlying set as R, the addition
    operation is defined as in R, but the
    product of s and r in Rop is rs, while the
    product is sr in R.

order
    An order of an algebra is (roughly) a
    subalgebra that is also a full lattice.

Ore
    A left Ore domain is a (non-commutative)
    domain for which the set of non-zero
    elements satisfies the left Ore condition.
    A right Ore domain is defined similar.

perfect
    A left perfect ring is one satisfying the
    descending chain condition on right
    principal ideals. They are also
    characterized as rings whose flat left
    modules are all projective modules. Right
    perfect rings are defined analogously.
    Artinian rings are perfect.

polynomial
    1.  A polynomial ring over a commutative ring R is a commutative ring consisting of all the polynomials in the specified variables with coefficients in R.
    2.  A skew polynomial ring

    Given R a ring and an endomorphism
    {\displaystyle \sigma \in {\textrm
    {End}}(R)}\sigma \in {\textrm {End}}(R) of
    R. The skew polynomial ring {\displaystyle
    R[x;\sigma ]}R[x;\sigma ] is defined to be
    the set {\displaystyle
    \{a_{n}x^{n}+a_{n-1}x^{n-1}+\ldots
    +a_{1}x+a_{0}\mid n\in \mathbb {N}
    ,\,a_{n},a_{n-1},\ldots ,a_{1},a_{0}\in
    R\}}{\displaystyle
    \{a_{n}x^{n}+a_{n-1}x^{n-1}+\ldots
    +a_{1}x+a_{0}\mid n\in \mathbb {N}
    ,\,a_{n},a_{n-1},\ldots ,a_{1},a_{0}\in
    R\}}, with addition defined as usual, and
    multiplication defined by the relation
    {\displaystyle xa=\sigma (a)x\;\forall
    a\in R}xa=\sigma (a)x\;\forall a\in R.

prime
    1.  An element x of an integral domain is a prime element if it is not zero and not a unit and whenever x divides a product ab, x divides a or x divides b.
    2.  An ideal P in a commutative ring R is prime if P ≠ R and if for all a and b in R with ab in P, we have a in P or b in P. Every maximal ideal in a commutative ring is prime.
    3.  An ideal P in a (not necessarily commutative) ring R is prime if P ≠ R and for all ideals A and B of R, {\displaystyle AB\subseteq P}{\displaystyle AB\subseteq P} implies {\displaystyle A\subseteq P}{\displaystyle A\subseteq P} or {\displaystyle B\subseteq P}{\displaystyle B\subseteq P}. This extends the definition for commutative rings.
    4.  prime ring : A nonzero ring R is called a prime ring if for any two elements a and b of R with aRb = 0, we have either a = 0 or b = 0. This is equivalent to saying that the zero ideal is a prime ideal (in the noncommutative sense.) Every simple ring and every domain is a prime ring.

primitive
    1.  A left primitive ring is a ring that has a faithful simple left R-module. Every simple ring is primitive. Primitive rings are prime.
    2.  An ideal I of a ring R is said to be primitive if {\displaystyle R/I}R/I is primitive.

principal
    A principal ideal : A principal left ideal
    in a ring R is a left ideal of the form Ra
    for some element a of R. A principal right
    ideal is a right ideal of the form aR for
    some element a of R. A principal ideal is
    a two-sided ideal of the form RaR for some
    element a of R.

principal
    1.  A principal ideal domain is an integral domain in which every ideal is principal.
    2.  A principal ideal ring is a ring in which every ideal is principal.

quasi-Frobenius
    Types:
    - quasi-Frobenius ring
    - quotient ring or factor ring

quasi-Frobenius ring
    quasi-Frobenius

    A special type of Artinian ring which is
    also a self-injective ring on both sides.
    Every semisimple ring is quasi-Frobenius.

quotient ring
factor ring
    Given a ring R and an ideal I of R, the
    quotient ring is the ring formed by the
    set R/I of cosets {a + I : a∈R} together
    with the operations (a + I) + (b + I) = (a
    + b) + I and (a + I)(b + I) = ab + I. The
    relationship between ideals,
    homomorphisms, and factor rings is summed
    up in the fundamental theorem on
    homomorphisms.

radical
    The radical of an ideal I in a commutative
    ring consists of all those ring elements a
    power of which lies in I. It is equal to
    the intersection of all prime ideals
    containing I.

ring
    1.  A set R with two binary operations,
      usually called addition (+) and
      multiplication (×), such that R is an
      abelian group under addition, R is a
      monoid under multiplication, and
      multiplication is both left and right
      distributive over addition. Rings are
      assumed to have multiplicative
      identities unless otherwise noted. The
      additive identity is denoted by 0 and
      the multiplicative identity by 1.
      (Warning: some books, especially older
      books, use the term "ring" to mean what
      here will be called a rng; i.e., they do
      not require a ring to have a
      multiplicative identity.)
    2.  A ring homomorphism : A function f : R
      → S between rings (R, +, ∗) and (S, ⊕,
      ×) is a ring homomorphism if it
      satisfies
            f(a + b) = f(a) ⊕ f(b)
            f(a ∗ b) = f(a) × f(b)
            f(1) = 1
        for all elements a and b of R.
    3.  ring isomorphism : A ring homomorphism
      that is bijective is a ring isomorphism.
      The inverse of a ring isomorphism is
      also a ring isomorphism. Two rings are
      isomorphic if there exists a ring
      isomorphism between them. Isomorphic
      rings can be thought as essentially the
      same, only with different labels on the
      individual elements.

rng
    A rng of square zero: A rng in which xy =
    0 for all x and y. These are sometimes
    also called zero rings, even though they
    usually do not have a 1. The term "rng" is
    meant to suggest that it is a "ring"
    without an "identity".

self-injective
    A ring R is left self-injective if the
    module RR is an injective module. While
    rings with unity are always projective as
    modules, they are not always injective as
    modules.

semiperfect
    A semiperfect ring is a ring R such that,
    for the Jacobson radical {\displaystyle
    J(R)}J(R) of R, (1) {\displaystyle
    R/J(R)}{\displaystyle R/J(R)} is
    semisimple and (2) idempotents lift modulo
    {\displaystyle J(R)}J(R).

semiprimary
    A semiprimary ring is a ring R such that, for the Jacobson radical {\displaystyle J(R)}J(R) of R, (1) {\displaystyle R/J(R)}{\displaystyle R/J(R)} is semisimple and (2) {\displaystyle J(R)}J(R) is a nilpotent ideal.

semiprime
    1.  A semiprime ring is a ring where the
      only nilpotent ideal is the trivial
      ideal {\displaystyle \{0\}}\{0\}. A
      commutative ring is semiprime if and
      only if it is reduced.
    2.  An ideal I of a ring R is semiprime if
      for any ideal A of R, {\displaystyle
      A^{n}\subseteq I}{\displaystyle
      A^{n}\subseteq I} implies {\displaystyle
      A\subseteq I}{\displaystyle A\subseteq
      I}.  Equivalently, I is semiprime if and
      only if {\displaystyle R/I}R/I is a
      semiprime ring.

semiprimitive
    A semiprimitive ring or Jacobson
    semisimple ring is a ring whose Jacobson
    radical is zero. Von Neumann regular rings
    and primitive rings are semiprimitive,
    however quasi-Frobenius rings and local
    rings are usually not semiprimitive.

semiring
    A semiring : An algebraic structure
    satisfying the same properties as a ring,
    except that addition need only be an
    abelian monoid operation, rather than an
    abelian group operation. That is, elements
    in a semiring need not have additive
    inverses.

semisimple
    A semisimple ring is an Artinian ring R
    that is a finite product of simple
    Artinian rings; in other words, it is a
    semisimple left R-module.

separable
    A separable algebra is an associative
    algebra whose tensor-square admits a
    separability idempotent.

serial
    A right serial ring is a ring that is a
    right serial module over itself.

Severi–Brauer
    The Severi–Brauer variety is an algebraic
    variety associated to a given central
    simple algebra.

simple
    1.  A simple ring is a non-zero ring which
      only has trivial two-sided ideals (the
      zero ideal, the ring itself, and no
      more) is a simple ring.
    2.  A simple algebra is an associative
      algebra that is a simple ring.

subring
    A subring is a subset S of the ring
    (R,+,×) which remains a ring when + and ×
    are restricted to S and contains the
    multiplicative identity 1 of R.

symmetric algebra
    1.  The symmetric algebra of a vector
      space or a module V is the quotient of
      the tensor algebra of V by the ideal
      generated by elements of the form
      {\displaystyle x\otimes y-y\otimes
      x}{\displaystyle x\otimes y-y\otimes x}.
    2.  The graded-symmetric algebra of a
      vector space or a module V is a variant
      of the symmetric algebra that is
      constructed by taking grading into
      account.

Sylvester domain
    A Sylvester domain is a ring in which
    Sylvester's law of nullity holds.

tensor
    The tensor product algebra of associative
    algebras is the tensor product of the
    algebras as the modules with component
    multiplication

    The tensor algebra of a vector space or a
    module V is the direct sum of all tensor
    powers {\displaystyle V^{\otimes
    n}}V^{{\otimes n}} with the multiplication
    given by tensor product.

trivial
    1.  A trivial ideal is either the zero or
      the unit ideal.
    2.  The trivial ring or zero ring is the
      ring consisting of a single element 0 =
      1.

unit
    unit or invertible element : An element r
    of the ring R is a unit if there exists an
    element r−1 such that rr−1 = r−1r = 1.
    This element r−1 is uniquely determined by
    r and is called the multiplicative inverse
    of r. The set of units forms a group under
    multiplication.

unity
    The term "unity" is another name for the
    multiplicative identity.

unique
    A unique factorization domain or factorial
    ring is an integral domain R in which
    every non-zero non-unit element can be
    written as a product of prime elements of
    R.

uniserial
    A right uniserial ring is a ring that is a
    right uniserial module over itself. A
    commutative uniserial ring is also called
    a valuation ring.

von Neumann regular element
    1.  von Neumann regular element : An
      element r of a ring R is von Neumann
      regular if there exists an element x of
      R such that r = rxr.
    2.  A von Neumann regular ring: A ring for
      which each element a can be expressed as
      a = axa for another element x in the
      ring.  Semisimple rings are von Neumann
      regular.

zero
    A zero ring: The ring consisting only of a
    single element 0 = 1, also called the
    trivial ring. Sometimes "zero ring" is
    alternatively used to mean rng of square
    zero.
