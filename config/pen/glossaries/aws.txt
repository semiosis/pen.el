AppSync
AWS AppSync
    https://sammart.in/post/2020-05-17-querying-appsync-with-python/

    A really easy way to quickly assemble a
    GraphQL API to interact with data from
    DynamoDB, Lambda, ElasticSearch, RDS, or
    other HTTP endpoints.

    Enables you to use AWS Lambda to resolve
    any GraphQL field.
    
    For example, a GraphQL query might send a
    call to an Amazon RDS instance, and a
    GraphQL mutation might write to a Amazon
    Kinesis stream.
    
    In this section, we'll show you how to
    write a Lambda function that performs
    business logic based on the invocation of
    a GraphQL field operation.

ECS
Elastic Container Service
    Fully managed container orchestration
    service.
    
    Customers such as Duolingo, Samsung, GE,
    and Cookpad use ECS to run their most
    sensitive and mission critical
    applications because of its security,
    reliability, and scalability.
    
    ECS is a great choice to run containers
    for several reasons.
    
    First, you can choose to run your ECS
    clusters using AWS Fargate, which is
    serverless compute for containers.
    
    Fargate removes the need to provision and
    manage servers, lets you specify and pay
    for resources per application, and
    improves security through application
    isolation by design.
    
    Second, ECS is used extensively within
    Amazon to power services such as Amazon
    SageMaker, AWS Batch, Amazon Lex, and
    Amazon.com’s recommendation engine,
    ensuring ECS is tested extensively for
    security, reliability, and availability.

Reserved Instance
    A reservation of resources and capacity,
    for either one or three years, for a
    particular Availability Zone within a
    region.
    
    Unlike on-demand, when you purchase a
    reservation, you commit to paying for all
    of the hours of the 1- or 3-year term; in
    exchange, the hourly rate is lowered
    significantly.

Standard Reserved Instances
    Provide you with a significant discount
    (up to 75%) compared to On-Demand instance
    pricing, and can be purchased for a 1-year
    or 3-year term.
    
    Customers have the flexibility to change
    the Availability Zone, the instance size,
    and networking type of their Standard
    Reserved Instances.

Availability Zone
    A logical data center in a region
    available for use by any AWS customer.
    
    Each zone in a region has redundant and
    separate power, networking and
    connectivity to reduce the likelihood of
    two zones failing simultaneously.
    
    A common misconception is that a single
    zone equals a single data center.

DynamoDB
Amazon DynamoDB
    A key-value and document database that
    delivers single-digit millisecond
    performance at any scale.
    
    It's a fully managed, multiregion,

    [cloud formation]

    An AWS deploy tool on top of cloud
    formation.

    An open-source framework that you can use
    to build serverless applications on AWS.
    
    A serverless application is a combination
    of Lambda functions, event sources, and
    other resources that work together to
    perform tasks.
    
    Note that a serverless application is more
    than just a Lambda function—it can include
    additional resources such as APIs,
    databases, and event source mappings.

AWS Fargate
Fargate
    Amazon's container service.

    A serverless compute engine for containers
    that works with both Amazon Elastic
    Container Service (ECS) and Amazon Elastic
    k8s Service (EKS).
    
    Fargate makes it easy for you to focus on
    building your applications.
    
    Fargate removes the need to provision and
    manage servers, lets you specify and pay
    for resources per application, and
    improves security through application
    isolation by design.
    
    Fargate allocates the right amount of
    compute, eliminating the need to choose
    instances and scale cluster capacity.
    
    You only pay for the resources required to
    run your containers, so there is no over-
    provisioning and paying for additional
    servers.
    
    Fargate runs each task or pod in its own
    kernel providing the tasks and pods their
    own isolated compute environment.
    
    This enables your application to have
    workload isolation and improved security
    by design.
    
    This is why customers such as Vanguard,
    Accenture, Foursquare, and Ancestry have
    chosen to run their mission critical
    applications on Fargate.

CodeBuild
AWS CodeBuild
    Fully managed CI service that compiles
    source code, runs tests, and produces
    software packages that are ready to
    deploy.
    
    With CodeBuild, you don’t need to
    provision, manage, and scale your own
    build servers.
    
    CodeBuild scales continuously and
    processes multiple builds concurrently, so
    your builds are not left waiting in a
    queue.
    
    You can get started quickly by using
    prepackaged build environments, or you can
    create custom build environments that use
    your own build tools.
    
    With CodeBuild, you are charged by the
    minute for the compute resources you use.

CloudSearch

    or worry about hardware provisioning,
    setup, and maintenance.
    
    With a few clicks in the AWS Management
    Console, you can create a search domain
    and upload the data that you want to make
    searchable, and Amazon CloudSearch will
    automatically provision the required
    resources and deploy a highly tuned search
    index.
    
    You can easily change your search
    parameters, fine tune search relevance,
    and apply new settings at any time.
    
    As your volume of data and traffic
    fluctuates, Amazon CloudSearch seamlessly
    scales to meet your needs.

        Command Query Responsibility
        Segregation is a pattern for
        implementing distributed systems.
        
        It divides the application into two
        logical parts: the command side and
        the query side.
        
        The command side is responsible for
        changing the state of the application,
        while the query side is responsible
        for reporting the state of the
        application.

AWS Outposts

        A service choreography is a model of a
        service that is used to describe the
        capabilities of the service and the
        interactions that are possible with
        the service.
        
        A decoupled service choreography is a
        service choreography where the service
        and the consumer of the service are
        not tightly coupled.
