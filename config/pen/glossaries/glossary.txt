An algebra
    A set of values + a set of operators that
    those values are closed under and some
    laws it must obey.

discrete time
    Views values of variables as occurring at
    distinct, separate "points in time", or
    equivalently as being unchanged throughout
    each non-zero region of time ("time
    period")—that is, time is viewed as a
    discrete variable.

    strategy where the arguments to a function
    are not immediately evaluated. Wikipedia

Lexical context
    In languages with lexical scope (also
    called static scope), name resolution
    depends on the location in the source code
    and the lexical context, which is defined
    by where the named variable or function is
    defined.

Catenation
    This is what the word concatenation
    derives from, and the unix command 'cat'.

    The bonding of atoms of the same element
    into a series, called a chain.

vector space
    [#linear algebra]

    A space consisting of vectors, together
    with the associative and commutative
    operation of addition of vectors, and the
    associative and distributive operation of
    multiplication of vectors by scalars.

inner product
    [#linear algebra]

    Associates each pair of vectors in the
    vector space with a scalar quantity known
    as the inner product of the vectors.

inner product space
    [#linear algebra]
    [vector space]

    Has an additional structure called an
    inner product.

Cosine similarity
    A measure of similarity between two non-
    zero vectors of an inner product space
    that measures the cosine of the angle
    between them.

    The cosine of 0° is 1, and it is less than
    1 for any angle in the interval 0, π]
    radians.

Euclidean norm
L2 norm

Euclidean distance
Euclidean metric
Pythagorean metric
    Bee-line.

    The "ordinary" straight-line distance
    between two points in Euclidean space.

    With this distance, Euclidean space
    becomes a metric space.

    The associated norm is called L2 norm.

Riffle
    The fancy shuffle thing.

    You need 7 of them to fully shuffle the deck.

Actor model
    [#computer science]
    [#erlang]

    A mathematical model of concurrent
    computation.

    Treats "actors" as the universal
    primitives of concurrent computation.

    Defines some general rules for how the
    system's components should behave and
    interact with each other.

    The most famous language that uses this
    model is probably Erlang.

Synchronicity
    Coincidence but not coincidence.

    But it's not a word which means nothing.
    If it exists because of the human
    condition then it should be recognised as
    a thing.

Axiom
Postulate
    A statement that is taken to be true, to
    serve as a premise or starting point for
    further reasoning and arguments. The word
    comes from the Greek axíōma (ἀξίωμα) 'that
    which is thought worthy or fit' or 'that
    which commends itself as evident.'

Euclid's 5th postulate
    Two lines converge within the area to the
    side of a 3rd intersecting line where the
    sum of their interior angles is less than
    180 degrees.

    or.

    If a straight line falling on two straight
    lines makes the interior angles on the
    same side of it taken together less than
    two right angles, then the two straight
    lines, if produced indefinitely, meet on
    that side on which the sum of angles is
    less than two right angles.

Aragoscope
    A type of space telescope that uses
    diffraction to advantage, rather than a
    impediment.

Aragospot
    [[https://youtu.be/5RacK2VwqEk?t=134][Making an Aragoscope - YouTube]]

    Proof that photons do not travel like
    particles, they travel sort of like waves,
    and waves can curve around an object.

    It's actually the lense of the light
    source. You can add a cross in front of
    the light source and you will see this in
    the aragospot.

    Use a larger disk (than a coin to blot out
    the light) and you get more resolution.
    Cody uses a jar lid. You don't have to
    move the disk further away, only increase
    the diameter of the disk, but you have to
    move further back until you get an
    eclipse-like halo.

    Cody could use a metal lid as a lense to
    read "Cody's Lab" written on a torch very
    far away.

Orbiting rainbow
    [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIASPc89Sgk][The Future of Space Telescopes | Space Time - YouTube]]

diffraction limit
    The finest detail a light telescope can
    give us is with a diffraction limit, which
    increases with wavelength.

    So infrared has a disadvantage over
    visible or ultaviolet light.

    However, the diffraction limit gets
    smaller with increasing aperture size.

    What the James Webb Telescope loses due to
    concentrating on the infrared, it makes up
    for through sheer size.

proton
    A swarm of partons (little particles)
        [[https://youtu.be/6Waurx8e-1o?t=768][Leonard Susskind: My friend Richard Feynman - YouTube]]

        Because they are moving really fast,
        the internal motions are very slow!
            Amazing intuition!

        When the electron hits the proton, you
        see a frozen bunch of partons (a
        snapshot of the proton).

        This means you get to think of the
        system as frozen partons.

Getafix
    Auto-fix technology from Facebook.

    Applies hierarchical clustering to many
    thousands of past code changes that human
    engineers made, looking at both the change
    itself and also the context around the
    code change.
        Allows it to detect the underlying
        patterns in bugs and the corresponding
        fixes that previous auto-fix tools
        couldn't.

    Learns to fix patterns from past code
    changes.

    Because Getafix learns from past code
    changes, it also produces fixes that are
    easy for human engineers to understand.

    Uses
    - Clustering algorithm.

      particular lines of problematic code to
      find more appropriate fixes.

    Predictions become less accurate as time
    passes.

    concept
        Relates to the target variable (the

        It can also refer to other phenomena
        of interest besides the target
        concept, such as an input, but, in the
        context of concept drift, the term
        commonly refers to the target

Homomorphic encryption
    A form of encryption that allows
    computation on ciphertexts, generating an
    encrypted result which, when decrypted,
    matches the result of the operations as if
    they had been performed on the plaintext.

Probabilistic Polynomial-Time Algorithm
PPTA

Semantic Security
    A semantically secure cryptosystem is one
    where only negligible information about
    the plaintext can be feasibly extracted
    from the ciphertext.

    In line with "computational complexity analogue to Perfect Secrecy".

    In contrast to "Perfect Secracy".

Perfect Secrecy
    [concept]

    Given an encrypted message (or ciphertext)
    from a perfectly secure encryption system
    (or cipher), absolutely nothing will be
    revealed about the unencrypted message (or
    plaintext) by the ciphertext.

    Shannon theorem of perfect secrecy
        For a perfect encryption scheme, the
        number of keys is at least the size of the
        message space (number of messages that
        have a non-zero probability).

computational complexity analogue to Perfect Secrecy
    Cannot determine any partial information
    on the message with probability
    non-negligibly higher than all other
    PPTA's that only have access to the
    message length (and not the ciphertext).

Perfect Secracy
    The ciphertext reveals no information at
    all about the plaintext.

    In contrast to "Semantic Secracy".

Homomorphic encryption
    A form of encryption that allows
    computation on ciphertexts, generating an
    encrypted result which, when decrypted,
    matches the result of the operations as if
    they had been performed on the plaintext.
    The purpose of homomorphic encryption is
    to allow computation on encrypted data.

    Quantum properties
        Superposition [of spins]
        Entanglement
        Interferance
            Noise-cancelling headphones create
            interferance.

            Two types:
                Constructive
                Destructive

        We can exploit superposition in a quantum
        computer, but we can also use other
        properties, such as entanglement, or
        even interferance.

Cosine similarity
    The best way to compute similarity in
    collaborative filtering.

    It takes into account ratings.

    Treat unknown values (movies not watched)
    as 0.

    The problem with cosine similarity is it
    treats the missing ratings as negative
    ratings.

Centered cosine similarity
    Normalise the ratings of each user so that
    the sum of the ratings is 0.

    To do this, subtract the row mean from each value.

Thermodynamic Entropy

    Monoids are more interesting.
    More applicable to helping us to write
    better code, especially in a parallel
    system.

    - break it up into small tasks,
    - spread that out to different workers.
      These are on different threads or in
      different machines.
    - Here’s the key. The monoid lets you put
      them back together

associative operation
    Has 2 arguments. It's binary.
    It takes 2 values of the same type and
    returns a value of the same type.

gamma function
    Γ(x) = (x-1)!

    The gamma function is kind-of equal to the
    factorial function.

Hierarchical feature detection
    Visual object classification is a type of
    application where this is very effective.

Neural Network
    Typically, the training cannot determine
    the architecture.

convNet
    Insight:
    In a convNet there are many more
    things to set, because layers are not
    fully connected.

    For each convolutional layer, the user
    must specify:
    - Number of filters
    - Size of the filters
    - The step size:
      How a given filter is shifted over
      the image map.
    - The padding:
      Whether filters extend beyond the
      edge of the image.

    For each pooling layer, the user must
    specify:
    - The size of the pooling window:
      The subsampling ratio.
    - The type of pooling:
      Max or average.

    Problems
    - Throws away location information.
      The order of features might be
      ignored. This makes them easy to fool.
    - Perform well only when test data is
      similar to training data, resulting in
      huge training set requirement.

Chaos
Deterministic Chaos
    When the present determines the future,
    but the approximate present does not
    approximately determine the future.

    Events that never repeat and vastly impact
    the outcome un unpredictable.

    An interdisciplinary theory.
    It states:
        Within the apparent randomness of
        chaotic complex systems, there are
        underlying patterns, constant feedback
        loops, repetition, self-similarity,
        fractals, self-organization, and
        reliance on programming at the initial
        point known as sensitive dependence on
        initial conditions.

    Chaotic behavior exists in many natural
    systems, such as weather and climate.

Tenacious
    retentive, recollective, long, tenacious.

    dogged, dour, persistent, pertinacious,
    tenacious, unyielding.

    language.

    In lambda calculus, everything is an
    anonymous (i.e. nameless wink) function.

    The lambda-calculus is a minimal
    programming language.

meta-algorithm
metaheuristic
    A higher-level procedure or heuristic
    designed to find, generate, or select a
    heuristic that may provide a sufficiently
    good solution to an optimization problem,
    especially with incomplete or imperfect
    information.

    Use multiple learning algorithms to obtain
    better predictive performance than could
    be obtained from any of the constituent
    learning algorithms alone.

Weak learner

Hedge fund
    An investment fund that pools capital from
    accredited individuals or institutional
    investors and invests in a variety of
    assets, often with complex
    portfolio-construction and risk-management
    techniques.

Static analysis
Static code analysis
    A method of computer program debugging
    that is done by examining the code without
    executing the program. The process
    provides an understanding of the code
    structure, and can help to ensure that the
    code adheres to industry standards.

poll
"wait for"
    He process where the computer or
    controlling device waits for an external
    device to check for its readiness or
    state, often with low-level hardware.

    'poll' the operation [until it completes].

rope
    [data structure]

    Efficient for storing and manipulating
    very large mutable strings.

    Reduces memory reallocation and data copy
    overhead for applications that are
    constantly operating on very large strings
    by splitting them into multiple smaller
    strings transparently.

    Efficient random access is achieved via a
    binary tree.

Lexical scope
Static scope
    A lexically scoped language means that
    whenever an identifier is used as an
    expression, something in the textual
    environment of the expression determines
    the identifier’s binding.

    A convention used with many programming
    languages that sets the scope (range of
    functionality) of a variable so that it
    may only be called (referenced) from
    within the block of code in which it is
    defined. The scope is determined when the
    code is compiled.

System programming
Systems programming
    The primary distinguishing characteristic
    of systems programming when compared to
    application programming is that
    application programming aims to produce
    software which provides services to the
    user directly (e.g. word processor),
    whereas systems programming aims to
    produce software and software platforms
    which provide services to other software,
    are performance constrained, or both (e.g.
    operating systems, computational science
    applications, game engines and AAA video
    games, industrial automation, and software
    as a service applications).

[quantum] spin (of an electron)
    Is as intrinsic as mass and charge.

    Quatnum spin produces a dipole magnetic
    field.
        Like a magnet with 2 ends. It has
        magnetic field lines.

Natural languages
    The languages people speak, such as
    English, Spanish, and French. They were
    not designed by people (although people
    try to impose some order on them); they
    evolved naturally.

Formal languages
    Languages that are designed by people for
    specific applications. For example, the
    notation that mathematicians use is a
    formal language that is particularly good
    at denoting relationships among numbers
    and symbols. Chemists use a formal
    language to represent the chemical
    structure of molecules.

    - strict syntax [rules]

Formal system
    Defined by a finite set of symbols and a
    some rules of inference.  A group of
    symbols arranged in an order of some sort
    is called a string. There are some strings
    in the formal system which are known as
    axioms. The rules of inference show us a
    way of creating or generating theorems
    from these base axioms.

Turing tarpit
    A language that aims for
    Turing-completeness in an arbitrarily
    small number of linguistic elements -
    ideally, as few as possible.

Currying
    Making a new function from ‘f’ by filling
    in some of ‘f’s arguments and allowing the
    rest to be provided later.

    An example of a higher order function.

    Currying is this whole "Functions that
    returns functions" scheme.

    So, when you f(x)(y) you are actually
    passing down 'y' to the 'f(x)' function.

    All functions in haskell take only one
    argument.

    foldl takes an argument and returns a
    function.

trampolining

lexer
    A sequence of rules; each rule is a
    trigger and an action.

    (lexer [trigger action] ...)

    Remember, ... in racket is a kleene plus.

    Lexers in Racket are unusually powerful
    because the regular expressions used to
    describe classes of tokens may use
    non-standard regular operators like
    difference, complement and intersection.

regular operator
    An operator that a regular expression
    uses.

Linear Congruential [Pseudorandom Number] Generator
Linear Congruential Generator
LCG
    Pseudorandom number generator algorithm.

    An algorithm that yields a sequence of
    pseudo-randomized numbers calculated with
    a discontinuous piecewise linear equation.
    The method represents one of the oldest
    and best-known pseudorandom number
    generator algorithms.

NP-complete
    While it is easy to confirm whether a
    proposed solution is valid, it may
    inherently be prohibitively difficult to
    determine in the first place whether any
    solution exists.

Subset sum problem
    An important problem in complexity theory
    and cryptography.

    Given a set (or multiset) of integers, is
    there a non-empty subset whose sum is
    zero?

    Example,
        Given the set {−7, −3, −2, 5, 8}, the
        answer is yes because the subset {−3,
        −2, 5} sums to zero.

        The problem is NP-complete.

    An equivalent problem is this:
        Given a set of integers and an integer
        s, does any non-empty subset sum to s?

    Subset sum can also be thought of as:
        A special case of the knapsack
        problem.

        One interesting special case of subset
        sum is the partition problem, in which
        s is half of the sum of all elements
        in the set.

monotonic function
    A function between ordered sets that
    preserves or reverses the given order.

    If it is either entirely non-increasing,
    or entirely non-decreasing.

superincreasing sequence
    A sequence of positive real numbers is
    called superincreasing if every element of
    the sequence is greater than the sum of
    all previous elements in the sequence.

monotonically increasing function vs superincreasing sequence
    In superincreasing the elements are
    greater than the SUM of previous elements.

    In a monotonically increasing function,
    the elements are greater than only the
    previous element.

PKCS #1

Chinese remainder theorm
    A theorem of number theory.

    If one knows the remainders of the
    Euclidean division of an integer n by
    several integers, then one can determine
    uniquely the remainder of the division of
    n by the product of these integers, under
    the condition that the divisors are
    pairwise coprime.

    Discovered 3rd century AD by the Chinese
    mathematician Sunzi in Sunzi Suanjing.

    Widely used for computing with large
    integers.

    Allows replacing a computation for which
    one knows a bound on the size of the
    result by several similar computations on
    small integers.

    The Chinese remainder theorem (expressed
    in terms of congruences) is true over
    every principal ideal domain.

    It has been generalized to any commutative
    ring, with a formulation involving ideals.

Birthday Paradox
Birthday problem
    In a set of n randomly chosen people, some
    pair of them will have the same birthday.

    By the pigeonhole principle, the
    probability reaches 100% when the number
    of people reaches 367 (since there are
    only 366 possible birthdays, including
    February 29).

    However, 99.9% probability is reached with
    just 70 people, and 50% probability with
    23 people.

    These conclusions are based on the
    assumption that each day of the year
    (excluding February 29) is equally
    probable for a birthday.

    Real-world applications for the birthday
    paradox include a cryptographic attack
    called the birthday attack.

Birthday attack
    Uses the probabilistic model of the
    birthday problem to reduce the complexity
    of finding a collision for a hash
    function.

Expressive language

Operational semantics
    A category of formal programming language
    semantics in which certain desired
    properties of a program, such as
    correctness, safety or security, are
    verified by constructing proofs from
    logical statements about its execution and
    procedures, rather than by attaching
    mathematical meanings to its terms
    (denotational semantics).

Reduction semantics

    semantics using so-called reduction
    contexts.

    A technique for formalizing an equational
    theory for control and state.

Cryptanalysis
    The study of analyzing information systems
    in order to study the hidden aspects of
    the systems.

functional programming
    Avoids changing-state and mutable data.

    No state and mutation.

    There are times where the
    functional-programming approach doesn’t
    fit, especially with functions that are
    used for their side effects—for instance,
    println. So the rule of thumb in Racket is
    to use functional programming when you
    can, and depart from it when you must.

    I would argue to keep it separate anyway.

Functional parser

parser combinator
    A higher-order function that accepts

Theorem
    [#Gödel's incompleteness theorem]

    It's not an obstacle to AI.

    ewwlinks +/"A theorem is any string" "https://www.sdsc.edu/~jeff/Godel_vs_AI.html"

    Any string which can be can be derived
    from the axiom(s) by applying zero or more
    of the rules of inference in succession to
    the axiom(s).

Consistency
    Consistency in a formal system means that
    every theorem [of the formal system], upon
    interpretation, comes out true (in some
    imaginable world).

Complete
    A formal system is complete if for every
    statement of the formal system, either the
    statement or its negation can be derived
    (i.e., proved) in the system. Hence a
    formal system is consistent if there is no
    statement such that the statement itself
    and its negation are both derivable in the
    system.

Godel's Incompleteness theorem
    All consistent axiomatic formulations of
    number theory include undecidable
    propositions.

    In simpler mathematical terms, any
    consistent formal system which can do even
    simple arithmetic is incomplete meaning
    there are true statements in the realm of
    number theory which can not be derived
    from the axioms of the formal system. This
    means that some statements even if they
    are true are not theorems of the formal
    system.

    or computational objects, such as
    functions or data types, are defined in

    God for help with a problem

    Someone who begs earnestly for something
    he or she wants.

    A younger brother entreating his sister to
    be allowed in her tree house could be
    described as a supplicant.

    An entity at one end of a point-to-point
    LAN segment that seeks to be authenticated
    by an authenticator attached to the other
    end of that link. The IEEE 802.1X standard
    uses the term "supplicant" to refer either
    to hardware or to software.

binary safe
    A binary-safe function is one that treats
    its input as a raw stream of bytes and
    ignores every textual aspect it may have.

    exec < <(p "$input") # binary safe
    exec < <(cat <<< "$input") # xxd -p <<< "foo" # not binary safe (appends newline)
    cat t.txt | xxd -p # 0a0a0a0a0a
    xxd -p <<< "$(cat t.txt)" # 0a # It appears <<< strips all remaining whitespace from the variable and enforces a single newline

Bernoulli random variable
Boolean random variable
    May describe the event that __ has cancer.

Probabilistic inference
    The task of deriving the probability of
    one or more random variables taking a
    specific value or set of values.

    For example, a Bernoulli (Boolean) random
    variable may describe the event that John
    has cancer.
        Such a variable could take a value of
        1 (John has cancer) or 0 (John does
        not have cancer).

    DeepDive uses probabilistic inference to
    estimate the probability that the random
    variable takes value 1:
        a probability of 0.78 would mean that
        John is 78% likely to have cancer.

    [#quantum mechanics]
    [operator]

    The total energy of the system in most of
    the cases.

    Example:
        Total energy of a particle.

    Its spectrum is the set of possible
    outcomes when one measures the total
    energy of a system.

quasiparticle
    A group of particles that behave as if
    they’re one because their parts are
    interacting somehow.

superfluid
    Frictionless superconductor.

dogfooding
    When an organization uses its own product.

    Similar to "taste of your own medicine",
    except, if we're being precise, the latter
    is a bad thing where dogfooding is a good
    thing.

PascalCase
    Words created by concatenating capitalized
    words. An example is this page's title,
    PascalCase. Sometimes called
    "UpperCamelCase", or "DromedaryCase".
    Distinguished from CamelCase by the
    restriction that the first letter must be
    upper case. ("camelCase" isn't PascalCase,
    but "PascalCase" is.)

Concrete type
    Not an interfacea.

    Interface types provide contracts to
    concrete types.

    When you implement interface types into
    concrete types, you don’t need to
    explicitly declare the interface type
    along with your struct definition.
    Instead, it will implicitly implement the
    interface types into your types at run
    time.

power set [of S]
    The set of all subsets of S.

DFA
Deterministic Finite Automatons

NFA
Nondeterministic Finite Automatons
    vimhelp NFA

NFA vs DFA
    They have exactly the same capabilities
    and limitations. The only difference is
    notational convenience.

SOLID
    Five guidelines for object-oriented
    computer programming.

    Improves:
    - understandability
    - flexiblility
    - maintainability

Dependency Inversion Principle
    High-level modules, which provide complex
    logic, should be easily reusable and
    unaffected by changes in low-level
    modules, which provide utility features.

LSP
Liskov Substitution Principle
    A concept in Object Oriented Programming
    that states:

    Functions that use pointers or references
    to base classes must be able to use
    objects of derived classes without knowing
    it.

Sphere Indexing
    http://donw.io/post/sphere-indexing/

Population inversion
    From statistical mechanics.

    Occurs while a system (such as a group of
    atoms or molecules) exists in a state in
    which more members of the system are in
    higher, excited states than in lower,
    unexcited energy states.

    It is called an "inversion" because in
    many familiar and commonly encountered
    physical systems, this is not possible.

    The concept is of fundamental importance
    in laser science because the production of
    a population inversion is a necessary step
    in the workings of a standard laser.

Cardinality
The degree of relationship
    The number of occurrences in one entity
    which are associated (or linked) to the
    number of occurrences in another.

    There are three degrees of relationship,
    known as:
        one-to-one (1:1)
        one-to-many (1:M)
        many-to-many (M:N)

a priori
priori
a posteriori
posteriori
    "a priori" means 'from the earlier'.

    "a posteriori" means 'from the later'.

    A priori and a posteriori are Latin
    phrases used in philosophy to distinguish
    types of knowledge, justification, or
    argument by their reliance on empirical
    evidence or experience.
    
    a priori:
        A priori knowledge is independent from
        current experience.
        
        Examples include mathematics,
        tautologies, and deduction from pure
        reason.

Nautical twilight
    The second twilight phase. Both the
    horizon and the brighter stars are usually
    visible at this time, making it possible
    to navigate at sea.

    During nautical twilight, both the horizon
    and the brighter stars are usually
    visible.

AlphaZero
    Can crack any perfect-information game.

Rayleigh-Taylor instability
    An 'instability'.

    In an inverted cup of water, air pressure
    provides a force perpendicular to the
    water surface which means that around the
    ripples we no longer have a force pointing
    straight up.

    Even the tiniest of ripples may grow to
    the point where the water completely
    changes shape and it eventually deforms
    its way out of the glass.

Generative Model
    A powerful way of learning any kind of
    data distribution using unsupervised
    learning.

    All types of generative models aim at
    learning the true data distribution of the
    training set so as to generate new data
    points with some variations.

    I think it's just a more ambitious version
    of distriminative.

    Once you have a generative model, you get
    classification for free.

Approaches of statistical classification
    Two main approaches
    - Generative approach
    - Discriminative approach

    The classifiers are computed by different
    approaches. The approaches differ in the
    degree of statistical modeling.

Last universal common ancestor
LUCA
Last universal ancestor
LUA
cenancestor
(incorrectly) progenote
    The most recent population of organisms
    from which all organisms now living on
    Earth have a common descent. LUCA is the
    most recent common ancestor of all current
    life on Earth.

Progenote
    A hypothetical simple biological entity or
    organized system of a kind that could have
    included the evolutionary common ancestor
    of eukaryotes and prokaryotes.

Symmetry
    The idea that one aspect of a system can
    change while another remains constant.

    The idea of natural laws themselves, rely
    on the forms of symmetry that mean the
    same forces will apply to you as they do
    to me, independently of our position in
    space or time.

Annealing
    A heat treatment that alters the physical
    and sometimes chemical properties of a
    material to increase its ductility and
    reduce its hardness, making it more
    workable.

    Over time, finds rest / stabilises at a
    lower energy state.

Allegory
    A story, poem, or picture that can be
    interpreted to reveal a hidden meaning,
    typically a moral or political one.

posterior inference

Posterior probability distribution
    The probability distribution of an unknown
    quantity, treated as a random variable,
    conditional on the evidence obtained from
    an experiment or survey.

posterior probability
    [of a random event]
    [of an uncertain proposition]

    The conditional probability that is
    assigned after the relevant evidence or
    background is taken into account.

    "Posterior", in this context, means after
    taking into account the relevant evidence
    related to the particular case being
    examined.

    For instance, there is a ("non-posterior")
    probability of a person finding buried
    treasure if they dig in a random spot, and
    a posterior probability of finding buried
    treasure if they dig in a spot where their
    metal detector rings.

RISC-V
    An open-source hardware instruction set
    architecture based on established reduced
    instruction set computer principles.

Roko's Basilisk
    It's meant to be a terrifying thought
    experiment, but I really don't find it to
    be so.

transitive dependency
    A functional dependency which holds by
    virtue of transitivity.

    This is what I imagine it to be. Dependecy
    by proxy.

    Can occur only in a relation that has
    three or more attributes. Let A, B, and C
    designate three distinct attributes (or
    distinct collections of attributes) in the
    relation. Suppose all three of the
    following conditions hold:

    A → B
    It is not the case that B → A
    B → C

    Then the functional dependency A → C
    (which follows from 1 and 3 by the axiom
    of transitivity) is a transitive
    dependency.

Connected Components
    A hard clustering algorithm which finds
    clusters/islands in related/connected
    data.

    As a concrete example:
    Say you have data about roads joining any
    two cities in the world, and you need to
    find out all the continents in the world
    and which city they contain.

Celtic Blessing (Anon.)
    May peace guard
    The door of your house
    The door of your heart
    May the road rise to meet you,
    And the sun stand at your shoulder
    May the wind be always at your back
    And the rains fall softly upon your fields
    May life itself befriend you

anti-de Sitter space
    A toy universe.

    Physicists’ theoretical playground of
    choice.

    Works like a hologram.

    The bendy fabric of space-time in the
    interior of the universe is a projection
    that emerges from entangled quantum
    particles living on its outer boundary.

    This holographic "emergence" of space-time
    works just like a quantum error-correcting
    code.

Quantum Error Correction
    Explains how space-time achieves its
    "intrinsic robustness," despite being
    woven out of fragile quantum stuff.

    The language of quantum error correction
    is also starting to enable researchers to
    probe the mysteries of black holes.

Black hole
    Spherical regions in which space-time
    curves so steeply inward toward the center
    that not even light can escape.

    "Everything traces back to black holes,"
    said Almheiri, who is now at the Institute
    for Advanced Study in Princeton, New
    Jersey. These paradox-ridden places are
    where gravity reaches its zenith and
    Einstein's general relativity theory
    fails. "There are some indications that if
    you understand which code space-time
    implements," he said, "it might help us in
    understanding the black hole interior."

regimen
    A prescribed course of medical treatment,
    diet, or exercise for the promotion or
    restoration of health.

Galileo Galilei

    individual trees, shrubs, vines, and other
    perennial woody plants in dendrology and
    horticulture.

    Examples:
        XPath
        XQuery

smoking gun
    An object or fact that serves as
    conclusive evidence of a crime or similar
    act, just short of being caught in
    flagrante delicto. "Smoking gun" refers to
    the strongest kind of circumstantial
    evidence, as opposed to direct evidence.
    Direct evidence would include the entire
    action: Pulling the trigger, firing the
    gun, and the victim falling.

    Evil can only be 'disguised' if we do not
    know what we are looking for.

provisioning
    The process of preparing and equipping a
    network to allow it to provide new
    services to its users

    CIO typically manages provisioning.

    - Give users access to data repositories
      or grant authorization to systems,
      network applications and databases based
      on a unique user identity.
    - Appropriate for their use hardware
      resources, such as computers, mobile
      phones and pagers.

Flow control

    transmission between two nodes to prevent
    a fast sender from overwhelming a slow
    receiver.

    Not to be confused with control flow.

Feature set
    The set of all the attributes that you're
    interested in.

Forward selection
    An approach to feature selection, which is
    a type of dimensionality reduction.

    - Efficient for choosing a small subset of
      the features.
    - Misses features whose usefulness
      requires other features (feature
      synergy) .

Backward elimination
    An approach to feature selection, which is
    a type of dimensionality reduction.

    - Efficient for discarding a small subset
      of the features.
    - Preserves features whose usefulness
      requires other features.

hill-climbing
hill-climbing search
    [optimization technique]
    [iterative algorithm]

    Finding the maximum of a function.

    Belongs to the family of local search.

    Starts with an arbitrary solution to a
    problem, then attempts to find a better
    solution by making an incremental change
    to the solution.

    If the change produces a better solution,
    another incremental change is made to the
    new solution, and so on until no further
    improvements can be found.

    For example, hill climbing can be applied
    to the travelling salesman problem.

    It is easy to find an initial solution
    that visits all the cities but will likely
    be very poor compared to the optimal
    solution.

    The algorithm starts with such a solution
    and makes small improvements to it, such
    as switching the order in which two cities
    are visited.

    Eventually, a much shorter route is likely
    to be obtained.

Forward selection vs. backward elimination
    http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~dpage/cs760/DimensionalityReduction.pdf

    Both use a hill-climbing search.

Feature selection
    Equivalent to projecting feature space to
    a lower dimensional subspace perpendicular
    to removed feature

Dimensionality reduction
Generalisation (loosely)
    A broader class of projections including:
    + feature selection
      - forward selection
      - backward elemination
    + PCA

    PCA re-represents data using linear
    combinations of original features, so it's
    not a feature selection technique, but IS
    a technique used to perform dimensionality
    reduction.

    Examples:
    + t-SNE
    + PCA
    + LSA
    + SVD
    + LDA

Sequence-to-sequence processing
Neural machine translation
    An encoder/decoder approach.

gimbal
    A pivoted support that allows the rotation
    of an object about a single axis.

Gimbal lock
    The loss of one degree of freedom in a
    three-dimensional, three-gimbal mechanism
    that occurs when the axes of two of the
    three gimbals are driven into a parallel
    configuration, "locking" the system into
    rotation in a degenerate two-dimensional
    space.

    The word lock is misleading: no gimbal is
    restrained.

fermion
    could be either
    - an elementary particles
      such as an electron
    - a composite particle
      such as a proton

Spin-statistics theorem
    [#any reasonable relativistic quantum
    field theory]

    - particles with integer spin are bosons,
    - particles with half-integer spin are
      fermions.

Referential transparency
    A property of a function.

    The function will always give the same
    result for a set of parameters no matter
    when it is called.

Pure functions
    Thread safety
        A pure function with value parameters
        is completely thread safe.
    Reusability
        It is much easier to transplant a pure
        function to a new environment.

        How many times have you known there
        was some code that does what you need
        in another system, but extricating it
        from all of its environmental
        assumptions was more work than just
        writing it over?
    Testability
        Referential transparency

multivariate data

anomaly detection
outlier detection
    [#data mining]

    The identification of rare items, events
    or observations which raise suspicions by
    differing significantly from the majority
    of the data.

Unsupervised anomaly detection
    Detect anomalies in an unlabeled test data
    set under the assumption that the majority
    of the instances in the data set are
    normal by looking for instances that seem
    to fit least to the remainder of the data
    set.

Supervised anomaly detection
    Require a data set that has been labeled
    as "normal" and "abnormal" and involves
    training a classifier.

Semi-supervised anomaly detection
    Construct a model representing normal
    behavior from a given normal training data
    set, and then test the likelihood of a
    test instance to be generated by the
    learnt model.

random sampling
    [basic sampling technique]

    We select a group of subjects (a sample)
    for study from a larger group (a
    population).

    Each individual is chosen entirely by
    chance and each member of the population
    has an equal chance of being included in
    the sample.

Monte Carlo Tree Search
MCTS
    [heuristic tree search algorithm]

    Application
        Some kinds of decision processes, most
        notably those employed in game play.

    Focus
        The analysis of the most promising
        moves, expanding the search tree based
        on random sampling of the search
        space.

    Essence
        Bias the choice of child nodes,
        letting the game tree expand towards
        the most promising moves.

    Each round consists of 4 steps:
    + Selection

      - Start from root R
      - elect successive child nodes until a
        leaf node L is reached.

      The root is the current game state and a
      leaf is any node from which no
      simulation (playout) has yet been
      initiated.

    + Expansion

      Unless L ends the game decisively (e.g.
      win/loss/draw) for either player, create
      one (or more) child nodes and choose
      node C from one of them.

      Child nodes are any valid moves from the
      game position defined by L.

    + Simulation

      Complete one random playout from node C.

      This step is sometimes also called
      playout or rollout.

      A playout may be as simple as choosing
      uniform random moves until the game is
      decided (for example in chess, the game
      is won, lost, or drawn).

    + Backpropagation

      Use the result of the playout to update
      information in the nodes on the path
      from C to R.

      optimization, important in operations
      research and theoretical computer
      science.

Hopfield Network
    Can solve the Travelling Salesman Problem.

false dichotomy
false dilemma
    A type of informal fallacy in which
    something is falsely claimed to be an
    "either/or" situation, when in fact there
    is at least one additional option. A false
    dilemma can arise intentionally, when a
    fallacy is used in an attempt to force a
    choice or outcome.

    A dichotomy that is not jointly exhaustive
    (there are other alternatives), or that is
    not mutually exclusive (the alternatives
    overlap), or that is possibly neither.

    The presentation of two opposing
    conditions or views that do not properly
    represent all options.

Objective Function
    Measures how well the model fit the
    training data.

    Consists of 2 parts:
    - Training Loss
    - Regularization

Model fitting
    The essence of machine learning.

    A measure of how well a machine learning
    model generalizes to similar data to that
    on which it was trained.

    A model that is well-fitted produces more
    accurate outcomes, a model that is
    overfitted matches the data too closely,
    and a model that is underfitted doesn't
    match closely enough.

    Examples
        Fit a neural language model with a
        learned embedding and an LSTM hidden
        layer.

Word-level Neural Language Model

Word-level Prediction

Word-level networks
    [type of neural network]

    Each word in the sentence is translated
    into a set of numbers before being fed
    into the neural network.

    These numbers change over time while the
    neural net trains itself, encoding unique
    properties such as the semantics and
    contextual information for each word.

Optimal Substructure
    Property of a problem.

    If it can be solved optimally by breaking
    it into sub-problems and then recursively
    finding the optimal solutions to the
    sub-problems, then it is said to have
    optimal substructure.

Auto-regressive Network
    DeepMind seems to be enamored with this.

    Examples
    - WaveNet
    - PixelRNN
    - PixelCNN
    - ByteNet

    Radical departure from more traditional
    CNN networks and has remarkably different
    behaviour.

    Type of Generative Network.

    Beauty
    - The same formulation applies to one
      dimensional, two dimensional and higher
      dimensional domains:

Crenelations
    The solid widths between the crenels are
    called merlons. A wall with battlements is
    said to be crenelated or embattled.
    Battlements on walls have protected
    walkways    (chemin de ronde) behind them.
    On tower or building tops, the (often
    flat) roof is    used as the protected
    fighting platform.

Batch gradient descent
Vanilla gradient descent
    Computes the gradient of the cost function
    w.r.t. to the parameters θ.

faceted search
    A count of attributes.

    Example,
        eCommerce sites use facets to tell
        customers how many items of a specific
        model, size, color, and other
        attributes are found)

solr
    Probably a better search engine that
    sphinx.

    Sphinx vs Solr, or Solr vs Sphinx, or
    Sphinx vs Elasticsearch as they all are
    decent competitors, with almost equal
    performance, scalability, and features.

    It uses Apache Lucene, probably even the
    query language.

    Though I should probably stick with
    ElasticSearch.

Overloaded Function
Function overloading
    The ability to create multiple functions
    of the same name with different
    implementations.

This, that
    The 'demonstrative'.

    Type of 'determiner'.

The
    The 'definite article'.

    Type of 'determiner'.

determiner
    Common kinds of determiners include
    definite and indefinite articles (like the
    English the and a or an), demonstratives
    (this and that), possessive determiners
    (my and their), quantifiers (many, few and
    several), numerals, distributive
    determiners (each, any), and interrogative
    determiners (which).

modal verb
    Examples
    - will

    They have various uses, including the
    expression of propositions about the
    future.

poincare duality [theorem]
    A basic result on the structure of the
    homology and cohomology groups of
    manifolds. It states that if M is an
    n-dimensional oriented closed manifold
    (compact and without boundary), then the
    kth cohomology group of M is isomorphic to
    the (n  k)th homology group of M, for all
    integers k

    Holds for any coefficient ring, so long as
    one has taken an orientation with respect
    to that coefficient ring;
        in particular, since every manifold
        has a unique orientation mod 2,
        Poincar duality holds mod 2 without
        any assumption of orientation.

Adam
Adaptive Moment Estimation
   Another method that computes adaptive
   learning rates for each parameter.

   In addition to storing an exponentially
   decaying average of past squared gradients
   v_t like Adadelta and RMSprop, Adam also
   keeps an exponentially decaying average of
   past gradients m_t, similar to momentum.

   Whereas momentum can be seen as a ball
   running down a slope, Adam behaves like a
   heavy ball with friction, which thus
   prefers flat minima in the error surface.

   We compute the decaying averages of past
   and past squared gradients m_t and v_t
   respectively.

jsonnet
    A simple extension of JSON.

pyro
    Built on pytorch.

Residual Network
    It's so simple that it's a type of
    network.  Is your X network also a
    Residual Network?

    Feed into the next layer:
    - output of previous layer
    - input of previous layer
      This is the new idea.

    Solved the vanishing gradient problem.

    Very good for ImageNet classification.
    Beat GoogleNet. Beat everything else.

    Able to be trained up to 1000 layers deep
    while avoiding vanishing gradients.

    The only difference is that instead of
    feeding only the output into the next
    layer, you feed also the input into the
    next layer.

Vanishing Gradient
    That lower accuracy that occurs with
    deeper networks.

inadmissible
    Not accepted as valid.

    (especially of evidence in court)

Euler's Method
    A numerical method to solve first order
    first degree differential equation with a
    given initial value.

    The Euler method often serves as the basis
    to construct more complex methods, e.g.,
    predictor-corrector method.

Differentiable Programming
    A shift opposite from the direction taken
    by deep learning;
    - from increasingly heavily parameterised
      models to simpler ones that take more
      advantage of problem structure.

Monte Carlo Analysis
    Applications
    - risk analysis

    Builds models of possible results by
    substituting a range of values (a
    probability distribution) for any factor
    that has inherent uncertainty.

    It then calculates results over and over,
    each time using a different set of random
    values from the probability functions.

[theory of] quantum gravity
    Unites Quantum Physics with General
    Relativity.

    Answers the question:
        What's the gravitational pull of a
        particle in a quantum superposition?

nix [package manager]
    https://chris-martin.org/2017/nix-for-stack-users

    Think of Nix like Stack, but with a much
    broader scope.

    Stack is there to manage your project's
    dependencies, and help you run their
    programs and compile stuff with them, but
    only if the dependencies are Haskell
    packages.

    Nix dependencies can be... kinda any
    software at all.

    Nix and Stack work together nicely. When
    you enable Nix integration for Stack, you
    can add any software as a dependency of
    your Stack project.

nix-shell
    Like "stack exec".

C
    To be able to know the address of a
    variable is of paramount importance.

Memory layout of a process
    | Stack    | Stores temporary variables
    | program? |
    | Heap     | Stores global variables
    | Code     |

Variable placeholder
    printf("The address of test is %d");

FILO
First in, last out.

etc
    As a footnote, I just received email from Dennis Ritchie
    stating:

    I assure you that the original contents of /etc
    were the "et cetera" that didn't seem to fit elsewhere.
    Other variants might do their own etymologies differently.

amortized
    Gradually write off the initial cost of

Refinement type
    [type theory]

    A type endowed with a predicate which is
    assumed to hold for any element of the
    refined type.

    Can express preconditions when used as
    function arguments or postconditions when
    used as return types.

    Example:
    - a natural number

    Haskell libraries
    - LiquidHaskell

SMT [problem]
Satisfiability modulo theories [problem]
    A form of the constraint satisfaction
    problem.

    A certain formalized approach to
    constraint programming.

    A decision problem for logical formulas
    with respect to combinations of background
    theories expressed in classical
    first-order logic with equality.

    http://goto.ucsd.edu:8090/index.html#?demo=refinements101.hs

Promise API
    https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3884281/what-does-the-function-then-mean-in-javascript

    Designed to solve the callback nesting
    problem and the error handling that comes
    with it.

    functions
    - .then()

tacit [knowledge]
    understood or implied without being stated.

golden ratio
    The most irrational number, because it has
    the simplest continued fraction.

    Has 2 forms:
    - φ = 1 + 1 / φ
    - 1/φ = 0 + 1 / φ

    Continued fraction:
    - φ = 1 + 1 / (1 + 1 / φ')

    The reason it's found everywhere in nature
    (and fibonacci numbers, by extension) must
    be because:
    - the simplicity of its formula
    - it embodies the limit of irrationality
      you can achieve with only one variable.

Language Oriented Programming
LOP

Nothing
    [Nothing :: Maybe a]

    It's the type-safe equivalent of a void
    pointer (i.e. void *).

Colon
    [English]

    (instead of a semicolon)

    May be used between independent clauses
    when the second sentence explains,
    illustrates, paraphrases, or expands on
    the first sentence.

    Example:
        He got what he worked for: he really
        earned that promotion.

Semicolon
    [English]

    Example:
        I have a big test tomorrow; I can't go
        out tonight.

    The two clauses in that sentence are
    separated by a semicolon and could be
    sentences on their own if you put a period
    between them instead.

Macros
    [Racket]

    Some Racketeers quibble with this term,
    preferring syntax transformers, because a
    Racket macro can be more sophisticated
    than the usual Common Lisp macro.

Monadic Parser Combinator
    A popular approach to building recursive
    descent parsers in FP.
    - model parsers as functions, and
    - define higher-order functions (or
      combinators) that implement grammar
      constructions such as sequencing,
      choice, and repetition.

    Such parsers form an
    instance of a monad.

    http://www.cs.nott.ac.uk/~pszgmh/monparsing.pdf
    $HOME/notes2018/ws/parser-combinators/monparsing.txt

Normed Division Algebras:
    There are exactly four:
    - real numbers (R),
    - complex numbers (C),
    - quaternions (ℍ), and
    - octonions (O).

Software Transactional Memory
STM
    A concurrency control mechanism analogous
    to database transactions for controlling
    access to shared memory in concurrent
    computing.

merkle trees
    A type of data structure.

    Used by
    - Git
    - blockchain

git
    Not an example of blockchain technology.

    Bult is similar, as are Merkel trees.

    In a blockchain implementation, every
    block is verified independently multiple
    times before it is added to the
    blockchain.

Personal Specific Language
PSR

Semantic Analysis
    The process of relating syntactic
    structures, from the levels of phrases,
    clauses, sentences and paragraphs to the
    level of the writing as a whole, to their
    language-independent meanings.

    According to Chen, parsing is the easy
    part and the semantic analysis is the hard
    part.

TOML
Tom's Obvious, Minimal Language
    [configuration file format]

    Easy to read.

    Designed to map unambiguously to a
    dictionary.

    Appears to be used often by cargo.

functor
function object
    A construct allowing an object to be
    invoked or called as if it were an
    ordinary function, usually with the same
    syntax (a function parameter that can also
    be a function).

functor
    [category theory]
    A structure-preserving transformation
    between categories.

    It's some way to map objects from one
    category to objects of another category
    while also preserving the arrows between
    objects—think of it as a category
    homomorphism.

    In a broad sense, a functor is the moral
    equivalent of a function between
    categories.

endofunctor
    A functor from one category back to the
    same category.

    It maps objects of the category to objects
    of the same category.

    The simplest example is the identity
    functor which maps every object inside a
    category back to itself; more interesting
    examples map objects to other objects in
    the same category.

Hot swap
    The replacement of a hard drive, CD-ROM
    drive, power supply, or other device with
    a similar device while the computer system
    using it remains in operation.

    The replacement can be because of a device
    failure or, for storage devices, to
    substitute other data.

Binding
    A binding is a correspondence between a
    name and its value.

Dynamic Binding
    All variable names and their values live
    in one global table.

    In contrast to "Lexical Binding".

Dynamic Binding vs Static Binding
    Two regimes for handling variable binding.

    The difference is more subtle
    than their names imply.

    Lexical and dynamic binding refer to how
    variables are looked up by their names.

Binding Scope
    Examples:
    - function
    - let syntax

Lexical Binding
Static Binding
    Each binding scope creates a new table of
    variable names and values, organised in a
    hierarchy called "the environment".

    In contrast to "Dynamic Binding".

coherence time
    [For an electromagnetic wave]

    The time over which a propagating wave
    (especially a laser or maser beam) may be
    considered coherent.

    The time interval within which its phase
    is, on average, predictable.

[a] non-deterministic computation
    A computation that:

    Instead of producing a single result, it
    might produce many.

    not a pure function.

List Monad
    Turns a non-deterministic computation
    (which is not a pure function) into a pure
    function one by transforming its result
    type from a to a list of a.

    In essence, we create a function that
    returns all possible results at once.

rank 1 polymorphism
    While you can write a function that takes
    different types of arguments without this
    extension, you can't write a function that
    uses its argument as different types in
    the same invocation.

rank 2 polymorphism
    Provided in haskell with the Rank2Types
    extension.

parametric polymorphism
    The type truly does not matter (fringe,
    for example, really doesn't care what kind
    of elements are found in the leaves of a
    tree). In Haskell, type classes provide a
    structured way to control ad hoc
    polymorphism, or overloading.

    This is different from ad-hoc
    polymorphism.

ad-hoc polymorphism
overloading
    https://www.haskell.org/tutorial/classes.html

    Examples:
    - The literals 1, 2, etc. are often used
      to represent both fixed and arbitrary
      precision integers.
    - Numeric operators such as + are often
      defined to work on many different kinds
      of numbers.
    - The equality operator (== in Haskell)
      usually works on numbers and many other
      (but not all) types.

    Note that these overloaded behaviors are
    different for each type (in fact the
    behavior is sometimes undefined, or
    error).

    This is different from parametric
    polymorphism.

sideload
sideloading
    Similar to "upload" and "download".

    The process of transferring files between
    two local devices, in particular between a
    computer and a mobile device such as a
    mobile phone, smartphone, PDA, tablet,
    portable media player or e-reader.

e^x
    For any x,
      the value of e^x at x ==
        gradient at x ==
          area (between curve and y=0)

    value (of y) == gradient == area

    When writing math to do with calculus, if
    you write in terms of e then the math
    becomes simpler.

Nonlinearity
    A common issue when examining cause-effect
    relations.

    Such instances require complex modeling
    and hypothesis to offer explanations to
    nonlinear events.

    Nonlinearity without explanation can lead
    to random, unforecasted outcomes such as
    chaos.

superposition principle
superposition property
    For all linear systems, the net response
    caused by two or more stimuli is the sum
    of the responses that would have been
    caused by each stimulus individually.

    Simple explanation:
    If input A produces response X, and
    input B produces response Y, then
    input (A + B) produces response (X + Y).

semver
Semantic Version
    https://semver.org/

    Given a version number MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH,
    increment the:
    - MAJOR version when you make incompatible API changes,
    - MINOR version when you add functionality in a backwards-compatible manner, and
    - PATCH version when you make backwards-compatible bug fixes.

    Additional labels for pre-release and
    build metadata are available as extensions
    to the MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH format.

Homotopy Type Theory
    A new field of study relating Martin-Löf’s
    system of intensional, constructive type
    theory with abstract homotopy theory.

    Propositional equality is interpreted as
    homotopy and type isomorphism as homotopy
    equivalence.

    Logical constructions in type theory then
    correspond to homotopy-invariant
    constructions on spaces, while theorems
    and even proofs in the logical system
    inherit a homotopical meaning.

    As the natural logic of homotopy,
    constructive type theory is also related
    to higher category theory as it is used
    e.g. in the notion of a higher topos.

orthologous
    Homologous sequences are orthologous if
    they are inferred to be descended from the

        when a species diverges into two
        separate species, the copies of a

    The Maybe type is also a monad.

    It is a simple kind of error monad, where
    all errors are represented by Nothing.

    A richer error monad can be built using
    the Either type.

    a unique edge.

    A complete digraph is a directed graph in
    which every pair of distinct vertices is
    connected by a pair of unique edges (one
    in each direction).

disjoint union [of two sets]

Skolemization

satisfiability and validity
    satisfiability and validity are elementary
    concepts of semantics.

validity
    [of a function]

    A formula is valid if all interpretations
    make the formula true.

satisfiable
    [of a function]

    It is possible to find an interpretation
    that makes the formula true.

existential quantifier
∃...
    A logical constant which is interpreted as
    "there exists", "there is at least one",
    or "for some".

    \exists {n}{\in }\mathbb {N} \,P(n,n,25)

Skolem normal form
SNF
    Reduction to SNF is a method for removing
    existential quantifiers from formal logic
    statements.

    The first step in an automated theorem
    prover.

    A formula of first-order logic is in
    Skolem normal form if it is in prenex
    normal form with only universal
    first-order quantifiers.

first-order language
    Its interpretation assigns a denotation to
    each non-logical symbol in that language,
    and determines a domain of discourse, D,
    that specifies the range of the
    quantifiers.

domain of discourse
D
    A nonempty set of "objects" of some kind.

first-order formula
    A statement about the objects in a domain
    of discourse.

    Example:
        ∃xP(x)
        The existence of an object x such that
        the predicate P is true where referred
        to it.

Skolemization
    Every first-order formula may be converted
    into SNF while not changing its
    satisfiability via a process called
    Skolemization. The resulting formula is
    not necessarily equivalent to the original
    one, but is equisatisfiable with it.

equisatisfiable
    Satisfiable if and only if the original
    one is satisfiable.

Sequence Similarity Search
Homology Search
    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3820096/

    Can identify ”homologous” proteins or
    genes by detecting excess similarity –
    statistically significant similarity that
    reflects common ancestry.

    This unit provides an overview of the
    inference of homology from significant
    similarity, and introduces other units in
    this chapter that provide more details on
    effective strategies for identifying
    homologs.

    * homology search
    - homolog search (sequences that share a common evolutionary ancestor)
    - inference of functional similarity from homology

    The relationship between homology
    (structure) and function is complex.

    Homology is inferred from significant
    similarity.

    Then you need to connect homology to more
    accurate functional prediction.

    algebraic objects such as abelian groups
    or modules to other mathematical objects
    such as topological spaces.

cohomology
    [noun]
    A sequence of abelian groups associated to
    a topological space, often defined from a
    cochain complex.

    [verb]
    A method of assigning richer algebraic
    invariants to a space than homology.

realism
    The universe exists independent of the
    mind of the observer.

    Quantum Mechanics still has scientists
    wondering if we should reject this premise.

    Extends special relativity to include
    gravity and its effects on spacetime.

bisociation
bisociative
    The simultaneous mental association of an
    idea or object with two fields ordinarily
    not regarded as related the pun is perhaps
    the simplest form of bisociation.

recommender systems
    Both association rules and collaborative
    filtering can be used for building
    recommender systems but answer
    fundamentally different questions.

collaborative filtering
    [algorithm]

    Answers the question:
    - What items do users with interests
      similar to yours like?

    Used in recommender system.

association rules
    [algorithm]

    Answers the question:
    - What items do frequently appear
      together?

    Used in recommender system.

    Algorithms:
    - a-priori

text simplification
    Not the same as summarization.

    Consists of:
    - syntactic simplification
      addressing sentence structure
    - lexical simplification
      addressing words and short phrases
    - explanation generation
      addressing word meanings

hyperparameter
    A parameter whose value is used to control
    the learning process.

    By contrast, the values of other
    parameters (typically node weights) are
    derived via training.

learning the parameters of a model
parameter learning
    Given a set of data cases or observations
    and a model structure, one can infer the
    distribution over the model parameters,
    found for instance in the conditional
    probability table1 in the clique
    potentials, in the mapping, or the
    transition probabilities.

    Does not differ from inference in Bayesian
    probability theory, so the reasons for
    studying them separately are mostly
    practical.

    For instance in the EM algorithm, the
    updates of parameters and latent variables
    are done separately and in different ways.

Support
    [Association Rule Mining]

    An indication of how frequently the items
    appear in the data.

    n_(X,Y) = number of transactions containing both X and Y
    n       = Total number of transations

                          n_(X,Y)
    Support({X} -> {Y}) = -------
                             n

    n_X     = number of transactions X appears in

              n_X
    supp(X) = ---
               n

    statements are found true.

    n_(X,Y) = number of transactions containing both X and Y
    n_X     = number number of transations containing X

                             n_(X,Y)
    Confidence({X} -> {Y}) = -------
                               n_X

black hole gravity assist
    If you try to approach a black hole
    through elliptical orbit where the "near
    pass" speed would exceed speed of light if
    counted in Newton and Kepler way,
    obviously that won't work.

    Instead of speed that would counteract the
    centripetal force of gravity of the black
    hole, you'll start gaining mass, and that
    will make the black hole's gravitational
    pull on you so much stronger.

    "Falling", instead of speeding up you keep
    gaining weight, and so the gravity pull
    grows not only with waning distance but
    with your kinetic energy growing - until
    the inevitable demise.

engram
    A hypothetical permanent change in the
    brain accounting for the existence of
    memory; a memory trace.

    Theorized to be means by which memories
    are stored as biophysical or biochemical
    changes in the brain in response to
    external stimuli. The existence of engrams
    is posited by some scientific theories to
    explain the persistence of memory and how
    memories are stored in the brain.

        Generally fast, but has the
        possibility of running slowly if
        you're "unlucky" with a particular
        regexp. that's because it's a
        backtracking algorithm.

    re2
        generally a little slower that
        oniguruma, but it doesn't have the
        same risk - its time will never[*]
        explode in the same way (it doesn't
        have worst case exponential
        behaviour).

Conservation of Étendue
    https://worldbuilding.stackexchange.com/questions/124957/would-turning-the-planet-mercury-into-a-giant-mirror-be-a-good-way-to-heat-the-o

    You cannot gather light from a wide cone,
    and then send it out into a thin beam.

    This means that whatever light you reflect
    off of Mercury, when it reaches Neptune
    that light covers an area that is 75 time
    larger than the Sun, in effect 75 times
    weaker per unit of surface area than what
    hits Mercury.

regex
regular algebra
    Comes from Neuroscience.

    It was considered at the time that this
    was the closest thing to mimicking the
    human brain.

    It could find things, like finding a
    needle in a haystack.

    - perlre code in matcher
    - custom predicates

    Inside a (?{...}) block
    - $_
      The string the regular expression is

backtracking
    For a regular expression to match, the
    entire regular expression must match, not
    just part of it.

    So if the beginning of a pattern
    containing a quantifier succeeds in a way
    that causes later parts in the pattern to
    fail, the matching engine backs up and
    recalculates the beginning part--that's
    why it's called backtracking.

Decision tree regression
Decision tree (misnomer)
    Builds a regression or classification
    model in the form of a tree structure.

    Break down a dataset into smaller and
    smaller subsets while at the same time an
    associated decision tree is incrementally
    developed.

    Result:
    Tree with decision nodes and leaf nodes.

    Example:
    A decision node (e.g., Outlook) has two or
    more branches (e.g., Sunny, Overcast and
    Rainy), each representing values for the
    attribute tested. Leaf node (e.g., Hours
    Played) represents a decision on the
    numerical target. The topmost decision
    node in a tree which corresponds to the
    best predictor called root node. Decision
    trees can handle both categorical and
    numerical data.

Standard Deviation Reduction
    Based on the decrease in standard
    deviation after a dataset is split
    on an attribute.

    Constructing a decision tree is all about
    finding attribute that returns the highest
    standard deviation reduction (i.e., the
    most homogeneous branches).

Learning rate
    But the best learning rate in general is
    one that decreases as the model approaches
    a solution (minimum to the loss function).

    Hyperparameters
    - learning rate decay

Learning rate decay
    Used to decrease the learning rate as
    epochs go by to allow learning to advance
    faster at the beginning with larger
    learning rates.

batch size
    [#machine learning]

    The number of training examples utilized
    in one iteration.

    The batch size can be one of three
    options:
    - batch mode:
      batch size = size(total dataset)

      Thus iteration = epoch value.

    - mini-batch mode:
      batch size > 1, but
      batch size < size(total dataset)

      Usually, a number that can be divided into
      the total dataset size.

    - stochastic mode:
      batch size = 1

      Therefore the gradient and the neural
      network parameters are updated after each
      sample.

epoch
    [#deep learning]

    ewwlinks +/"When all the batches are fed exactly once you complete what is called an epoch." "https://www.quora.com/What-is-epochs-in-machine-learning"

    Suppose that you want to train a machine
    learning model with some data. That data
    you call training data.

    Now, the thing is that for huge sets of
    training data you cannot feed the whole
    bunch to your model at once due to
    limitations in computer memory.

    So, what you do is break up your whole
    training data set into sizeable batches
    which can fit into your computer’s memory
    at once.

    You then feed these batches one by one to
    your model for training.

    When all the batches are fed exactly once
    you complete what is called an epoch.
    Basically it is equivalent to showing your
    model the whole training data bunch once.

    Now, you have to carry this one multiple
    times for successful training, hence,
    multiple epochs.

Momentum
    vim +/"stuck in a local minimum" "$HOME/notes2018/problems-and-solutions.txt"

    Pushes your output towards global optimum.

    Too big or too small will ruin everything.

    Changes the path you take to the optimum.

    It helps overcome local optimum (If you
    get stuck).

    example:
        If you have an objective function, you
        have to decide how to move around on it.

        Steepest descent on the gradient is the
        simplest approach, but fluctuations could
        be a big problem.

        Adding momentum helps solve that problem.

    NOTE: High momentum should always be
    accompanied by low learning rate, else you
    will overshoot the global optimum.

    In my opinion the momentum should be more
    adaptive than constant. Sometimes you may
    be revolving around the global optimum.
    Recognizing that and changing your
    momentum is tough but a smart choice.

Adaptive learning rate method
    Computes individual learning rates for
    different parameters.

Adaptive Moment Estimation
Adam
    [optimiser]
    [adaptive learning rate method]

    Its name is derived from adaptive moment
    estimation, and the reason it’s called
    that is because Adam uses estimations of
    first and second moments of gradient to
    adapt the learning rate for each weight of
    the neural network.

    Now, what is moment ?

    N-th moment of a random variable is
    defined as the expected value of that
    variable to the power of n.

Training with SGD
    - Randomly initialise the weights to small
      numbers close to 0 (but not 0).

    - Input the first observation of your
      dataset in the input layer, each feature
      in one input node.

    - Forward propagation
      - The neurons are activated in a way
        that the impact of each neuron's
        activation is limited by the weights.
      - Propagate the activations until
        getting the predicted result y.

    - Compare the predicted result to the
      actual result. Measure the generated
      error.

    - Back-propagation:
      from right to left, the error is
      back-propagated. Update the weights
      according to how much they are
      responsibile for the error.

    - 2 next steps:
      - Reinforcement learning
        Repeat steps 1 to 5 and update the
        weights after each observation.
      - Batch learning
        Repeat steps 1 to 5 and update the
        weights only after a batch of
        observations.

    - When the whowle training set passed
      through the ANN, that makes an epoch.
      Redo more epochs.

Optimiser
    Used to minimise the error rate.

    Two metrics to determine the efficacy of
    an optimizer:
    - speed of convergence
      (the process of reaching a global
      optimum for gradient descent); and
    - generalization
      (the model’s performance on new data).

differentiable programming

    Programs can be differentiated throughout,
    usually via automatic differentiation.

    Allows for gradient based optimization of
    parameters in the program, often via
    gradient descent.

    As a big picture, I really believe that a
    purely functional typed approach to
    differentiable programming is the way to
    move forward in the future for models like
    artificial neural networks.

endofunctor
    A functor from one category back to the
    same category.

    It maps objects of the category to objects
    of the same category.

    The simplest example is the identity
    functor which maps every object inside a
    category back to itself; more interesting
    examples map objects to other objects in
    the same category.

    Examples:
    - identity functor

    Interesting because they do a good job of
    representing structures inside categories
    that work for any object.

    Among other things, this is very useful
    for programming. The Haskell Functor class
    represents endofunctors on the category of
    Haskell types and functions, which
    includes pretty much every generic
    container among other things.

    Is the universe a strange loop?

    May involve self-reference and paradox.

    The concept of a strange loop was proposed

Oceanic Anoxic Event 2
OAE 2
    Took place around the Cenomanian–Turonian
    boundary (∼94 Ma), is associated with
    extreme perturbations to the global carbon
    cycle, affected ocean basins worldwide and
    was associated with significant biological
    turnover.

    Although this event has been well studied
    in the northern hemisphere, the evolution
    and character of OAE 2, particularly in
    terms of the vertical and lateral extent
    of anoxia, is poorly constrained in the
    palaeo-Pacific Ocean.

    Furthermore, the precise timing, duration
    and character of this event, and the exact
    mechanisms driving OAE 2 environmental
    changes, are still being debated.

    https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0012821X19302328

    Present
    - high-resolution records of:
      - carbon isotopes,
      - total organic carbon, and
      - magnetic susceptibility

      from the southern palaeo-Pacific Ocean
      during OAE 2, sampled at two sections in
      New Zealand.

    The carbon isotope records from both
    localities reveal a ∼2‰ positive excursion
    that represents the global change in the
    carbon cycle associated with OAE 2.

    When combined with a cyclostratigraphic
    age model, these new records constrain the
    duration of the OAE 2 carbon isotope
    excursion to at least 930 ± 25 ky and
    indicate a minimum duration of 200 ± 25 ky
    for the ‘Plenus Cold Event’ that took
    place during OAE 2.

    The lithologies and low organic-carbon
    contents of the New Zealand sections imply
    that oxic conditions prevailed along, at
    least parts of, the margins of the palaeo-
    Pacific Ocean at mid- to high southern
    latitudes during OAE 2 while,
    contemporaneously, conditions were locally
    anoxic in the mid-water column of the
    equatorial Pacific Ocean.

    Despite these apparently oxic conditions
    in the New Zealand region, there was a
    partial collapse of benthic ecosystems
    leading up to, and during, OAE 2,
    suggesting environmental deterioration
    caused by intermittent oxygen deprivation,
    or other chemical or biological
    disturbances in the South Pacific region
    that remain to be elucidated.

Autoregressive [process]

    [#statistics]
    [#econometrics]

    Example:
    - transformer

    Autoregression is a time series model that
    uses observations from previous time steps
    as input to a regression equation to
    predict the value at the next time step.
    It is a very simple idea that can result
    in accurate forecasts on a range of time
    series problems.

    The autoregressive model specifies that
    the output variable depends linearly on
    its own previous values and on a
    stochastic term (an imperfectly
    predictable term); thus the model is in
    the form of a stochastic difference
    equation.

    Every output sequence depends not only on
    the input, but also on previous outputs.

    Stochastic calculations in which future
    values are estimated based on a weighted
    sum of past values.

    A representation of a type of random
    process; as such, it is used to describe
    certain time-varying processes in nature,
    economics, etc.

autoregressive property
    "Autoregressive models decompose the joint
    density as a product of conditionals, and
    model each conditional in turn.
    Normalizing flows transform a base density
    (e.g. a standard Gaussian) into the target
    density by an invertible transformation
    with tractable Jacobian."

    In other words, the "autoregressive
    property" is equivalent to the
    decomposition:

        p(x) = prod{ p(x[i] | x[0:i]) : i=0, ..., d }.

    The provided shift_and_log_scale_fn,
    masked_autoregressive_default_template,
    achieves this property by zeroing out
    weights in its masked_dense layers.

    Practically speaking:
        There exists a permutation of the
        event coordinates such that each
        coordinate is a diffeomorphic function
        of only preceding coordinates.

beta reduction
β reduction
    The process of calculating a result from
    the application of a function to an
    expression.

    Example
        Suppose we apply the function

        (\x -> 2*x*x + y)

        to the value 7.

        To calculate the result, we substitute
        7 for every occurrence of x, and so
        the application of the function

        (\x -> 2*x*x + y)(7)

        is reduced to the result

        2*7*7 + y

        This is a beta reduction.

sampling with replacement
    Find probability with replacement.

    Choose one person’s name, put that
    person’s name back in the hat, and then
    choose another name.

    Your two items are independent.

    One selection does not affect the outcome
    of the other.

    You have a 1 out of 7 (1/7) chance of
    choosing the first name and a 1/7 chance
    of choosing the second name.

    Example:
        You want to find the probability of

        balls, cards or other objects, and you
        replace the item each time you choose

    Until now, scientists had assumed that
    Theia originated in the inner solar system
    near the Earth.

    However, researchers from Münster can now
    show that Theia comes from the outer solar
    system, and it delivered large quantities
    of water to Earth.

    generic programs are much more adaptive
    when faced with data structure evolution
    because they contain many fewer lines of
    typespecific code.

    This might solve my
    'try-to-filter-something-by-specific-way'
    problem.

    Use monads for this?

    Read this:

    This is very old, but it shows that
    Generic Programming with haskell is
    exactly what I've been raving about.

    Write code in a way where the programmer
    can concentrate on the problem and not on
    the extranous parsing and boilerplate.

    Haskell's 'Data' module provides classes
    for generic programming.

Generalised Algebraic Data Type
GADT
    [#fp]

    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalized_algebraic_data_type

    A GADT is a generalization of parametric
    algebraic data types.

    The 'A' in GADT always means Algebraic.

ADT
    [ambiguous acronym]

    Could be:
    - Abstract data type
    - Algebraic data type

    ewwlinks +/"Algebraic Data Type is not to be confused with \*Abstract\* Data Type, which" "https://wiki.haskell.org/Algebraic_data_type"

    Abstract Data Type is the opposite of Algebraic Data Type

Abstract Data Type
ADT
AbDT (to disambiguate with AlDT)
    A type (or class) for objects whose
    behavior is defined by a set of value and
    a set of operations

    May be defined as a "class of objects
    whose logical behavior is defined by a set
    of values and a set of operations".

    The characteristic feature of an AbDT is
    that the representation type is hidden.

    Don't confuse with 'Algebraic' Data Type.

anthropic principle
    [philosophical consideration]

    Observations of the universe must be
    compatible with the conscious and sapient
    life that observes it.

Algebraic Data Type
ADT
AlDT (to disambiguate with AbDT)
    [composite type]

    Formed by combining other types.

    A data type defined out of a combination
    of two constructions:
    - products, and
    - sums.

    Examples:
    - Singly linked list
    - Binary tree

    Product
    - A way to combine multiple values of
      different types into one.

      They're present in pretty much all
      languages, often called "structs",
      "records" or "tuples".

      In object-oriented programming, a class
      made up of public fields acts as a
      product type.

    Don't confuse with 'Abstract' Data Type.

data
data declaration
    [#haskell]

    hoogle -i --color data

    How one introduces new AlDT into Haskell. For example:

    Generic programming in Haskell

    It looks like we are building a struct.
    Not so much generic programming happening
    here.

    vim +/"data Val = Int Integer" "$MYGIT/acmeism/RosettaCodeData/Task/S-Expressions/Haskell/s-expressions.hs"

    create a datatype to hold an AST for an
    expression, one could use:

    data Exp = Ebin   Operator Exp Exp
             | Eunary Operator Exp
             | Efun   FunctionIdentifier [Exp]
             | Eid    SimpleIdentifier

    where the types
    - Operator,
    - FunctionIdentifier, and
    - SimpleIdentifier
    are defined elsewhere.

    The types
    - Ebin
    - Eunary
    - Efun
    are all types of Exp

    Exp is partially recursive.
    An Ebin can hold 2 of Exp.

factor graph
    [bipartite graph]

    Represents the factorization of a
    function.

    Used to represent factorization of a
    probability distribution function,
    enabling efficient computations, such as
    the computation of marginal distributions
    through the sum-product algorithm.

    One of the important success stories of
    factor graphs and the sum-product
    algorithm is the decoding of capacity-
    approaching error-correcting codes, such
    as LDPC and turbo codes.

    Factor graphs generalize constraint
    graphs.

    A factor whose value is either 0 or 1 is
    called a constraint.

    A constraint graph is a factor graph where
    all factors are constraints.

    The max-product algorithm for factor
    graphs can be viewed as a generalization
    of the arc-consistency algorithm for
    constraint processing.

marginal distribution [of a subset of a collection of random variables]
    The probability distribution of the
    variables contained in the subset.

    Gives the probabilities of various values
    of the variables in the subset without
    reference to the values of the other
    variables.

    This contrasts with a conditional
    distribution.

conditional distribution
    Gives the probabilities contingent upon
    the values of the other variables.

GAN
Generative Adversarial Network
    The generative network generates
    candidates while the discriminative
    network evaluates them.

    Invented by Ian Goodfellow.

    Contest often in the form of a zero-sum
    game.

marginal utility

Non-zero-sum game
    can be either:
    - competitive, or
    - non-competitive.

Zero-sum game
Strictly competitive game
    Each participant's gain or loss of utility
    is exactly balanced by the losses or gains
    of the utility of the other participants.

    If the total gains of the participants are
    added up and the total losses are
    subtracted, they will sum to zero.

    Example:
    - cutting a cake
      iff all participants value each unit of
      cake equally.
      See "marginal utility".

    In contrast, non-zero-sum describes a
    situation in which the interacting
    parties' aggregate gains and losses can be
    less than or more than zero.

    Most often solved with:
    - the minimax theorem
    - Nash equilibrium

minimax theorem
    Closely related to linear
    programming duality.

discriminator [network]
    [#GAN]

    Evaluates candidates from a generative
    network.

Distributed dense word vectors
    Shown to be effective at capturing
    token-level semantic and syntactic
    regularities in language, while topic
    models can form interpretable
    representations over documents.

embedding
    A feature vector representation of
    something.

    Good definition:
        The model's internal representation of
        an input.

    Example::
    - Word vector

latent space
    The model thinks that these variables are
    correlated and have meaning, but we have
    no idea why.

input embedder
    The first stage of the network, meant to
    convert the input into a feature vector
    representation.

categorical variable
    [variable]

    Can take on one of a limited, and usually
    fixed number of possible values, assigning
    each individual or other unit of
    observation to a particular group or
    nominal category on the basis of some
    qualitative property.

observable variable
manifest variable
    A variable that can be directly measured
    or observed.

    Opposite of a latent variable,

latent variable
    Can not be directly observed.

    Needs a manifest variable assigned to it
    as an indicator to test whether it is
    present.

latent variable model
    [statistical model]

    Relates a set of observable variables to a
    set of latent variables.

putative gene structure

modus tollens
method of denying
    [rule of logic]

Microcode
    [computer hardware technique]

    Imposes an interpreter between the CPU
    hardware and the programmer-visible
    instruction set architecture of the
    computer.

ambiguity
    One of the greatest challenges to NLP:
    Example:
    - Fed raises interest rates, where
      "raises" is the verb, and "Fed" is the
      noun phrase
    - Fed raises interest rates, where
      "interest" is the verb, and "Fed raises"
      is the noun phrase

    Occurs at many levels:
    - acoustic
      e.g. mixing up similar-sounding words
    - syntactic level
      e.g. multiple plausible grammatical
      parsings of a sentence
    - semantic level
      e.g. some words can mean multiple things
      ("bank" as in a river or a financial
      institution); this is called word sense
      ambiguity
    - discourse (multi-clause)
      e.g. unclear what a pronoun is referring
      to

token
    An instance of that type in running text;
    $N$ = number of tokens, i.e. counting
    every word in the sentence, regardless of
    uniqueness.

type
    An element of the vocabulary; $V$ =
    vocabulary = set of types ($|V|$ = the
    size of the vocabulary), i.e. counting
    every unique word in the sentence.

Tensorflow
    http://theprofessionalspoint.blogspot.com/2019/05/tensorflow-tensors-computational-graphs.html

Estimator
    [#tensorflow]
    [Tensorflow API]

    Used to implement algorithms.

    Can import following estimators APIs to
    solve a lot of classification and
    regression problems:
    - tf.estimator.LinearRegressor
    - tf.estimator.LinearClassifier
    - tf.estimator.BoostedTreesRegressor
    - tf.estimator.BoostedTreesClassifier
    - tf.estimator.DNNClassifier
    - tf.estimator.DNNLinearCombinedClassifier

    Used for
    - creating computational graphs,
    - initializing variables,
    - training the model, and
    - saving checkpoint
    - logging files for Tensorboard.

    In order to use estimators, must create:
    - feature columns, and
    - input functions.

Input function
    [#tensorflow]

    Used for passing input data to the model
    for training and evaluation.

Feature columns
    Specifications for how the model should
    interpret the input data.

    We will see these concepts in detail when
    we solve a problem using TensorFlow in my
    future posts.

locus
loci (plural)
    [#genetics]

    A fixed position on a chromosome, like the
    position of a gene or a marker (genetic
    marker).

    Example:
        Each chromosome carries many genes;
        human's estimated 'haploid' protein
        coding genes are 19,000–20,000, on the
        23 different chromosomes.

F-algebra
    [#category theory]

    F-algebras generalize algebraic structure.

    Rewriting the algebraic laws in terms of
    morphisms eliminates all references to
    quantified elements from the axioms, and
    these algebraic laws may then be glued
    together in terms of a single functor F,
    the signature.

    F-algebras can also be used to represent
    data structures used in programming, such
    as lists and trees.

contract
    [#racket]

    Rich, expressive contracts take the place
    of dependent types.

disjoint union
tagged union
discriminated union
    [...of a family of sets]

    A modified union operation that indexes
    the elements according to which set they
    originated in.

universal type
    [#racket]

    Racket is an untyped languages.

    vimlinks +/"no need for a special embedding" "http://matt.might.net/articles/discrete-math-and-code/"

        The universal type is already the sum
        of all types, there is no need for a
        special embedding.

regression
    Like the Rosetta Stone between math,
    statistics, machine learning, and
    programming.

linear regression
    A basic and commonly used type of
    predictive analysis.

    The overall idea of regression is to
    examine two things:
    - (1) does a set of predictor variables do
      a good job in predicting an outcome
      (dependent) variable?
    - (2) Which variables in particular are
      significant predictors of the outcome
      variable, and in what way do
      they–indicated by the magnitude and sign
      of the beta estimates–impact the outcome
      variable?

    These regression estimates are used to
    explain the relationship between one
    dependent variable and one or more
    independent variables.

    The simplest form of the regression
    equation with one dependent and one
    independent variable is defined by the
    formula y = c + b*x, where y = estimated
    dependent variable score, c = constant, b
    = regression coefficient, and x = score on
    the independent variable.

Simulated annealing
SA
    [#probability]
    [technique]
    [metaheuristic]

    Obsolete.

    Approximate alternative to SGD.

    Considered pretty much obsolete in
    optimization circles as there are much
    better alternatives which are both more
    reliable and less costly.

    Approximates the global optimum of a given
    function.

    Finds the best solution for either a
    global minimum or maximum, without having
    to check every single possible solution
    that exists.

    Specifically:
        Approximates global optimization in a
        large search space for an optimization
        problem.

    It is often used when the search space is
    discrete (e.g., all tours that visit a
    given set of cities).

    For problems where finding an approximate
    global optimum is more important than
    finding a precise local optimum in a fixed
    amount of time, simulated annealing may be
    preferable to alternatives such as
    gradient descent.

TensorFlow
    optimizers
        The optimizers included with TF are
        all variations on GD.  There are many
        other optimizers that people use like
        simulated annealing, conjugate
        gradient and ant colony optimization
        but these tend to either not work well
        with multi-layer Neural Networks or
        don’t parallelize well to run on GPUs
        or a distributed network or are far
        too computationally intensive for
        large matrices.

grammar
formal grammar
formal description
    [...of a regular language]

    Usually a collection of re-write rules
    or productions or alternatively as a
    finite state machine or automaton of some
    kind.

Induction of regular languages
grammar induction
grammatical inference
    [#deep learning]
    [process]
    [task]

    Learn a grammar from a given set of
    example strings / observations.

    Not every regular language can be learned
    this way if the provided examples are
    specifically chosen to mislead (see
    language identification in the limit),
    approaches have been investigated for a
    variety of subclasses.

    Output:
        A model which accounts for the
        characteristics of the observed
        objects.

    That branch of machine learning where the
    instance space consists of discrete
    combinatorial objects such as strings,
    trees and graphs.

Language-oriented programming
LOP
    [interface-design technique]

    Unbeatable for tasks that demand:
    - minimum notation, while preserving
    - maximum precision

continuation
    A representation of the control flow of
    your program at any point in time,
    essentially the stack.

    In abstract terms, it represents "the rest
    of your program."

    In languages like Scheme that expose
    continuations as first-class values, you
    can capture the current continuation and
    invoke it later.

multi-source domain adaptation.
    Like domain adaption but with multiple
    source domains.

Domain adaptation
    [#machine learning]
    [#transfer learning]

    From a source data distribution, learning
    a model that performs well on a different
    (but related) target data distribution.

    Beneficial for learning unrelated sources.

    One of the tasks of the common spam
    filtering problem consists in adapting a
    model from one user (the source
    distribution) to a new one who receives
    significantly different emails (the target
    distribution).

    When more than one source distribution is
    available the problem is referred to as
    multi-source domain adaptation.

document clustering
text clustering
    The application of cluster analysis
    (clustering) to textual documents.

    Cluster documents.

    Applications:
    - automatic document organization,
    - topic extraction, and
    - fast IR or filtering.

distributional semantics
distributional semantic models
    Applications:
    - semantic similarity between words and
      multi-word expressions
    - word clustering based on semantic
      similarity
    - generate thesauri and bilingual
      dictionaries
    - lexical ambiguity resolution
    - expanding search requests using synonyms
      and associations
    - defining the topic of a document
    - document clustering for IR
    - data mining and named entities
      recognition;
    - creating semantic maps of different
      subject domains;
    - paraphrasing;
    - sentiment analysis;
    - modeling selectional preferences of
      words.

US patent system
    Basically it's almost like copyright: you
    can patent virtually anything that hasn't
    been patented yet until challenged in
    court as either trivial or not original
    (i.e. prior art exists).

    Essentially the US patent system achieves
    two goals:
    - shift the burden of verifications and
      validations to competitors and courts;
      and secondly,
    - provide the US some advantage on the
      international level via the Patent
      Cooperation Treaty.

    Any crappy patent may turn out to be
    important, so just let them register
    everything and see which one "sticks".

nonterminal
    An element of a grammar that can be
    decomposed into smaller pieces with a
    production rule.

kugelblitz
    So hot that not even science can

Neutron activation
    The process in which neutron radiation
    induces radioactivity in materials, and
    occurs when atomic nuclei capture free
    neutrons, becoming heavier and entering
    excited states.

roentgen
    A unit of ionizing radiation, the amount
    producing one electrostatic unit of
    positive or negative ionic charge in one
    cubic centimeter of air under standard
    conditions.

chemical formula
    A single typographic line of symbols.

    The chemical proportions of atoms that
    constitute a particular chemical compound
    or molecule.

    Uses:
    - chemical element symbols
    - numbers
    - parentheses
    - dashes

row-major order
vs
column-major order
    Methods for storing multidimensional
    arrays in linear storage such as random
    access memory.

    The difference between the orders lies in
    which elements of an array are contiguous
    in memory. In a row-major order, the
    consecutive elements of a row reside next
    to each other, whereas the same holds true
    for consecutive elements of a column in a
    column-major order.

bipartite graph
    A pair of nodes from each of the two
    groups of units (commonly referred to as
    the "visible" and "hidden" units
    respectively) may have a symmetric
    connection between them; and there are no
    connections between nodes within a group.

    Can answer this question:
        The distribution of blood types in the
        US is:

        | Type        |    O |    A |    B |   AB |
        |-------------+------+------+------+------|
        | Probability | 0.44 | 0.42 | 0.10 | 0.04 |

        In a random sample of 10 Americans,
        What is the probability 6 have blood
        type 0, 2 have type A, 1 has type B,
        and 1 has type AB?

    Example:
    - models the probability of counts for
      rolling a k-sided die n times.

Bijector
    [#TF Probability]

    Implements a smooth covering map, i.e., a
    local diffeomorphism such that every point
    in the target has a neighborhood evenly
    covered by a map.

    Used by TransformedDistribution but can be
    generally used for transforming a
    Distribution generated Tensor.

    A Bijector is characterized by three
    operations:
    - Forward
      Useful for turning one random outcome
      into another random outcome from a
      different distribution.

    - Inverse
      Useful for "reversing" a transformation
      to compute one probability in terms of
      another.

    - log_det_jacobian(x)
      "The log of the absolute value of the
      determinant of the matrix of all
      first-order partial derivatives of the
      inverse function." Useful for inverting
      a transformation to compute one
      probability in terms of another.
      Geometrically, the Jacobian determinant
      is the volume of the transformation and
      is used to scale the probability.

    models and DL on modern hardware (TPU,
    GPU).

    Given this generative model, we want to
    find model parameters so that the model
    can explain our observed data — that’s the
    goal of probabilistic inference!

    Performs probabilistic inference by
    evaluating the model using an unnormalized
    joint log probability function.

    The arguments to this joint_log_prob are
    data and model state.

    The function returns the log of the joint
    probability that the parameterized model
    generated the observed data.

    [#bayesian inference]
    [family of techniques]

    Used for:
    - approximating intractable integrals

Black box variational inference

    arxiv-summary +/"black box" "https://arxiv.org/abs/1401.0118"

    Can be quickly applied to many models with
    little additional derivation.

Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm
MCMC algorithm
    Generates a Markov chain of samples, each
    of which is correlated with nearby
    samples.

randomized algorithm
    An algorithm that makes use of random
    numbers.

expectation-maximization algorithm
EM algorithm
    An iterative method to find maximum
    likelihood or maximum a posteriori (MAP)
    estimates of parameters in statistical
    models, where the model depends on
    unobserved latent variables.

    http://georgepavlides.info/expectation-maximization-gaussian-mixtures-vectorized-matlab-octave-approach/

gibbs sampling
Gibbs sampler
    [MCMC algorithm]
    [randomised algorithm]

    Used when direct sampling is difficult.

    Obtains a sequence of observations which
    are approximated from a specified
    multivariate probability distribution.

    This sequence can be used to:
    - approximate the joint distribution
      (e.g., to generate a histogram of the
      distribution)
    - approximate the marginal distribution of
      one of the variables, or some subset of
      the variables (for example, the unknown
      parameters or latent variables)
    - compute an integral (such as the
      expected value of one of the variables).

    Typically, some of the variables
    correspond to observations whose values
    are known, and hence do not need to be
    sampled.

    Commonly used as a means of statistical
    inference, especially Bayesian inference.

    An alternative to deterministic algorithms
    for statistical inference such as the EM
    algorithm.


    As a result, care must be taken if
    independent samples are desired.

    Generally, samples from the beginning of
    the chain (the burn-in period) may not
    accurately represent the desired
    distribution and are usually discarded.

    It has been shown, however, that using a
    longer chain instead (e.g. a chain that is
    n times as long as the initially
    considered chain using a thinning factor
    of n) leads to better estimates of the
    true posterior.

    Thus, thinning should only be applied when
    time or computer memory are restricted.

probability
    [#AI]

    Used in 2 major ways:
    - reasoning for AI
    - analysis of proposed AI behaviour

    Used in 2 major ways:
    - The laws of probability tell us how AI
      systems should reason.

      We design our algorithms to compute or
      approximate various expressions derived
      using probability theory.

    - We can use probability and statistics to
      theoretically analyze the behavior of
      proposed AI systems.

probability theory vs information theory
    probability theory allows us to:
    - make uncertain statements
    - reason in the presence of uncertainty

    information theory enables us to:
    - quantify the amount of uncertainty in a
      probability distribution.

uncertainty
    ewwlinks +/"There are three possible sources of uncertainty:" "https://www.adhiraiyan.org/deeplearning/03.00-Probability-and-Information-Theory"

    3 sources:
    - Inherent stochasticity
    - Incomplete observability
    - Incomplete modeling

    Inherent stochasticity:
        These are systems that have inherent
        randomness.

        Like using the python rand() function
        which outputs random numbers each time you
        run, or the dynamics of subatomic
        particles in quantum mechanics which are
        described as probabilistic in quantum
        mechanics.

    Incomplete observability:
        The best example for this is the Monty
        Hall problem, the one in the movie 21 Jim
        Sturgess gets asked, there are three doors
        and there’s a ferrari behind one door and
        the other two lead to a goat.

        Watch the scene to understand how to solve
        the Monty Hall problem.

        In this even though the contestant’s
        choice is deterministic, but from the
        contestant’s point of view the outcome is
        uncertain and deterministic systems appear
        to be stochastic when you can’t observe
        all the variables.

    Incomplete modeling:
        Spoiler Warning!

        Well, at the end of End Game, when
        Iron man snapped away all of Thanos’
        forces, (I know, still recovering from
        the scene), we are left to wonder what
        happened to Gamora right, was she
        snapped away because she was with
        Thanos’s forces initially or was she
        saved becuase she turned against
        Thanos.

        When we discard some information about the
        model the discarded information in this
        case whether Tony knew Gamora was good or
        bad results in an uncertainty in the
        model’s predictions, in this case we don’t
        know for certain if she is alive or not.

Huffman code
    [minimum-redundancy code]
Huffman encoding
    [entropy encoding method]

    A particular type of optimal prefix code
    that is commonly used for lossless data
    compression.

    The process of finding or using such a
    code proceeds by means of Huffman coding

    Output:
        A variable-length code table for
        encoding a source symbol (such as a
        character in a file).

    Derives this table from the estimated
    probability or frequency of occurrence
    (weight) for each possible value of the
    source symbol.

    As a "Entropy encoding method":
        More common symbols are generally
        represented using fewer bits than less
        common symbols.

    Huffman's method can be efficiently
    implemented, finding a code in time linear
    to the number of input weights if these
    weights are sorted.

    However, although optimal among methods
    encoding symbols separately, Huffman
    coding is not always optimal among all
    compression methods.

hierarchical softmax
    A replacement for softmax which is must
    faster to evaluate.

    softmax               O(n)
    hierarchical softmax  O(log n)

Word2vec
    Can utilize either of two model
    architectures to produce a distributed
    representation of words:
    - continuous bag-of-words (CBOW), or
    - continuous skip-gram.

Negative Sampling
    [#word2vec]

    http://mccormickml.com/2017/01/11/word2vec-tutorial-part-2-negative-sampling/

    Modify the optimization objective with a
    technique called “Negative Sampling”,
    which causes each training sample to
    update only a small percentage of the
    model’s weights.

    It’s worth noting that subsampling
    frequent words and applying Negative
    Sampling not only reduced the compute
    burden of the training process, but also
    improved the quality of their resulting
    word vectors as well.

Representation learning
feature learning
    [set of techniques]

    Allows a system to automatically discover
    the representations needed for feature
    detection or classification from raw data.

    This replaces manual feature engineering
    and allows a machine to both learn the
    features and use them to perform a
    specific task.

    Motivated by the fact that ML tasks such
    as classification often require input that
    is mathematically and computationally
    convenient to process.

    However, real-world data such as images,
    video, and sensor data has not yielded to
    attempts to algorithmically define
    specific features.

    An alternative is to discover such
    features or representations through
    examination, without relying on explicit
    algorithms.

    Either supervised or unsupervised.

    Supervised:
    - Features are learned using labeled input
      data.

      Examples:
      - supervised neural networks,
      - multilayer perceptron, and
      - (supervised) dictionary learning.

    Unsupervised:
    - Features are learned with unlabeled
      input data.

      Examples:
      - dictionary learning,
      - independent component analysis,
      - autoencoders,
      - matrix factorization, and
      - various forms of clustering.

hierarchical representations
    Poincaré Embeddings for Learning
    Hierarchical Representations

Hierarchical clustering
Hierarchical cluster analysis
    [algorithm]

    Groups similar objects into groups called
    clusters.

    The endpoint is a set of clusters, where
    each cluster is distinct from each other
    cluster, and the objects within each
    cluster are broadly similar to each other.

hierarchical classification
    A useful approach for predicting thousands
    of possible categories.

    Deals with multi-class classification
    problems.

hierarchical softmax
    A Word2vec model can be trained with
    hierarchical softmax and/or negative
    sampling.

    To approximate the conditional log-
    likelihood a model seeks to maximize, the
    hierarchical softmax method uses a Huffman
    tree to reduce calculation.

    The negative sampling method, on the other
    hand, approaches the maximization problem
    by minimizing the log-likelihood of
    sampled negative instances.

    According to the authors, hierarchical
    softmax works better for infrequent words
    while negative sampling works better for
    frequent words and better with low
    dimensional vectors.

    As training epochs increase, hierarchical
    softmax stops being useful.

Probability Density Function
PDF
    A function that allows you to query (using
    the integral) the probability of a random
    variable taking a value between 2 limits.

    Example:
        Draw an inch vs probability graph.

        https://youtu.be/Fvi9A_tEmXQ?t=162

        What is the probability that X is
        exactly equal to 2 inches?
        0, of course.

        But, you can say:
        What is the probability that X is
        between 1 and 2 inches?

        This makes sense.

PDF and CDF
    Can take on both discrete and continuous
    forms.

Cumulative Distribution Function
CDF
    The integral of the PDF.

    Tells us the probability that a random
    variable is less than a certain value.

    Example:
        When referring to discrete variables, such
        as a six-sided die, we would have a graph
        resembling a staircase.

        Each upward step would have ⅙ of the value
        + the previous probability.

        By the end, the sixth step would be at
        100%.

        This states that each discrete variable
        has a ⅙ chance of rolling face up and at
        the end, there is a total of 100% (which
        it should always end with either 1-100%).

least squares
    [method]

    A standard approach in regression analysis
    to approximate the solution of
    overdetermined systems, i.e., sets of
    equations in which there are more
    equations than unknowns.

    "Least squares" means that the overall
    solution minimizes the sum of the squares
    of the residuals made in the results of
    every single equation.

    The most important application is in data
    fitting.

principle of least squares
    Minimizing the sum of the squares of the
    differences between the observed dependent
    variable (values of the variable being
    predicted) in the given dataset and those
    predicted by the linear function.

    ewwlinks +/"1.1.1. Ordinary Least Squares" "https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/linear_model.html#ordinary-least-squares"

    The coefficient estimates for Ordinary
    Least Squares rely on the independence of
    the features.

    When features are correlated and the
    columns of the design matrix \(X\) have
    an approximate linear dependence, the
    design matrix becomes close to singular
    and as a result, the least-squares
    estimate becomes highly sensitive to
    random errors in the observed target,
    producing a large variance.

    This situation of multicollinearity can
    arise, for example, when data are
    collected without an experimental design.

    Used for:
        Estimating the unknown parameters in a
        linear regression model.

    function of a set of explanatory variables

    Is there some idea inside map and filter
    that can be made more reusable?

    We have map and filter on collections, on
    streams, observables, etc.

    By recasting the core logic of sequence
    processing functions as process
    transformations, we can.

    What kinds of processes can be modelled
    this way?
    - ones that can be defined in terms of a
      succession of steps
    - where each step ingests an input
    - building a collection is just one
      instance
    - seeded left reduce is the generalization

    Independent from the context of their
    input.

    Output sources and specify only the
    essence of the transformation in terms of
    an individual element.

    Decoupled from input or output sources.

    Therefore, they can be used in many
    different processes - collections,
    streams, channels, observables, etc.

    Compose directly, without awareness of
    input or creation of intermediate
    aggregates.

Great Filter
    [#Fermi paradox]
    [concept]

    Whatever prevents dead matter from
    undergoing abiogenesis, in time, to
    expanding lasting life as measured by the
    Kardashev scale.

    Originates in Robin Hanson's argument that
    the failure to find any extraterrestrial
    civilizations in the observable universe
    implies the possibility something is wrong
    with one or more of the arguments from
    various scientific disciplines that the
    appearance of advanced intelligent life is
    probable; this observation is
    conceptualized in terms of a "Great
    Filter" which acts to reduce the great
    number of sites where intelligent life
    might arise to the tiny number of
    intelligent species with advanced
    civilizations actually observed (currently
    just one: human).

    This probability threshold, which could
    lie behind us (in our past) or in front of
    us (in our future), might work as a
    barrier to the evolution of intelligent
    life, or as a high probability of self-
    destruction.

    The main counter-intuitive conclusion of
    this observation is that the easier it was
    for life to evolve to our stage, the
    bleaker our future chances probably are.

odds ratio
OR
    [statistic]

    Quantifies the strength of the association
    between two events, A and B.

    The ratio of the odds of A in the presence
    of B and the odds of A in the absence of
    B.

    A and B are interchangeable.

    Two events are independent if and only if
    the OR equals 1:
        the odds of one event are the same in
        either the presence or absence of the
        other event.

    If the OR is greater than 1, then A and B
    are associated (correlated) in the sense
    that, compared to the absence of B, the
    presence of B raises the odds of A, and
    symmetrically the presence of A raises the
    odds of B.

    Conversely, if the OR is less than 1, then
    A and B are negatively correlated, and the
    presence of one event reduces the odds of
    the other event.

Apache Hadoop
    A collection of open-source software
    utilities that facilitate using a network
    of many computers to solve problems
    involving massive amounts of data and
    computation.

    It provides a software framework for
    distributed storage and processing of big
    data using the MapReduce programming
    model.

Hadoop Distributed File System
HDFS
Hadoop File System
    The primary data storage system used by
    Hadoop applications.

    It employs a NameNode and DataNode
    architecture to implement a distributed
    file system that provides high-performance
    access to data across highly scalable
    Hadoop clusters.

RDD
Resilient Distributed Dataset
    [#spark]

    https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/rdd-programming-guide.html

    The main abstraction Spark provides.

    A collection of elements partitioned
    across the nodes of the cluster that can
    be operated on in parallel.

    Created by starting with a file in the
    Hadoop file system (or any other
    Hadoop-supported file system), or an
    existing Scala collection in the driver
    program, and transforming it.

    Users may also ask Spark to persist an RDD
    in memory, allowing it to be reused
    efficiently across parallel operations.

    Finally, RDDs automatically recover from
    node failures.

DataFrame
    [#spark]

    A distributed collection of rows under
    named columns.

    - Can handle petabytes of data.

    Conceptually equivalent to:
    - a table in a relational database,
    - a data frame in R/Python, but with
      richer optimizations under the hood.

    Can be constructed from a wide array of
    sources such as:
    - structured data files,
    - tables in Hive,
    - external databases, or
    - existing RDDs.

    It also shares some common characteristics
    with RDD:
    - __Immutable in nature__ :
      We can create DataFrame / RDD once but
      can’t change it. And we can transform a
      DataFrame / RDD after applying
      transformations.

    - __Lazy Evaluations__:
      Which means that a task is not executed
      until an action is performed.

    - __Distributed__:
      RDD and DataFrame both are distributed in
      nature.

    Advantages:
    - Designed for processing large collection
      of structured or semi-structured data.

    - Observations in Spark DataFrame are
      organised under named columns, which
      helps Apache Spark to understand the
      schema of a DataFrame. This helps Spark
      optimize execution plan on these
      queries.

    - DataFrame in Apache Spark has the
      ability to handle petabytes of data.

    - DataFrame has a support for wide range
      of data format and sources.

    - It has API support for different
      languages like Python, R, Scala, Java.

Regular expressions
    Describe regular languages in formal
    language theory.

    They have the same expressive power as
    regular grammars.

regular language
rational language
    [formal language]

    Can be expressed using a regular
    expression, in the strict sense of the
    latter notion used in theoretical computer
    science (as opposed to many regular
    expressions engines provided by modern
    programming languages, which are augmented
    with features that allow recognition of
    languages that cannot be expressed by a
    classic regular expression).

    Alternatively, a regular language can be
    defined as a language recognized by a
    finite automaton.

    The equivalence of regular expressions and
    finite automata is known as Kleene's
    theorem[3] (after American mathematician
    Stephen Cole Kleene).

    In the Chomsky hierarchy, regular
    languages are defined to be the languages
    that are generated by Type-3 grammars
    (regular grammars).

    Regular languages are very useful in input
    parsing and programming language design.

query plan
query execution plan
    An ordered set of steps used to access
    data in a SQL relational database
    management system.

    This is a specific case of the relational
    model concept of access plans.

    Since SQL is declarative, there are
    typically a large number of alternative
    ways to execute a given query, with widely
    varying performance.

    When a query is submitted to the database,
    the query optimizer evaluates some of the
    different, correct possible plans for
    executing the query and returns what it
    considers the best option.

    Because query optimizers are imperfect,
    database users and administrators
    sometimes need to manually examine and
    tune the plans produced by the optimizer
    to get better performance.

lintscore
    http://proselint.com/lintscore/

    Evaluate the linter's performance.

    We want to have a linter that catches many
    errors, but which takes false alarms
    seriously.

    Better to say nothing than to say the
    wrong thing.

    And the harm from saying the wrong thing
    is greater than the benefit of having said
    the right thing.

    Thus our score metric is defined as

        T (T / (F + T))^k,

    where T is the number of true positives
    (hits), F is the number of false positives
    (false alarms), and k > 0 is a temperature
    parameter that determines the penalty for
    imprecision.

    In general, we choose as large a value of
    k as we can stomach, one that strongly
    discourages the creation of rules that
    can't be trusted.

    Suppose that k = 2.

    Then if the linter detects 100 errors, of
    which 10 are false positives, the score is
    72.9.

Vector quantisation
VQ
    A classical quantization technique from

    point, as in k-means and some other
    clustering algorithms.

    The assignment of one code word to a group
    of two or more picture elements.

    Secreted by the posterior lobe of the
    pituitary gland, a pea-sized structure at
    the base of the brain.

    It's sometimes known as the "cuddle
    hormone" or the "love hormone," because it
    is released when people snuggle up or bond
    socially.

pituitary gland
    A part of your endocrine system.

    Its main function is to secrete hormones
    into your bloodstream.

endocrine system
    A chemical messenger system comprising
    feedback loops of hormones released by
    internal glands of an organism directly
    into the circulatory system, regulating
    distant target organs.

    In humans, the major endocrine glands are
 f   the thyroid gland and the adrenal glands.

random walk
    After 'n' steps, the expected distance from
    where we started is proportional to the
    square root of 'n'.

L2 norm
Euclidean norm
    l2(v) = ||v||2.

    Calculates the distance of the vector
    coordinate from the origin of the vector
    space.

    As such, it is also known as the Euclidean
    norm as it is calculated as the Euclidean
    distance from the origin.

    The result is a positive distance value.

entropic gravity
emergent gravity
    [#modern physics]
    [theory]

    Describes gravity as an entropic force and
    not a fundamental interaction.

    At its simplest, the theory holds that
    when gravity becomes vanishingly
    weak—levels seen only at interstellar
    distances—it diverges from its classically
    understood nature and its strength begins
    to decay linearly with distance from a
    mass.

Quantum Darwinism
    In the past, physicists tended to view the
    classical and quantum worlds as being
    divided by an abrupt barrier that makes a
    fundamental distinction between the
    familiar macroscopic (classical) and the
    unfamiliar microscopic (quantum) realms.

    But in recent decades that view has
    changed.

    Many experts now think that the transition
    is gradual, and that the definite
    classical states we measure come from
    probabilistic quantum states progressively
    (although very quickly) losing their
    coherence as they become ever more
    entangled with their environment.

    Quantum Darwinism, put forward by Wojciech
    Zurek of Los Alamos National Laboratory in
    New Mexico, argues that the classical
    states we perceive are robust quantum
    states that can survive entanglement
    during decoherence.

    His theoretical framework posits that the
    information about these states will be
    duplicated many times and disseminated
    throughout the environment.

    Just as natural selection tells us that
    the fittest individuals in a species must
    survive to reproduce in great numbers and
    so go on to shape evolution, the fittest
    quantum states will be copied and appear
    classical.

    This redundancy means that many individual
    observers will measure any given state as
    having the same value, so ensuring
    objective reality.

    search tree in that a node can have more
    than two children.

3-manifold
    A space that locally looks like Euclidean

    small enough observer, all 3-manifolds
    look like our universe does to a small
    enough observer.

TLA+
Temporal Logic of Actions
    A formal specification language.

    It is used to design, model, document, and
    verify concurrent systems.

    TLA+ has been described as exhaustively-
    testable pseudocode, and its use likened
    to drawing blueprints for software
    systems.

    Less a programming language and more a
    systems modeling language.

    It's like writing a mathematical proof for
    your system where you describe each action
    the system takes, the invariants to
    describe "correctness" of the system and
    its state, and the TLA checker runs some
    kind of analysis of every possible state
    described by your model and that the
    invariants still hold true for all
    possible states.

    It's like running a unit test in parallel
    where all possible inputs are provided
    concurrently.

    Allows you to encode your system as a
    state machine, define invariants that must
    always be true, and the checker will
    explore your state machine and verify that
    the invariants are always true.

    An example would be encoding a distributed
    locking system, with an invariant saying
    "no lock is owned by more than 1 node at a
    time".

    You would encode all of the locking and
    unlocking behavior in your state machine,
    and then the checker would verify it.

asynchronous data stream

Functional reactive programming
Data-flow programming
FRP
    Reacting to data streams using the
    functional paradigm.

    Builds on the concepts of functional
    programming.

    Where functional programming applies to
    lists of elements, functional reactive
    programming is applied to streams of
    elements.

    The kinds of functions in functional
    programming, such as map, filter, and
    reduce all have analogues that can be
    applied to streams.

    In addition, functional reactive
    programming includes functions to split
    streams, create pipelines of operations to
    transform the data within a stream, and
    merge streams.

    Has been used for programming GUIs,
    robotics, games, and music, aiming to
    simplify these problems by explicitly
    modeling time.

antitrust
United States antitrust law
    In the United States, antitrust law is a
    collection of federal and state government
    laws that regulates the conduct and
    organization of business corporations,
    generally to promote competition for the
    benefit of consumers.

    An example of behavior that antitrust laws
    prohibit is lowering the price in a
    certain geographic area in order to push
    out the competition.

    For example, a large company sells widgets
    for $1.00 each throughout the country.

    Another company goes into business and
    sells widgets just in California or $.90
    each.

    In response, the first company lowers
    their prices just in California to $.80.

    They’re selling the widgets at a loss just
    in that state just to push out the new
    competitor.

    The second company goes out of business.

    Another example of an antitrust violation
    is collusion.

Energetics
energy economics
    The study of energy under transformation.

    Because energy flows at all scales, from
    the quantum level to the biosphere and

    discipline, encompassing for example
    thermodynamics, chemistry, biological
    energetics, biochemistry and ecological
    energetics.

    Where each branch of energetics begins and
    ends is a topic of constant debate.

    For example, Lehninger (1973, p. 21)
    contended that when the science of
    thermodynamics deals with energy exchanges
    of all types, it can be called energetics.

world line
worldline
    The world line (or worldline) of an object
    is the path that object traces in
    4-dimensional spacetime.

    It is an important concept in modern

    physics.

    The concept of a "world line" is
    distinguished from concepts such as an
    "orbit" or a "trajectory" (e.g., a
    planet's orbit in space or the trajectory
    of a car on a road) by the time dimension,
    and typically encompasses a large area of
    spacetime wherein perceptually straight
    paths are recalculated to show their
    (relatively) more absolute position
    states—to reveal the nature of special
    relativity or gravitational interactions.

   ‘(a . (b))’ represent the same list.
   Reading will accept any of the
   alternatives, but printing must choose one
   of them.

herd morality
morality of the herd
    [Nietzsche: Beyond Good and Evil]

    'Progress' becomes whatever moves a
    society towards a state where the herd has
    nothing to fear - the removal of
    dangerous, fearful things.

    If this actually happened, it would render
    morality redundant as the herd requires
    fear for its existence.

The black swan theory
theory of black swan events
    A metaphor that describes an event that
    comes as a surprise, has a major effect,
    and is often inappropriately rationalised
    after the fact with the benefit of
    hindsight. The term is based on an ancient
    saying that presumed black swans did not
    exist – a saying that became reinterpreted
    to teach a different lesson after the
    first European encounter with them.

    The theory was developed by Nassim
    Nicholas Taleb to explain:
    - The disproportionate role of
      high-profile, hard-to-predict, and rare
      events that are beyond the realm of
      normal expectations in history, science,
      finance, and technology.
    - The non-computability of the probability
      of the consequential rare events using
      scientific methods (owing to the very
      nature of small probabilities).
    - The psychological biases that blind
      people, both individually and
      collectively, to uncertainty and to a
      rare event's massive role in historical
      affairs.

    Taleb's "black swan theory" refers only to
    unexpected events of large magnitude and
    consequence and their dominant role in
    history. Such events, considered extreme
    outliers, collectively play vastly larger
    roles than regular occurrences.[1]:xxi
    More technically, in the scientific
    monograph "Silent Risk",[2] Taleb
    mathematically defines the black swan
    problem as "stemming from the use of
    degenerate metaprobability".[2]

turn-key system
    A computer system that has been customized
    for a particular application.

    The term derives from the idea that the
    end user can just turn a key and the
    system is ready to go.

    Turnkey systems include all the hardware
    and software necessary for the particular
    application.

Ballast tank
    A compartment within a boat, ship or other
    floating structure that holds water, which
    is used as ballast to provide stability
    for a vessel.

    Using water in a tank provides easier
    weight adjustment than the stone or iron
    ballast used in older vessels.

free surface effect
    A mechanism which can cause a watercraft
    to become unstable and capsize.

    It refers to the tendency of liquids — and
    of unbound aggregates of small solid
    objects, like seeds, gravel, or crushed
    ore, whose behavior approximates that of
    liquids — to move in response to changes
    in the attitude of a craft's cargo holds,
    decks, or liquid tanks in reaction to
    operator-induced motions (or sea states
    caused by waves and wind acting upon the
    craft).

    When referring to the free surface effect,
    the condition of a tank that is not full
    is described as a "slack tank", while a
    full tank is "pressed up".

halfway-house

    accelerated spin, via rapid acceleration
    transients.

Hermeneutic analysis
    https://koppa.jyu.fi/avoimet/hum/menetelmapolkuja/en/methodmap/data-analysis/hermeneutic-analysis

    A name for various methods of analysis,
    which are based on interpreting.

    The strategy forms an opposite to those
    research strategies which stress
    objectivity and independence of
    interpretations in the formation of
    knowledge.

    Hermeneutic research includes various
    different approaches.

    Methods of analysis may also vary, and in
    different disciplines discipline-specific
    methods exist for interpreting phenomena.

    Hermeneutic analysis enables you to elicit
    an in-depth understanding of meanings of,
    for example: human practices, culture,
    works of art and texts.

    Understanding is produced through
    systematic interpretation processes.

    These processes are known as a hermeneutic
    circle Interpretation of details affects
    the interpretation of the entire
    phenomenon; reviews of these
    interpretations produce a deepening
    understanding of the phenomenon.

    You can combine hermeneutic analysis with
    other methods of analysis that aim to
    interpret and understand meanings.

    A combination of the rules of hermeneutics
    and phenomenology forms phenomenological
    hermeneutic analysis.

    Hermeneutic analysis also forms the basis
    of various discipline-specific methods of
    analysis and close readings methods.

    word "Obeah" was historically not often
    used to describe one's own practices.

Karat
Gold karat
    A gold karat is 1/24 part, or 4.1667
    percent, of the whole, and the purity of a

life is a game of inches
    The King explains the meaning of the term
    Game of Inches when it comes to sports and
    regular day-to-day life.

    It refers to the reality that life can
    change dramatically based on things that
    are determined by the narrowest of
    margins.

    In terms of the football analogy, it also
    means that the people who are willing to
    fight for those extra couple of inches
    will usually come out ahead.

    For instance - let's say that you apply to
    go to an Ivy league school.

    Let's say that the top 1,000 students get
    in, and you were the next on the list to
    be accepted.

    Life is a "game of inches" in this case,
    as the circumstances of your life changed
    based on the narrowest of margins (not
    getting into Harvard).

    Now, in keeping with the football analogy
    - let's say that you really want to go to
    Harvard, so you go to a local college,
    work extremely hard for a year, post
    excellent grades and then transfer to
    Harvard later.

    This would be going the "extra couple of
    inches" to get what you want.

Broader impacts
Broader Impacts Statement
    The “potential [for your research] to

The Precession of Simulacra
    [#Simulacra and Simulation]

    Baudrillard believed that society had
    become so saturated with these simulacra
    and our lives so saturated with the
    constructs of society that all meaning was
    becoming meaningless by being infinitely
    mutable; he called this phenomenon the
    "precession of simulacra".

simulacrum
simulacra
    v +/"Simulation is no longer that of a territory, a" "$HOME/Calibre Library/Simulacra/(The Body, In Theory Histories of Cultural Materialism) Jean Baudrillard, Sheila Faria Glaser (17)/(The Body, In Theory Histories of Cultural - Simulacra.txt"

    A representation or imitation of a person
    or thing.

    The word was first recorded in the English
    language in the late 16th century, used to
    describe a representation, such as a
    statue or a painting, especially of a god.

    Something that replaces reality with its
    representation.

    Jean Baudrillard in "The Precession of
    Simulacra" defines this term as follows:
        "Simulation is no longer that of a
        territory, a referential being, or a
        substance.

        It is the generation by models of a
        real without origin or reality: a
        hyperreal."

    It is no longer a question of imitation,
    nor duplication, nor even parody.

    It is a question of substituting the signs
    of the real for the real" (1-2).

    His primary examples are psychosomatic
    illness, Disneyland, and Watergate.

    Fredric Jameson provides a similar
    definition: the simulacrum's "peculiar
    function lies in what Sartre would have
    called the derealization of the whole
    surrounding world of everyday reality"
    (34).

Simulacra and Simulation
    An 1981 philosophical treatise by the
    sociologist Jean Baudrillard, in which the
    author seeks to examine the relationships
    between reality, symbols, and society, in
    particular the significations and
    symbolism of culture and media involved in
    constructing an understanding of shared
    existence.

Olbers' paradox
dark night sky paradox
    The apparent paradox that if stars are
    distributed evenly throughout an infinite
    universe, the sky should be as bright by
    night as by day, since more distant stars
    would be fainter but more numerous.

    This is not the case because the universe
    is of finite age, and the light from the
    more distant stars is dimmed because they
    are receding from the observer as the
    universe expands.

    Named after the German astronomer Heinrich
    Wilhelm Olbers (1758–1840).

    The argument that the darkness of the
    night sky conflicts with the assumption of
    an infinite and eternal static universe.

The Astonishing Hypothesis
    https://youtu.be/D5in5EdjhD0?t=4615

    Consciousness comes from the activity of
    the brain.

    Crick, one of the co-discoverers of the
    molecular structure of DNA, later became a
    theorist for neurobiology and the study of
    the brain.

David Hume
    David Hume (; born David Home; 7 May 1711
    NS (26 April 1711 OS) – 25 August 1776)
    was a Scottish Enlightenment philosopher,
    historian, economist, librarian and
    essayist, who is best known today for his
    highly influential system of philosophical
    empiricism, skepticism, and naturalism.

    Beginning with A Treatise of Human Nature
    (1739–40), Hume strove to create a
    naturalistic science of man that examined
    the psychological basis of human nature.

    Hume argued against the existence of
    innate ideas, positing that all human
    knowledge derives solely from experience.

dunder
    Dunder is the liquid left in a boiler
    after distilling a batch of rum.

    It is a traditional flavor source used in
    the fermentation of the wash of Jamaican
    rum.

    Similar in process to sour mash in Bourbon
    whiskey, it is a crucial step in achieving
    an authentic rum flavor.

    In Europe, waste liquors from alcohol
    distillation are referred to as vinasse.

    Dunder contains many by-products that help
    in future fermentations, including dead
    yeast cells, which are an excellent yeast
    nutrient.

Adam Smith
    Adam Smith (c. 16 June [O.S. c. 5 June]
    1723 – 17 July 1790) was a Scottish
    economist, philosopher as well as a moral
    philosopher, a pioneer of political
    economy, and a key figure during the
    Scottish Enlightenment, also known as
    ''The Father of Economics'' or ''The
    Father of Capitalism''.

    Smith wrote two classic works, The Theory
    of Moral Sentiments (1759) and An Inquiry
    into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth
    of Nations (1776).

    The latter, often abbreviated as The
    Wealth of Nations, is considered his
    magnum opus and the first modern work of
    economics.

    In his work, Adam Smith introduced his
    theory of absolute advantage.

    Smith studied social philosophy at the
    University of Glasgow and at Balliol
    College, Oxford, where he was one of the
    first students to benefit from
    scholarships set up by fellow Scot John
    Snell.

    After graduating, he delivered a
    successful series of public lectures at
    the University of Edinburgh, leading him
    to collaborate with David Hume during the
    Scottish Enlightenment.

    Smith obtained a professorship at Glasgow,
    teaching moral philosophy and during this
    time, wrote and published The Theory of
    Moral Sentiments.

    In his later life, he took a tutoring
    position that allowed him to travel
    throughout Europe, where he met other
    intellectual leaders of his day.

    Smith laid the foundations of classical
    free market economic theory.

    The Wealth of Nations was a precursor to
    the modern academic discipline of
    economics.

    In this and other works, he developed the
    concept of division of labour and
    expounded upon how rational self-interest
    and competition can lead to economic
    prosperity.

    Smith was controversial in his own day and
    his general approach and writing style
    were often satirised by writers such as
    Horace Walpole.

Francis Crick
    Francis Harry Compton Crick (8 June 1916 –
    28 July 2004) was a British molecular
    biologist, biophysicist, and
    neuroscientist.
    
    He, James Watson, and Rosalind Franklin
    played a crucial role in deciphering the
    helical structure of the DNA molecule.
    
    Crick and Watson's paper in Nature in 1953
    laid the groundwork for understanding DNA
    structure and functions.
    
    Together with Maurice Wilkins, they were
    jointly awarded the 1962 Nobel Prize in
    Physiology or Medicine "for their
    discoveries concerning the molecular
    structure of nucleic acids and its
    significance for information transfer in
    living material".
    
    Crick was an important theoretical
    molecular biologist and played a crucial
    role in research related to revealing the
    helical structure of DNA.
    
    He is widely known for the use of the term
    "central dogma" to summarise the idea that
    once information is transferred from
    nucleic acids (DNA or RNA) to proteins, it
    cannot flow back to nucleic acids.
    
    In other words, the final step in the flow
    of information from nucleic acids to
    proteins is irreversible.
    
    During the remainder of his career, he
    held the post of J.W. Kieckhefer
    Distinguished Research Professor at the
    Salk Institute for Biological Studies in
    La Jolla, California.
    
    His later research centered on theoretical
    neurobiology and attempts to advance the
    scientific study of human consciousness.
    
    He remained in this post until his death;
    "he was editing a manuscript on his death
    bed, a scientist until the bitter end"
    according to Christof Koch.

cartesian rationalism
Cartesianism
    A form of rationalism because it holds
    that scientific knowledge can be derived a
    priori from 'innate ideas' through
    deductive reasoning. 

    The Cartesian Method is the philosophical
    and scientific system of René Descartes
    and its subsequent development by other
    seventeenth century thinkers, most notably
    François Poullain de la Barre, Nicolas
    Malebranche and Baruch Spinoza.
    
    Descartes is often regarded as the first
    thinker to emphasize the use of reason to
    develop the natural sciences.
    
    For him, the philosophy was a thinking
    system that embodied all knowledge, and
    expressed it in this way:Aristotle and St.
    Augustine’s work influenced Descartes's
    cogito argument.
    
    Additionally, there is similarity between
    Descartes’s work and that of the Scottish
    philosopher, George Campbell’s 1776
    publication, titled Philosophy of
    Rhetoric.
    
    In his Meditations on First Philosophy he
    writes, “[b]ut what then am I?
    
    A thing which thinks.
    
    What is a thing which thinks?
    
    It is a thing which doubts, understands,
    [conceives], affirms, denies, wills,
    refuses, which also imagines and feels.
    
    "Cartesians view the mind as being wholly
    separate from the corporeal body.
    
    Sensation and the perception of reality
    are thought to be the source of untruth
    and illusions, with the only reliable
    truths to be had in the existence of a
    metaphysical mind.
    
    Such a mind can perhaps interact with a
    physical body, but it does not exist in
    the body, nor even in the same physical
    plane as the body.
    
    The question of how mind and body interact
    would be a persistent difficulty for
    Descartes and his followers, with
    different Cartesians providing different
    answers.
    
    To this point Descartes wrote, "we should
    conclude from all this, that those things
    which we conceive clearly and distinctly
    as being diverse substances, as we regard
    mind and body to be, are really substances
    essentially distinct one from the other;
    and this is the conclusion of the Sixth
    Meditation."
    
    Therefore, we can see that, while mind and
    body are indeed separate, because they can
    be separated from each other, but,
    Descartes realizes, the mind is a whole,
    inseparable from itself, while the body
    can become separated from itself to some
    extent, as in when one loses an arm or a
    leg.

    but would not be viewed as sacred.
    
    Nonetheless, some things can be both holy
    and sacred, such as the Holy Bible.
