POSITION()
    [legacy function]

    I try to translate a legacy query into a standard SQL query in
    bigquery, but I don't find the function position() in standard SQL.

    vim +/"POSITION(alternate_bases) AS alt," "$MYGIT/googlegenomics/bigquery-examples/1000genomes/sql/allelic-frequency-by-ethnicity.sql"
