epistemology
    The branch of philosophy concerned with
    knowledge.
    
    Epistemologists study the nature, origin,
    and scope of knowledge, epistemic
    justification, the rationality of belief,
    and various related issues.
    
    Epistemology is considered a major
    subfield of philosophy, along with other
    major subfields such as ethics, logic, and
    metaphysics.

    The theory of knowledge, especially with
    regard to its methods, validity, and
    scope, and the distinction between
    justified belief and opinion.

    The introspective or reflective
    apprehension by the mind of its own inner
    states"

reflexivity
    [#epistemology]
    [#sociology of knowledge]
    [social theory]

    Refers to circular relationships between
    cause and effect, especially as embedded
    in human belief structures.

skepticism
scepticism
    Generally a questioning attitude or doubt
    towards one or more putative instances of
    knowledge which are asserted to be mere

reflexivity
    [#epistemology]
    [#sociology of knowledge]

    Refers to circular relationships between
    cause and effect, especially as embedded
    in human belief structures.

    Generally refers to the examination of
    one's own beliefs, judgments and practices
    during the research process and how these
    may have influenced the research.

    If positionality refers to what we know
    and believe then reflexivity is about what
    we do with this knowledge.
