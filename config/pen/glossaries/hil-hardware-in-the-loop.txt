HIL
    Facts
    - A HIL simulator includes sophisticated
      mathematical models of actuators,
      dynamics and sensors

    - A HIL simulator constitutes a “virtual
      world” for the control system

    - HIL testing is performed in a safe test
      bed, without risk to people, equipment
      or environment

    - HIL testing is black-box testing

    - No source code is revealed or exposed
      through HIL testing

    - HIL testing is the de facto industry
      standard for control system software in
      the automotive and aerospace industries

    - Every vessel is unique regarding
      equipment and configuration, increasing
      the potential for errors

    Their modeling standards now make up most
    of the modeling standards in the world:
    - UML
    - SysML

DDS
    $MYGIT/objectcomputing/OpenDDS

    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_Distribution_Service

    An OMG machine-to-machine (sometimes
    called middleware or connectivity
    framework) standard that aims to enable
    dependable, high-performance,
    interoperable, real-time, scalable data
    exchanges using a publish–subscribe
    pattern.

    DDS addresses the needs of applications
    like aerospace and defense, air-traffic
    control, autonomous vehicles, medical
    devices, robotics, power generation,
    simulation and testing, smart grid
    management, transportation systems, and
    other applications that require real-time
    data exchange.

Real time system
    The system is subjected to real time,
    i.e., response should be guaranteed within
    a specified timing constraint or system
    should meet the specified deadline.
    
    For example: flight control system, real
    time monitors etc.

control system
    A set of mechanical or electronic devices
    that regulates other devices or systems by
    way of control loops.
    
    Typically, control systems are
    computerized.
    
    Control systems are a central part of
    industry and of automation.

Hardware-in-the-loop testing
HIL testing
    An efficient black-box method for testing
    and verifying control system software. 

    Accomplished by isolating the control
    system and its operator stations from its
    surroundings, and replacing all actual I/O
    with simulated I/O from a HIL simulator in
    real time.
    
    The HIL simulator imitates the vessel,
    vessel systems and environment, responds
    to the commands from the control system in
    a realistic manner, and provides realistic
    and consistent measurements.
    
    The control system cannot sense any
    difference between the real world and the
    virtual world in the HIL simulator.
    
    The HIL simulator thereby facilitates
    systematic testing of control system
    design philosophy, functionality,
    performance, and failure handling
    capability, both in normal and off-design
    operating conditions.

control system
    Interacts with vessel systems through a
    set of input/output (I/O) signals.
    
    Input is provided by sensors that measure
    dynamic states and parameters, as well as
    by operator stations and other control
    systems.
    
    Based on the input and internal models in
    the control system, the control system
    calculates control signal output to the
    actuators.
