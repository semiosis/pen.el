turbulence
turbulent flow
    [fluid dynamics]

    Fluid motion characterized by chaotic
    changes in pressure and flow velocity.
    
    It is in contrast to a laminar flow, which
    occurs when a fluid flows in parallel
    layers, with no disruption between those
    layers.

Navier-Stokes equations
    [fluid mechanics]

    A set of partial differential equations
    that describes the flow of incompressible
    fluids.
    
    The equation is a generalization of the
    equation devised by Swiss mathematician
    Leonhard Euler in the 18th century to
    describe the flow of incompressible and
    frictionless fluids.

    Govern all fluid flow including turbulence
    but they are notoriously difficult to
    solve.

Reynolds Number
Re
    [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtIhVwPruwY][Reynolds Number - Numberphile - YouTube]]

    An important dimensionless quantity in
    fluid mechanics used to help predict flow
    patterns in different fluid flow
    situations.
    
    At low Reynolds numbers, flows tend to be
    dominated by laminar (sheet-like) flow,
    while at high Reynolds numbers turbulence
    results from differences in the fluid's
    speed and direction, which may sometimes
    intersect or even move counter to the
    overall direction of the flow (eddy
    currents).

laminar flow
    [#fluid dynamics]

    A flow regime characterized by high
    momentum diffusion and low momentum
    convection.
    
    When a fluid is flowing through a closed
    channel such as a pipe or between two flat
    plates, either of two types of flow may
    occur depending on the velocity and
    viscosity of the fluid: laminar flow or
    turbulent flow.

    Characterized by fluid particles following
    smooth paths in layers, with each layer
    moving smoothly past the adjacent layers
    with little or no mixing.
    
    At low velocities, the fluid tends to flow
    without lateral mixing, and adjacent
    layers slide past one another like playing
    cards.

vortex street
Kármán vortex street
    [fluid dynamics]

    A repeating pattern of swirling vortices,
    caused by a process known as vortex
    shedding, which is responsible for the
    unsteady separation of flow of a fluid
    around blunt bodies.

currents
    General patterns of ocean flow are called
    currents.

eddy
    Sometimes a current can pinch off sections
    and create circular currents of water
    called an eddy.
