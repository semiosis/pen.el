websocket
    Basically a two way connection between a
    client and server.
    
    You would typically encounter one in any
    use case when you would want the server to
    send data to the browser without the
    browser requesting it first.

progressive enhancement
    A more sophisticated and at the same time
    stable way of assuring that
    
    but it takes more time and effort.

graceful degradation
    Can be used more easily as a patch for an
    already existing product; it means harder
    maintenance later on, but requires less
    initial work.
