Continuous Delivery for Machine Learning

    Automating the end-to-end lifecycle of ML
    applications.

    ML applications are becoming popular in
    our industry, however the process for
    developing, deploying, and continuously
    improving them is more complex compared to
    more traditional software, such as a web
    service or a mobile application.
    
    They are subject to change in three axis:
    the code itself, the model, and the data.
    
    Their behaviour is often complex and hard
    to predict, and they are harder to test,
    harder to explain, and harder to improve.
    
    Continuous Delivery for ML (CD4ML) is the
    discipline of bringing Continuous Delivery
    principles and practices to ML
    applications.
