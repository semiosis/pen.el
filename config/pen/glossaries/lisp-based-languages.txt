unwind-protect
    An analogue of finally clause in Java or
    Python, so it's not a catch-all clause,
    that will intercept any unhandled
    condition.

numeric tower
numerical tower
    In Scheme and in Lisp dialects inspired by
    it:

    The set of data types that represent
    numbers in a given programming language.

    Example:

        Integer
       Rational .
      Real       .
     Complex      .
    Number _______ .

LISP 2
    Functions and variables have separate
    namespaces.

    Examples:
    - LFE
      Lisp Flavored Erlang

Homoinconic
Homoinconicity
    The program structure is similar to its
    syntax, and therefore the program's
    internal representation can be inferred by
    reading the text's layout.

    Some inferences from the above:
    - A language that looks like the AST it
      compiles to.
    - data = code

attraction of Lisp in AI research
    https://www.quora.com/Would-Emacs-Lisp-be-a-good-start-in-learning-A-I

    The original attraction of Lisp in AI
    research was due to the fact that Lisp
    programs are lists (i.e., lists of
    instructions which can be treated like
    data) and so Lisp programs can be written
    (without much fuss) that rewrite
    themselves (e.g., in response to
    “learning”).
    
    Emacs Lisp is as good as any other
    implementation in that regard.
    
    And the fact that John McCarthy (the guy
    who gave us Lisp) was, probably, the first
    computer scientist to state the main
    problem of AI (i.e., the Qualification
    problem) also helped Lisp’s reputation as
    an AI tool.
    
    But AI has moved far beyond the simple
    idea that a “state of AI” would be
    achieved when programs could rewrite
    themselves.
    
    What became obvious was that the real
    problem of AI is in writing a program that
    knows what it needs to change about itself
    to improve itself (and so the ability of a
    program to rewrite itself becomes
    secondary).
    
    And, practically, modern AI research
    focuses on things (e.g., ML) that don’t
    require Lisp’s capabilities.
    
    Lisp is a fascinating language but it’s
    not necessary (or, in some ways,
    practical) for AI research (and I use it
    only to write modifications to Emacs).
