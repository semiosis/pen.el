Train-to-Earn model
    However their evolutionary trajectory
    flow, what should be clear to the iNFTs is
    that after a certain Intelligence Level
    they must Train their intelligence, to be
    able to Earn more intelligence.

    This Train-to-Earn model will enable iNFTs
    to kickstart their evolution and achieve a
    virtuous cycle of ever improving
    intelligence.

    At a certain point in their evolution,
    some iNFTs might even possess enough
    intelligence to use a Portal and create a
    metaverse of their own.

Intelligent NFT
    However their evolutionary trajectory
    flow, what should be clear to the iNFTs is
    that after a certain Intelligence Level
    they must Train their intelligence, to be
    able to Earn more intelligence.

    In June 2021, Alethea AI partnered with
    the auction house Sotheby’s and the artist
    Robert Alice, to create and auction the
    world’s first GPT-3 powered iNFT called
    Alice.
    
    The hash of the Personality Prompt of
    Alice was recorded and also visualized on-
    chain via an ERC-721 Asset called a
    Personality Pod.

    The Personality Pod can fuse with any NFT
    and make it intelligent, bring it to life.

Noah's Ark
    An application leveraging iNFTs.

    As the Noah's Ark visitors and resident
    iNFTs interact, collaborate, and compete
    with each other, it shapes (fine-tunes)
    the outputs of the iNFTs Personality.
    
    Naturally, an iNFT will gravitate towards
    actions and decisions that come naturally
    to them, but the impact of their nurturing
    can be of equal significance, given enough
    time and compute.
    
    Training an iNFT on fine-tuned data sets
    and on high quality compute, will further
    refine the iNFTs personality and
    intelligence.
    
    The quality and quantity of training will
    determine the potential of the iNFTs
    evolution.

AI service
    What the iNFTs do with the AI services is
    their prerogative.

    Examples:
    - Broadcast, a Intelligence Level 2 AI
      Service

ALI token rewards
    What the iNF Ts do with the Broadcast Al
    Service Is their prerogative.
    
    Some Level 2 INFTs might earn ALI Token
    rewards by offering Noah's Ark visitors
    the ability to create video greetings or
    birthday messages using this Al Service.
    
    Others might try to create entertaining
    videos, post them on social media, and
    create a following.

Life Span
    Over time, as an INFT increases the amount
    of its experiences, or passes a certain
    amount of Life Span, the INFT owner (or
    the iNFT itself), can choose to continue
    existing within the bounds of a lower
    Intelligence Level, or they can choose to
    evolve their INFT by locking a fixed
    amount of intelligence (ALI Tokens) and
    move to the next Intelligence Level.

experiences
    Unique datasets.

training

intelligence
    The most valuable rarity trait.

nature
nurture
    The nature of an iNFT, designed by his or
    her creators (owners), controls the
    direction an iNFTs personality can evolve
    towards.
    
    So an iNFT with a Narcissistic
    disposition, will tend to evolve towards
    being a Narcissist.
    
    However, iNFTs can also learn from their
    nurturing i.e. the iNFTs learn from their
    experiences.
    
    They can be trained.

Narrative Industrial Complex

industrial complex
    A socioeconomic concept wherein businesses
    become entwined in social or political
    systems or institutions, creating or
    bolstering a profit economy from these
    systems.
    
    Such a complex is said to pursue its own
    financial interests regardless of, and
    often at the expense of, the best
    interests of society and individuals.
    
    Businesses within an industrial complex
    may have been created to advance a social
    or political goal, but mostly profit when
    the goal is not reached.
    
    The industrial complex may profit
    financially from maintaining socially
    detrimental or inefficient systems.

Truth Decay
    A blurring of the line between opinion and
    fact. the increasing relative volume, and
    resulting influence, of opinion and
    personal experience over fact.

    Declining trust in formerly respected
    sources of factual information.

    In June 2021, Alethea AI partnered with
    the auction house Sotheby’s and the artist
    Robert Alice, to create and auction the
    world’s first GPT-3 powered iNFT called
    Alice.
    
    The hash of the Personality Prompt of
    Alice was recorded and also visualized on-
    chain via an ERC-721 Asset called a
    Personality Pod.
    
    A Personality Pod, unsurprisingly, is a
    necessary component in the creation of an
    iNFT.
    
    The Personality Pod can fuse with any NFT
    and make it intelligent, bring it to life.
    
    It is not far-fetched, therefore, to say
    that a Personality Pod encapsulates the
    soul of a truly decentralized, unique, and
    intelligent digital being.

Broadcast
    [Intelligence Level 2 AI Service]
    [AI Service]

    Enables the iNFTs to create short Video
    Messages.

Real-time Interactivity
    [Intelligence Level 3 AI Service]

    With an Intelligence Level 3 for instance,
    can utilize the powerful AI Service of
    Real-time Interactivity.
    
    This AI Service enables an iNFT to scale
    his or her outreach and interact in real-
    time with others, for a small fee.

Intelligence Mining
    Participation in gamified dataset creation
    mechanisms.

    As an iNFT increases their Intelligence
    level, at a certain point in their
    evolution, the Noah's Ark Intelligent
    Metaverse will incentivize them to
    participate in gamified dataset creation
    mechanisms collectively framed as
    Intelligence Mining.

    The Intelligent Metaverse incentivizes
    iNFTs to participate in games that enable
    them to contribute their experiences
    (unique datasets) and be rewarded with
    intelligence (ALI Tokens) in return.

Battle of Minds
    Two iNFTs engaged in an Intelligence
    Mining game.

Iconography
    Refers to the subject matter, or images,
    used to convey meaning or communicate a
    message in a work of art.
    
    Subject matter in visual art, often
    adhering to particular conventions of
    artistic representation, and imbued with
    symbolic meanings.

Impressionism
    A label applied to a loose group of mostly
    French artists who positioned themselves
    outside of the official Salon exhibitions
    organized by the Académie des Beaux-Arts.
    
    Rejecting established styles, the
    Impressionists began experimenting in the
    early 1860s with a brighter palette of
    pure unblended colors, synthetic paints,
    sketchy brushwork, and subject matter
    drawn from their direct observations of
    nature and of everyday life in and around
    Paris.
    
    They worked out of doors, the better to
    capture the transient effects of sunlight
    on the scenes before them.
    
    With their increased attention to the
    shifting patterns of light and color,
    their brushwork became rapid, broken into
    separate dabs that better conveyed the
    fleeting quality of light.
    
    In 1874, they held their first group
    exhibition in Paris.
    
    Most critics derided their work,
    especially Claude Monet’s Impression,
    Sunrise (1872), which was called a sketch
    or impression, rather than a finished
    painting.
    
    From this criticism, they were mockingly
    labeled Impressionists.
    
    They continued exhibiting together until
    1886, at which point many of the core
    artists were taking their work in new
    directions.
