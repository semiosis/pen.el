empirical research
    Research using empirical evidence.
    
    It is also a way of gaining knowledge by
    means of direct and indirect observation
    or experience.
    
    Empiricism values some research more than
    other kinds.
    
    Empirical evidence can be analyzed
    quantitatively or qualitatively.

research
    Can be divided into three different
    categories; exploratory, descriptive and
    causal.

exploratory research
    Research conducted for a problem that has
    not been studied more clearly, intended to
    establish priorities, develop operational
    definitions and improve the final research
    design.
    
    Exploratory research helps determine the
    best research design, data-collection
    method and selection of subjects.

causal research
explanatory research
    The investigation of (research into)
    cause-and-effect relationships.
    
    To determine causality, it is important to
    observe variation in the variable assumed
    to cause the change in the other
    variable(s), and then measure the changes
    in the other variable(s).

conclusive research
    The difference between exploratory and
    conclusive research is drawn by Sandhursen
    (2000) in a way that exploratory studies
    result in a range of causes and
    alternative options for a solution of a
    specific problem, whereas, conclusive
    studies identify the final information
    that is the only solution to an existing
    research problem.

descriptive research
    Defined as a research method that
    describes the characteristics of the
    population or phenomenon that is being
    studied.
    
    This methodology focuses more on the
    “what” of the research subject rather than
    the “why” of the research subject.

citation

    unpublished source that you consulted and
    obtained information from while writing
