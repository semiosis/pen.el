BullseyeCoverage
    Code analyzer for C and C++ that evaluates
    how much of your source code was tested.
    
    It’s used to improve the quality of
    software in vital systems, such as those
    in enterprise applications, medical,
    industrial control, communications,
    aerospace, and defense.
    
    It works with anything you can write in C
    and C++, including system-level and kernel
    mode.

Conan
    [package manager for c++]

    - decentralized
    - client-server architecture

    Clients can fetch packages from, as well
    as upload packages to, different servers
    (“remotes”), similar to the “git” push-
    pull model to/from git remotes.

    On a high level, the servers are just
    package storage.
    
    They do not build nor create the packages.
    
    The packages are created by the client,
    and if binaries are built from sources,
    that compilation is also done by the
    client application.
