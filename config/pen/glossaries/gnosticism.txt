Sabaoth
Sabaoth the good
    [#pistis sophia]

    https://www.gnosticdoctrine.com/2020/06/sabaoth-good.html

    Lord of Hosts

    Firstly, Sabaoth the Good is the power of
    the Light-emanations.

    The name Sabaoth comes from the Hebrew
    word for "hosts" or "forces," particularly
    in the expression "Adonai Sabaoth," lord
    of hosts. Sabaoth plays a similar role in
    Pistis Sophia.

demiurge
Yaldabaoth
Jaldabaoth
Ildabaoth
    The son of Sophia, the personification of
    wisdom in Gnosticism, with whom he
    contends.
    
    By creatively turning to matter in
    goodness and simplicity, Sophia created
    the imperfect Yaldabaoth, the son of
    Chaos, without the knowledge of the other
    aeons.

    A being responsible for the creation of
    the universe.

    (Platonic philosophy)
    The Maker or Creator of the world.

    (Gnosticism and other theological systems)
    A heavenly being, subordinate to the
    Supreme Being, that is considered to be
    the controller of the material world and
    antagonistic to all that is purely
    spiritual.

    An evil deity and creator of the material
    world in various Gnostic sects and
    movements, sometimes represented as a
    theriomorphic, lion-headed serpent.
    
    He is regarded as the Demiurge and false
    god who keeps the souls trapped in
    physical bodies, imprisoned in the
    material universe.
    
    The name is probably derived from the
    Aramaic expression yaldā bahôt (Imperial
    Aramaic: ילדא בהות), which means
    "descendant of Chaos" or "son of Chaos".

Five Seals
    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_Seals

    Typically described as a baptismal rite
    involving a series of five full immersions
    in holy running or "living water,"
    symbolizing spiritual ascension to the
    divine realm.
    
    The Five Seals are frequently mentioned in
    various Sethian Gnostic texts from the Nag
    Hammadi library.

    At the end of the Apocryphon of John, the
    Five Seals are described as protecting
    against death.
    
    I raised and sealed the person in luminous
    water with Five Seals, that death might
    not prevail over the person from that
    moment on.
    
    This quote has a parallel in Saying 19 of
    the Coptic Gospel of Thomas, attributed to
    Jesus.
    
    For there are five trees in paradise for
    you; they do not change, summer or winter,
    and their leaves do not fall.
    
    Whoever knows them will not taste death.

Innominable Father

The Great Ignorance
    [#Basilidians]
    [#Basilideans]

    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basilideans#Gospel

    When every part of the sonship has arrived
    above the Limitary Spirit, "then the
    creation shall find mercy, for till now it
    groans and is tormented and awaits the
    revelation of the sons of God, that all
    the men of the sonship may ascend from
    hence".
    
    When this has come to pass, God will bring
    upon the whole world the Great Ignorance,
    that everything may like being the way it
    is, and that nothing may desire anything
    contrary to its nature.
    
    "And in this wise shall be the
    Restoration, all things according to
    nature having been founded in the seed of
    the universe in the beginning, and being
    restored at their due seasons."

Agnostos Theos
The unknowable God
    This supreme divinity is Unmanifested
    Light, the Void, the Absolute.

    Everything is within the Absolute, but it
    is the unknowable mystery, except for the
    one that is an inhabitant of the Absolute,
    a paramatasaya.

Emanation and the Pleromatic Fall
    Pleroma means completely perfect.

    Creation, which is manifestation and
    therefore imperfection, unfolded from the
    the perfect unmanifest.

    In Kabbalah it is said that God wanted to
    become cognizant of his own happiness, so
    he unfolded into creation as a mirror to
    know himself.

    Pistis Sophia is a part of the Absolute
    who becomes fascinated by the false light
    of creation and falls, becoming lost and
    trapped within matter.

    Sophia is often depicted with
    characteristics of lost innocence, such as
    a young child lost in a harsh world, or
    even a young women violated and trapped.

    It is important to understand that Sophia
    is an emanation of the Christ force, she
    is part of the cosmic drama of his journey
    into creation to fulfill his mission of
    redemption.

sarkic
    Earthly, hidebound, ignorant, uninitiated.
    The lowest level of human thought; the
    fleshly, instinctive level of thinking.

hylic
somatic
    Hylic is the opposite of psychic.

    In the gnostic belief system, hylics, also
    called somatics, were the lowest order of
    the three types of human.

    The other two were the psychics and the
    pneumatics.

    So humanity comprised matter-bound beings,
    matter-dwelling souls and the matter-free
    or immaterial spirits.

    In gnostic theologian Valentinus' triadic
    grouping of man the basest type; a person
    focused on neither intellectual (psychic)
    nor spiritual (pneumatic) reality.

    Lowest order of the three types of human.
    Unable to be saved since their thinking is
    entirely material, incapable of
    understanding the gnosis.

psychic
    "soulful", partially initiated.
    Matter-dwelling spirits.

pneumatic
    "spiritual", fully initiated, immaterial
    souls escaping the doom of the material
    world via gnosis.

kenoma
    The visible or manifest cosmos, "lower"
    than the pleroma.

charisma
    Gift, or energy, bestowed by pneumatics
    through oral teaching and personal
    encounters.

Monad
the One
    In many Gnostic systems, God is known as
    the Monad, the One.

    God is the high source of the pleroma, the
    region of light constituting "the fullness
    of the Godhead."

    The various emanations of God are called
    æons.

    Through a process of emanation, various
    divine entities and realms emerge from the
    One.

    Arranged hierarchically, they become
    progressively degraded due to their
    remoteness from the Father.

    The various emanations of the One,
    totaling thirty in number (or 365,
    according to Basilides), are called Aeons.

    Among them exist Jesus (who resides close
    to the Father) and the lowest emanation,
    Sophia (wisdom), whose fall results in the
    creation of the material world.

    The Monad is a monarchy with nothing above
    it.

    It is he who exists as God and Father of
    everything, the invisible One who is above
    everything, who exists as incorruption,
    which is in the pure light into which no
    eye can look.

    “He is the invisible Spirit, of whom it is
    not right to think of him as a god, or
    something similar.

    For he is more than a god, since there is
    nothing above him, for no one lords it
    over him.

    For he does not exist in something
    inferior to him, since everything exists
    in him.

    For it is he who establishes himself.

    He is eternal, since he does not need
    anything.

    For he is total perfection.

    Absolute is the term used for the ultimate
    or most supreme being, usually conceived
    as either encompassing "the sum of all
    being, actual and potential", or otherwise
    transcending the concept of "being"
    altogether.

    While the general concept of a supreme
    being has been present since ancient
    times, the exact term "Absolute" was first
    introduced by Georg Wilhelm Friedrich
    Hegel, and features prominently in the
    work of many of his followers.

    In Absolute idealism and British idealism,
    it serves as a concept for the
    "unconditioned reality which is either the
    spiritual ground of all being or the whole
    of things considered as a spiritual
    unity".

Pleroma
    [#Gnosticism]

    The spiritual universe as the abode of God
    and of the totality of the divine powers
    and emanations.

    [#Platonism]

    The Hyperuranion would be at the top of
    the Pleroma.

Pistis Sophia
    The expression Pístis Sophía is obscure,
    and its English translations varied:
    - The Wisdom of Faith,
    - Faith Wisdom,
    - Wisdom in Faith, or
    - Faith in Wisdom

Gnosticism
    Gnosticism is the belief that human beings
    contain a piece of God (the highest good
    or a divine spark) within themselves,
    which has fallen from the immaterial world
    into the bodies of humans.

    All physical matter is subject to decay,
    rotting, and death.

    Gnosticism emphasizes individual knowledge
    and wisdom as the path to salvation and
    oneness with God.

    Its followers worship Sophia as both
    divine female creator and counterpart to
    Jesus Christ.

    According to Gnostic beliefs, Christ was
    conceived of as having two aspects: a male
    half, identified as the son of God, and a
    female half, called Sophia, who was
    venerated as the mother of the universe.

    Gnosticism is a collection of religious
    ideas and systems which coalesced in the
    late 1st century AD among Jewish and early
    Christian sects.

    These various groups emphasised personal
    spiritual knowledge above the orthodox
    teachings, traditions, and authority of
    religious institutions.

aeon
æon
    (in Neoplatonism, Platonism, and
    Gnosticism) a power existing from
    eternity; an emanation or phase of the
    supreme deity.

    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aeon_(Gnosticism)

    Various emanations of God are known by
    such names as One, Monad, Aion teleos
    (αἰών τέλεος "The Broadest Aeon"), Bythos
    (βυθός, "depth" or "profundity"), Proarkhe
    ("before the beginning", προαρχή), Arkhe
    ("the beginning", ἀρχή), and Aeons.

    In different systems these emanations are
    differently named, classified, and
    described, but emanation theory is common
    to all forms of Gnosticism.

    In Basilidian Gnosis they are called
    sonships (υἱότητες huiotetes; sing.:
    υἱότης huiotes); according to Marcus, they
    are numbers and sounds; in Valentinianism
    they form male/female pairs called
    syzygies (Greek συζυγίαι, from σύζυγοι
    syzygoi, lit.  "yokings together").

    This source of all being is an Aeon, in
    which an inner being dwells, known as
    Ennoea ("thought, intent", Greek ἔννοια),
    Charis ("grace", Greek χάρις), or Sige
    ("silence", Greek σιγή).

    The split perfect being conceives the
    second Aeon, Nous ("mind", Greek Νους),
    within itself.

    Complex hierarchies of Aeons are thus
    produced, sometimes to the number of
    thirty.

    These Aeons belong to a purely ideal,
    noumenal, intelligible, or supersensible
    world; they are immaterial, they are
    hypostatic ideas.

    Together with the source from which they
    emanate, they form Pleroma ("fullness",
    Greek πλήρωμα).

    The lowest regions of Pleroma are closest
    to darkness—that is, the physical world.

    Prominent early Christian gnostics like
    Valentinus taught that the Monad is the
    high source of the Pleroma, the region of
    light constituting "the fullness of the
    Godhead." Through a process of emanation,
    various divine entities and realms emerge
    from the One.

    Arranged hierarchically, they become
    progressively degraded due to their
    remoteness from the Father.

    The various emanations of the One,
    totaling thirty in number (or 365,
    according to Basilides), are called Aeons.

    Among them exist Jesus (who resides close
    to the Father) and the lowest emanation,
    Sophia (wisdom), whose fall results in the
    creation of the material world.

Marcosians
    The Marcosians were a Gnostic sect founded
    by Marcus, active in Lyon, France and
    southern Europe from the second to the 4th
    century.

    Women held special status in the Marcosian
    communities; they were regarded as
    prophetesses and participated in
    administering the Eucharistic rites.

    Irenaeus accuses Marcus of seducing his
    followers, and scornfully writes (Adversus
    Haereses I.

    13, 4) that the whole sect was an affair
    of "silly women." The Marcosian system was
    a variation of that of Valentinus.

    It retained the 30 Aeons, but called them
    "Greatnesses" and gave them numerical
    values.

    It kept the myth of the fall of Sophia but
    called it a "Divine Deficiency".

    Unique to it was the adaptation of the
    Pythagorean number theory (Isopsephy) to
    Gnosticism.

Tetrad
The Pythagorean Tetrad
    Marcus pushes into further details his
    designation of the Aeons as letters of the
    alphabet.

    There are twenty-four letters in the
    alphabet, and twenty-four is the sum of
    the letters of the names of the first
    tetrad:

    First tetrad:
    - The Unspeakable (ἄῤῥητος)
    - Silence (σειγή)
    - Father (πατήρ)
    - Truth (ἀλήθεια)

    Followed by those of the second tetrad:
    - Word (λόγος)
    - Life (ζωή)
    - Man (ἄνθρωπος)
    - Church (ἐκκλησία)

Sophia
Pistis
    Wanted to create something, alone without
    her consort; and her product was a
    celestial thing.

    Sophia is one of the central figures of
    Gnosticism, a Christian philosophical
    movement with uncertain origins that most
    likely originated in ancient Rome and
    Persia.

chrism
    A ritual anointing with sacred olive oil,
    was what allowed a believer to truly be
    termed a Christian and allowed those
    chosen to move past demons to an eventual
    resurrection.

henosis
    The classical Greek word for mystical
    "oneness", "union" or "unity".

    In Platonism, and especially Neoplatonism,
    the goal of henosis is union with what is
    fundamental in reality: the One, the
    Source, or Monad.

metanoia
    [#Theology]

    In Christian theology, metanoia is
    commonly understood as "a transformative
    change of heart; especially: a spiritual
    conversion." The term suggests
    repudiation, change of mind, repentance,
    and atonement; but "conversion" and
    "reformation" may best approximate its
    connotation.

Simonians
    The Simonians were a Gnostic sect of the
    2nd century which regarded Simon Magus as
    its founder and traced its doctrines,
    known as Simonianism, back to him.

    The sect flourished in Syria, in various
    districts of Asia Minor and at Rome.

precosmic
    Occurring or existing before the existence
    of the universe.

archon
    [#gnosticism]

    The builders of the physical universe.
    A celestial being subordinate to the
    demiurge.

    Among the Archontics, Ophites, Sethians
    and in the writings of Nag Hammadi
    library, the archons are rulers, each
    related to one of seven planets; they
    prevent souls from leaving the material
    realm.

    The political connotation of their name
    reflects rejection of the governmental
    system, as flawed without chance of true
    salvation.

    Archons are tasked with
    deceiving and imprisoning souls in a
    perpetual cycle of reincarnation upon
    Earth which they consider a jailhouse.

    Allegedly, they feed on the negative
    energy released when the emotion of fear
    is invoked within someone, (and they also
    receive energy through the prayers and
    supplications of the ignorant in the name
    of YAHWEH).

secretarian

sectarian
    Of, relating to, or characteristic of a
    sect.

    Adhering or confined to the dogmatic
    limits of a sect or denomination;
    partisan.

Archontic
Archontics
Archontici
    [Gnostic secretarians]

    A Gnostic sect that existed in Palestine
    and Armenia, who arose towards the mid 4th
    century CE.

    They were thus called from the Greek word
    ἄρχοντες, "principalities", or "rulers",
    by reason that they held the world to have
    been created and ruled by malevolent
    Archons.

    Gnostic secretarians whom Epiphanius calls
    Archontics
