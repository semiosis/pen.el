    Compute-to-Data resolves the tradeoff
    between the benefits of using private
    data, and the risks of exposing it.
    
    It does so by providing a means to
    exchange data while preserving privacy by
    allowing the data to stay on-premise with
    data publishers, yet allows data consumers
    to run compute jobs on data â€” all through
    the Ocean Market interface.

    Our response to solving the current
    tradeoff between benefits of using the
    private data and the risks of exposing it.
    
    Compute-to-Data lets data stay on-premise,
    while allowing 3rd parties to run specific
    compute jobs on it, like building AI
    models.

    - Publish data services: downloadable
      files or compute-to-data.

      Ocean creates a new ERC20 datatoken for
      each dataset / data service.

    - Mint datatokens for the service

    - Sell datatokens via an
      OCEAN-datatoken Balancer pool (for auto
      price discovery), or for a fixed price

    - Stake OCEAN on datatoken pools

    - Consume datatokens, to access the service

    - Transfer datatokens to another
      owner, and all other ERC20 actions
      using web3.py etc.
