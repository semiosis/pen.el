ament
    An evolution of catkin.
    
    The word ament is actually a synonym of
    catkin.
    
    For more information about the differences
    please read below.

colcon
    An iteration on the ROS build tools
    catkin_make, catkin_make_isolated,
    catkin_tools and ament_tools.

client libraries

API
    An API, or Application Programming
    Interface, is an interface that is
    provided by an “application”, which in
    this case is usually a shared library or
    other language appropriate shared
    resource.
    
    APIs are made up of files that define a
    contract between the software using the
    interface and the software providing the
    interface.
    
    These files typically manifest as header
    files in C and C++ and as Python files in
    Python.
    
    In either case it is important that APIs
    are grouped and described in documentation
    and that they are declared as either
    public or private.
    
    Public interfaces are subject to change
    rules and changes to the public interfaces
    prompt a new version number of the
    software that provides them.

client_library
    A client library is an API that provides
    access to the ROS graph using primitive
    middleware concepts like Topics, Services,
    and Actions.

package
    A single unit of software, including
    source code, build system files,
    documentation, tests, and other associated
    resources.

REP
    ROS Enhancement Proposal.
    
    A document that describes an enhancement,
    standardization, or convention for the ROS
    community.
    
    The associated REP approval process allows
    the community to iterate on a proposal
    until some consensus has been made, at
    which point it can be ratified and
    implemented, at which point it becomes
    documentation.
    
    All REPs are viewable from the REP index.

VCS
    Version Control System, such as CVS, SVN,
    git, mercurial, etc…

rclcpp
    The C++ specific Client Library for ROS.
    
    This includes any middleware related APIs
    as well as the related message generation
    of C++ data structures based on interface
    definitions like Messages, Services, and
    Actions.

repository
    A collection of packages usually managed
    using a VCS like git or mercurial and
    usually hosted on a site like GitHub or
    BitBucket.
    
    In the context of this document
    repositories usually contain one or more
    packages of one type or another.
