HVM vs PV
    Offers two types of virtualization:
    - Paravirtual (PV), and
    - Hardware Virtual Machine (HVM).

    Each solution offers its own advantages.

    When we’re using AWS, it’s easy for
    someone — almost without thinking — to
    choose which AMI flavor seems best when
    spinning up a new EC2 instance.
    
    Maybe you’re just doing some quick
    testing, or maybe you know all you need
    and your AMI has a relatively recent
    version of Microsoft SQL Server on it.
    
    However, when you dig a little deeper,
    you’ll see that the AMIs offer a choice of
    virtualization type:
    - PV and
    - HVM.

HVM
    HVM guests are fully virtualized.
    
    It means that the VMs running on top of
    their hypervisors are not aware that they
    are sharing processing time with other
    clients on the same hardware.
    
    The host should have the capability to
    emulate underlying hardware for each of
    its guest machines.
    
    This virtualization type provides the
    ability to run an operating system
    directly on top of a VM without any
    modification — as if it were run on the
    bare-metal hardware.
    
    The advantage of this is that HVMs can use
    hardware extensions which provide very
    fast access to underlying hardware on the
    host system.

Paravirtualization
    A lighter form of virtualization than HVM.
    
    This technique is fast and provides near
    native speed in comparison to full
    virtualization.
    
    With Paravirtualization, the guest
    operating system requires some
    modification before everything can work.
    
    These modifications allow the hypervisor
    to export a modified version of the
    underlying hardware to the VMs, allowing
    them near-native performance.
    
    All PV machines running on a hypervisor
    are basically modified operating systems
    like Solaris or various Linux
    distributions.

Amazon Machine Images
AWS AMI
    A supported and maintained image provided
    by AWS that provides the information
    required to launch an instance.
