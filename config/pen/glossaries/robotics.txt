Euler angles
    A set of three rotations about the local
    coordinate system of a moving body.
    
    The current axis of rotation depends on
    the resultant axis position due to
    previous rotations.
    
    Therefore these angles are sequence
    dependent, and the order of rotations must
    be specified, to accurately determine the
    final body orientation.

    An alternative way to express the rotation
    of two adjacent segments is the joint
    coordinate system (JCS) method.
    
    Similar to Euler angles, the relative
    rotation of two body-segment CSs is
    expressed by three rotation angles.

    This is used not just in robotics but in
    anatomy.

trajectories
    - Robots are programmed to follow trajectories
    - Robots may be programmed by providing a
      sequence of points
    - The points may be expressed in:
      - Cartesian coordinates
      - Joint coordinates
    - From points trajectories are generated
    - From trajectories, the controller
      generates commands for actuators
    - Control may be:
      - open loop
      - closed loop
        - low-level
          it uses only information from internal sensors
        - high-level
          it uses information from external sensors

Taxonomy of Trajectories
    The achievable trajectories depend on the
    physical structure of the robot.

    Typical robotic trajectories are:
    - stop-to-stop
    - point-to-point
    - controlled
    - continuous

Stop-to-Stop Trajectories
    Used by joints that can be actuated
    through on/off commands.

    The movement goes between the two ends of
    the joint

    Typical of pneumatic joints

    Open loop control

    Real-time computation is not required

    Programming is achieved by placing the limits

    Re-programming is hard

    This kind of trajectories are used a lot
    in simple industrial applications (like
    pick and place) due to their simplicity.

Continuous Trajectories
    - To program a precise trajectory the
      easiest method consists of manually
      moving the robot while sampling and
      registering the joint variables.
    - Between the samples the controller adopt
      a point-topoint trajectory.
    - Movements are fluent.
    - Memory requirements may be huge.

Real Time Streaming Protocol
RTSP
    A network control protocol designed for
    use in entertainment and communications
    systems to control streaming media
    servers.
    
    The protocol is used for establishing and
    controlling media sessions between end
    points.

QoS in DDS
    A set of configurable parameters that
    control the behavior of a DDS system, such
    as resource consumption, fault tolerance,
    and communication reliability.

GNSS
Global Navigation Satellite System
    The standard generic term for satellite
    navigation systems that provide autonomous
    geo-spatial positioning with global
    coverage.
    
    This term includes e.g. the GPS, GLONASS,
    Galileo, Beidou and other regional
    systems.

    What is GNSS used for?
        GNSS receivers, using the GPS,
        GLONASS, Galileo or BeiDou system, are
        used in many applications.
        
        The first systems were developed in
        the 20th century, mainly to help
        military personnel find their way, but
        location awareness soon found many
        civilian applications.

autoware
autoware.ai
    https://www.autoware.ai/

    The original Autoware project built on
    ROS1.
    
    Launched as a research and development
    platform for autonomous driving
    technology.

    The world's first "All-in-One" open-source
    software for autonomous driving
    technology.
    
    It is based on ROS 1 and available under
    Apache 2.0 license.
    
    It contains the following modules:

    Localization
        Achieved by 3D maps and SLAM
        algorithms in combination with GNSS
        and IMU sensors. 

    Detection
        Uses cameras and LiDARs with sensor
        fusion algorithms and deep neural
        networks.

    Prediction and Planning
        Based on probabilistic robotics and
        rule-based systems, partly using deep
        neural networks as well. 

    output to the vehicle
        The output of Autoware to the vehicle
        is a twist of velocity and angular
        velocity.
        
        This is a part of Control, though the
        major part of Control stack commonly
        reside in the by-wire controller of
        the vehicle.

        Autoware system provides command and
        control over the following functions
        of the vehicle: 
        - Accelerator 
        - Brakes 
        - Steering 
        - Transmission shift 
        - Horn 
        - Turn Signals 
        - Hazard lights 
        - Headlights (on/off and high beam/low beam)

Digital signal processing
DSP
    [#signal processing]

    The use of digital processing, such as by
    computers or more specialized digital
    signal processors, to perform a wide
    variety of signal processing operations.
    
    The digital signals processed in this
    manner are a sequence of numbers that
    represent samples of a continuous variable
    in a domain such as time, space, or
    frequency.
    
    Applications:
    - audio and speech processing,
    - sensor array processing,
        - sonar
        - radar
    - spectral density estimation,
    - statistical signal processing,
    - digital image processing,
    - data compression,
    - video coding,
    - audio coding,
    - image compression,
    - signal processing for telecommunications,
    - control systems,
    - biomedical engineering, and
    - seismology

    The application of digital computation to
    signal processing allows for many
    advantages over analog processing in many
    applications, such as error detection and
    correction in transmission as well as data
    compression.
