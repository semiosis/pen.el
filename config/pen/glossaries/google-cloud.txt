Lighthouse
    An open-source, automated tool for
    improving the quality of web pages. You
    can run it against any web page, public or
    requiring authentication. It has audits
    for performance, accessibility,
    progressive web apps, SEO and more.

    You can run Lighthouse in Chrome DevTools,
    from the command line, or as a Node
    module. You give Lighthouse a URL to
    audit, it runs a series of audits against
    the page, and then it generates a report
    on how well the page did. From there, use
    the failing audits as indicators on how to
    improve the page. Each audit has a
    reference doc explaining why the audit is
    important, as well as how to fix it.

psq
    sudo pip3.5 install psq

    https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/psq
    
    Cloud Pub/Sub Task Queue for Python.

    Pub/sub guarantees your tasks will be
    delivered to the workers, but psq doesn't
    presently guarantee that a task completes
    execution or exactly-once semantics,
    though it does allow you to provide your
    own mechanisms for this.
    
    This is similar to Celery's default
    configuration.
