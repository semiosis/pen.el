Kabbalah
    The ancient Jewish tradition of mystical
    interpretation of the Bible, first
    transmitted orally and using esoteric
    methods (including ciphers).
    
    It reached the height of its influence in
    the later Middle Ages and remains
    significant in Hasidism.

    The most famous form of Jewish mysticism.
    
    It flowered in 13th century Spain with the
    writing of the Zohar, which was originally
    attributed to the 2nd century sage Shimon
    bar Yohai.
    
    The Zohar is a commentary on the Torah,
    concerned primarily with understanding the
    divine world and its relation to our
    world.
    
    According to kabbalah , God as God–also
    known as Ein Sof or “the Infinite”–cannot
    be comprehended by humans.
    
    However, God can be understood and
    described as revealed in ten mystical
    attributes, or sefirot.

Hasidism
    A religious movement that emerged in the
    18th century, spread mystical thinking and
    living to the masses of European Jewry by
    teaching that all people could have an
    experiential connection with God.

Jewish mysticism
    Two fundamental types:
    - moderate, and
    - intensive.

moderate mysticism
    Intellectual in nature.

    It is an attempt to understand God and
    God’s world, and ultimately affect and
    change the divine realm.

    This type of mysticism incorporates many
    aspects of traditional Judaism, including
    Torah study and the performance of the
    commandments, infusing these activities
    with mystical significance.

intensive mysticism
    Experiential in nature.

    Intensive mystics use nontraditional
    religious activities, including chanting
    and meditation, in an attempt to commune
    with God.
