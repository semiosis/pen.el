deplatforming
    “Deplatforming works” has, in recent
    months, become a popular slogan on social
    media.
    
    When a widely reviled public figure is
    booted from a social media platform or a
    television channel, Twitter users repeat
    the phrase as a truism.
    
    And, indeed, there is evidence to support
    the claim that taking away someone’s
    digital megaphone can effectively silence
    them, or significantly reduce their
    influence.

gaslighting
    [colloquialism]

    Making someone question their own reality.
