EP
Extended Playlist
Extended Play
    A project (or body of work) too short to
    be an album but more than one song and
    therefore too long to be a single
    *chuckles*.
    
    It can also be used as a prequel to an
    album (Rick Ross’ The Albert Anastasia
    EP).
    
    These can also be sold — at a lesser price
    than an album — and have proven to be
    successful marketing and sales tools for
    some artists and brands.

Mixtap
    Can be an Album or EP (in terms of
    length), but it is not sold (unless on
    hard copy — to cover the costs of putting
    the music on disc).
    
    It can never be sold.
    
    It is given away to promote the artist(s)
    and generate a fan base.
    
    It is also commonly used by unsigned
    artists looking for their shot at the big
    time.
    
    It is (almost always) a bad idea to
    release and sell the album of an unknown
    artist.
    
    The effort simply doesn’t justify the
    outcome.
    
    Up until recently, mixtapes couldn’t be
    considered for The Grammys.
    
    Chance The Rapper’s Coloring Book is the
    first Grammy-award-winning mixtape.
    
    Much closer to home, Nasty C’s Price City
    mixtape proved to be a huge mainstream
    success.
    
    Leading to the rapper’s “overnight” fame
    and recognition, this body of work served
    as the launching pad for an award winning
    career, a record deal and an endorsement
    deal.

LP
Album
    LP stands for Long Play which is, in
    essence, a full length album.
    
    The Wikipedia definition reads as “[An]
    Album, is a collection of audio recordings
    issued as a single item on CD, record,
    audio tape, or another medium.
    
    Albums of recorded music were developed in
    the early 20th century, first as books of
    individual records, then from 1948 as
    vinyl LP records…”

    Albums are the most important format
    because artists are severely judged on how
    well they put these projects together.

counterpoint
    The relationship between two or more
    musical lines which are harmonically
    interdependent yet independent in rhythm
    and melodic contour.

overture
    Originally, the instrumental introduction
    to a ballet, opera, or oratorio in the
    17th century.
