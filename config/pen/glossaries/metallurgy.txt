refining
    Purifying an impure metal.

    It is to be distinguished from other
    processes such as smelting and calcining
    in that those two involve a chemical
    change to the raw material, whereas in
    refining, the final material is usually
    identical chemically to the original one,
    only it is purer.
    
    The processes used are of many types,
    including pyrometallurgical and
    hydrometallurgical techniques.
