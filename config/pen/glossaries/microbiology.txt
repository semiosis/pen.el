zygote
    (from Ancient Greek ζυγωτός (zygōtós)
    'joined, yoked', from ζυγοῦν (zygoun) 'to
    join, to yoke')

    Eukaryotic cell formed by a fertilization
    event between two gametes.
    
    The zygote's genome is a combination of
    the DNA in each gamete, and contains all
    of the genetic information of a new
    individual organism.

    In multicellular organisms, the zygote is
    the earliest developmental stage.
    
    In humans and most other anisogamous
    organisms, a zygote is formed when an egg
    cell and sperm cell come together to
    create a new unique organism.
    
    In single-celled organisms, the zygote can
    divide asexually by mitosis to produce
    identical offspring.
    
    German zoologists Oscar and Richard
    Hertwig made some of the first discoveries
    on animal zygote formation in the late
    19th century.

action potential
    Defined as a sudden, fast, transitory, and
    propagating change of the resting membrane
    potential.

    Only neurons and muscle cells are capable
    of generating an action potential; that
    property is called the excitability.

    An action potential occurs when the
    membrane potential of a specific cell
    location rapidly rises and falls: this
    depolarization then causes adjacent
    locations to similarly depolarize. 

cytoskeleton
    A microscopic network of protein filaments
    and tubules in the cytoplasm of many
    living cells, giving them shape and
    coherence.
    
microtubules
    Polymers of tubulin that form part of the
    cytoskeleton and provide structure and
    shape to eukaryotic cells.
    
    Microtubules can grow as long as 50
    micrometres and are highly dynamic.
    
    The outer diameter of a microtubule is
    between 23 and 27 nm while the inner
    diameter is between 11 and 15 nm.

eukaryotic cells
    /home/shane/glossaries/microbiology.txt

    Contains membrane-bound organelles such as
    a nucleus, mitochondria, and an
    endoplasmic reticulum.
    
    Organisms based on the eukaryotic cell
    include protozoa, fungi, plants, and
    animals.

fungi
    Fungi are not plants.
    
    Living things are organized for study into
    large, basic groups called kingdoms.
    
    Fungi were listed in the Plant Kingdom for
    many years.
    
    Then scientists learned that fungi show a
    closer relation to animals, but are unique
    and separate life forms.

tubulin
    The protein that polymerizes into long
    chains or filaments that form
    microtubules, hollow fibers which serve as
    a skeletal system for living cells.

mitochondria
    A double-membrane-bound organelle found in
    most eukaryotic organisms.
    
    Some cells in some multicellular organisms
    lack mitochondria.

spindle fibers
    https://biology.stackexchange.com/q/44262

    Spindle fibers form a protein structure
    that divides the genetic material in a
    cell.
    
    [...] At the beginning of nuclear
    division, two wheel-shaped protein
    structures called centrioles position
    themselves at opposite ends of the cell
    forming cell poles.
    
microtubules
    Long protein fibers that extend from the
    centrioles in all possible directions,
    forming what is called a spindle.
