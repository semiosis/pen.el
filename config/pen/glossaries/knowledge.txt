    The accumulated body of data, information,
    and knowledge created in the course of an

codified knowledge
explicit knowledge

tacit knowledge
implicit knowledge
    Knowledge which can not be fully codified.
    
    The key to acquiring tacit knowledge is
    experience.

    Without some form of shared experience, it
    is extremely difficult for people to share
    each other's thinking processes.

    - riding a bike
    - playing the piano
    - driving a car
    - hitting a nail with a hammer

    As opposed to formal, codified or explicit
    knowledge.

    Knowledge that is difficult to express or
    extract, and thus more difficult to
    transfer to others by means of writing it
    down or verbalizing it.
    
    This can include personal wisdom,
    experience, insight, and intuition.
