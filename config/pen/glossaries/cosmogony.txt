emanationism
    An idea in the cosmology or cosmogony of
    certain religious or philosophical
    systems.
    
    Emanation, from the Latin emanare meaning
    "to flow from" or "to pour forth or out
    of", is the mode by which all things are
    derived from the first reality, or
    principle.
    
    All things are derived from the first
    reality or perfect God by steps of
    degradation to lesser degrees of the first
    reality or God, and at every step the
    emanating beings are less pure, less
    perfect, less divine.
    
    Emanationism is a transcendent principle
    from which everything is derived, and is
    opposed to both creationism (wherein the
    universe is created by a sentient God who
    is separate from creation) and materialism
    (which posits no underlying subjective
    and/or ontological nature behind phenomena
    being immanent).
