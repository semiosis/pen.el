auction phase
bidding
    https://youtu.be/hBCRRwuhHRQ?t=119

    The auction concludes when there have been
    3 passes in a row.

    When you make a bid you are always
    suggesting to your partner that you can
    make more than 1 half of the available 13
    tricks (7 tricks at least).

    If you open the bidding 1H you'll be
    saying I can make 6 tricks + 1.

Opening the bidding
    Which hand can open the bidding?
    https://youtu.be/67c2QkVEX3U?t=294

    Not to be confused with "opening lead".

Opening 1-suit
Opening the bidding 1-suit
1-level suit opening
    Opening the bidding with 1 of a suit.

    These are the basic rules.

    Rules:
    - You need at least 12 HCP.
      - That means 12-19 HCP for a suit bid.
      - That means 12-14 HCP for a NT bid.

    Count the high card points.
    If you don't have 12, you can't bid for 1.

    Is this a strict rule or rule of thumb?

    By opening the bidding you are telling
    your partner you have between 12 and 19
    HCP.

    When you bid a suit you are also telling
    your partner you have at least 4 of that
    suit.

    An exception to the above:
    - When you bid 1NT, you are telling your
      partner you have between 12 and (only)
      14 HCP and that your hand is balanced.

    Rules of thumb:
    - Bid your longest suit first
    - bottoms-up
    - tops-down

    See "bottoms-up".
    See "tops-down".

equal lengths rule of thumb
    [#1-level suit opening]

    Sometimes you have 2 suits of equal
    length.

    Examples:
    - bottoms-up
    - tops-down

    These rules of thumb should be
    followed even if the suit you do not pick
    has 'nicer' cards, i.e. AKQJ...

bottoms-up
    [#1-level suit opening]

    [rule of thumb]
    [equal lengths rule of thumb]

    If those suits are 4 cards in length then
    you should bid your lowest ranked suit
    first.

    If you have 4 spades and 4 diamonds, you
    bid 1 diamond.

tops-down
    [#1-level suit opening]

    [rule of thumb]
    [equal lengths rule of thumb]

    If those suits are 5 cards in length then
    you should bid your highest ranked suit
    first.

    If you have 5 spades and 5 diamonds, you
    bid 1 spade.

1-level contract
    Example:
    - 1H
    - 1NT

    There is a presumption you can make 6+1
    tricks.

2-level contract
    Example:
    - 2H
    - 2NT

    There is a presumption you can make 6+2
    tricks.

4-level contract
    Example:
    - 4H
    - 4NT

    There is a presumption you can make 6+4
    tricks.

contract
    The last bid made.

Declarer
    The player who first mentions the suit or
    notrump that becomes the final contract.

Opening Leader
    The player to the left of the declarer who
    starts the play by making the opening
    lead, playing a card face-up on the table.
    The Dummy is declarer's partner.

opening lead
    The first play made by the Opening Leader
    (the person on the declarer's left).

dummy
    May refer to the player holding the dummy,
    or the hand.

    Lays their cards out on the table with the
    trump suit on their right.

    Whether the suit trump is placed on the
    left or right of the dummy appears to be a
    convention.

    - The Partner who is Dummy must:
      - only play as directed.
      - not touch or suggest a card is played.

    Steps:
    1. Find a fit
    2. Decide what level to play your
       contract at.

level
contract level
    From 1 to 7.
    Represents the number of tricks above 6.

    - partscore
    - game
    - slam

contract
    Has levels.

major contract
    Does this include a NT contract or do you
    call that a NoTrumps contract?

minor contract
    Less popular because you need to get more
    tricks to 'make game' (reach game level
    and get the bonus).

partscore
partscore contract
partscore level contract
    [contract]

    When you have less than 25 points between
    you, you are looking for what's called a
    partscore contract.

game level
    This is a significant level of bidding in
    bridge.

    3NT
    4S
    4H
    5D
    5C

    At the game level you get bonus points for
    making your contract.

game
game contract
game level contract
    [contract]

    Once you reach 25 points between you then
    you are looking for a game level contract.

    If you make this contract you get a bonus.

make game
    Successfully completing a game contract.

    The number of trick you need to make game
    depends on the contract you're in.

slam
slam contract
slam level contract
    [contract]

    You need around 33+ points between you and
    your partner to bidding a contract up at
    the slam level.

honor cards
    A, K, Q, J

    They are assigned a point count.

    A = 4 HCP
    K = 3 HCP
    Q = 2 HCP
    J = 1 HCP

    There are 40 total HCP available to all
    players.

fit
    When you and your partner have between you
    8 or more cards in one of the suits.

    If there is a fit then this will be the
    trump suit.

    If there is no fit then you should choose
    NoTrumps.

    If there is a fit in a minor then you can
    choose whether to play in the minor or No
    Trumps.

    It's not the quality of the cards that
    counts but the quantity.

trick
    Each player keeps their own cards in front
    of them.

    If you win the trick you place the cards
    vertically in front of you.

    If you lose the trick you place them
    horizontally.

forcing bid
    Not a limit bid.

    A bid that you make that your partner must
    now repond to.

limit bid
    Not a forcing bid.

    Your partner now has a choice of either
    bidding again or to pass.

responder's limit bid
    How to respond to your partner's opening
    bid.

    These are the basic rules.

    If you have 6 or more HCP then you should
    respond with a bid. Also, consider 6 a
    minimum in order to repond.

    A more accurate rule of thumb is that you
    need 1/2 the amount of points your partner
    suggests they have. If they suggested they
    have 12 HCP, then you need at least 6 and
    if you have at least 6, you should repond.

    You have 3 choices:
    - support your partner's suit
    - bid a new suit
    - bid NoTrumps
      - A last resort

    See "1-level suit opening".

Benjamin Twos
Benji ACOL
Benjamin ACOL
    [Bridge opening convention]

    A system of Two Level Opening Bids
    developed by Albert Benjamin, a Scottish
    bridge teacher.

    Essentially,
    - An Opening bid of 2♣ or 2♢ shows a
      STRONG hand
    - While an Opening bid of 2♡ or 2♠ shows a
      WEAK hand.

Bridge deal
    The specific arrangement of the 52 cards
    into the four hands.

Rubber Bridge
    A form of contract bridge played by two
    competing pairs using a particular method
    of scoring.
    
    A rubber is completed when one pair
    becomes first to win two games, each game
    presenting a score of 100 or more contract
    points; a new game ensues until one pair
    has won two games to conclude the rubber.
    
    Owing to the availability of various
    additional bonus and penalty points in the
    scoring, it is possible, though less
    common, to win the rubber by amassing more
    total points despite losing two games out
    of three.
    
    Rubber bridge involves a high degree of
    skill but there is also a fair amount of
    luck involved in who gets the best cards.

Duplicate Bridge
    The most widely used variation of Contract
    Bridge in club and tournament play.
    
    It is called duplicate because the same
    Bridge deal is played at each table and
    scoring is based on relative performance.
    
    In this way, every hand, whether strong or
    weak, is played in competition with others
    playing identical cards, and the element
    of skill is heightened while that of
    chance is reduced.
    
    Duplicate Bridge stands in contrast to
    Rubber Bridge where each hand is freshly
    dealt and where scores may be more
    affected by chance in the short run.
