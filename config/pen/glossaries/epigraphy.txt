papyrus
    A material similar to thick paper that was
    used in ancient times as a writing
    surface.
    
    It was made from the pith of the papyrus
    plant, Cyperus papyrus, a wetland sedge.
    
    Papyrus (plural: papyri) can also refer to
    a document written on sheets of such
    material, joined side by side and rolled
    up into a scroll, an early form of a book.

epigraphy
    The study and interpretation of ancient
    inscriptions.

    The study of inscriptions, or epigraphs,
    as writing; it is the science of
    identifying graphemes, clarifying their
    meanings, classifying their uses according
    to dates and cultural contexts, and
    drawing conclusions about the writing and
    the writers.
    
    Specifically excluded from epigraphy are
    the historical significance of an epigraph
    as a document and the artistic value of a
    literary composition.
    
    A person using the methods of epigraphy is
    called an epigrapher or epigraphist.

codex
    Essentially, an ancient book, consisting
    of one or more quires of sheets of papyrus
    or parchment folded together to form a
    group of leaves, or pages.

tractate
    A written work dealing formally and
    systematically with a subject; the word
    derives from the Latin tractatus, meaning
    treatise.

The Rosetta Stone
    A stele composed of granodiorite inscribed
    with three versions of a decree issued in
    Memphis, Egypt, in 196 BC during the
    Ptolemaic dynasty on behalf of King
    Ptolemy V Epiphanes.
    
    The top and middle texts are in Ancient
    Egyptian using hieroglyphic and Demotic
    scripts respectively, while the bottom is
    in Ancient Greek.
    
    The decree has only minor differences
    between the three versions, making the
    Rosetta Stone key to deciphering the
    Egyptian scripts.

lacunae
    An unfilled space; a gap.
    "the journal has filled a lacuna in Middle
    Eastern studies"

    A cavity or depression, especially in
    bone.

    formats and domains of the current
