utterance
    [#spoken language analysis]

    The smallest unit of speech.
    
    It is a continuous piece of speech
    beginning and ending with a clear pause.
    
    In the case of oral languages, it is
    generally, but not always, bounded by
    silence.
    
    Utterances do not exist in written
    language, however, only their
    representations do.
    
    They can be represented and delineated in
    written language in many ways.
