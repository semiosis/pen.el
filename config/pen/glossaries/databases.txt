durability
    [ACID property]

    Guarantees that transactions that have
    committed will survive permanently.

    For example, if a flight booking reports
    that a seat has successfully been booked,
    then the seat will remain booked even if
    the system crashes.

Create, read, update and delete
CRUD
    Create, read, update, and delete are the
    four basic functions of persistent
    storage.
    
    Alternate words are sometimes used when
    defining the four basic functions of CRUD,
    such as retrieve instead of read, modify
    instead of update, or destroy instead of
    delete.

federation
    [#databases]

    Several databases hold information, but
    certain instances are completely
    responsible for different portions of the
    data commonly based off characteristics of
    the data itself.

    Federation is typically across machines.
    
    Federating data on a single machine is an
    inappropriate use of the term.
    
    Federation more often applies to schemes
    that divide on logical boundaries, such as
    the geographic definition above.
    
    The Internet is more global, so lets think
    of countries instead.
    
    If we were to take each country and design
    our systems such that all data related to
    each country existed on a different
    server, we have a geographically federated
    systems.
    
    Another common (and practical) example is
    federating based on quality of service
    (paying users vs. free users).
    
    The motivation behind this is clear, it
    makes the task of ensuring service levels
    on the database easier because the data
    set is smaller and it allows one to
    prioritize the investment to improve an
    aspect of the system because of the
    logical separation (e.g. more immediacy
    and money can be applied to ensuring
    availability of the servers that service
    paying users.)

ETL
extract, transform, load
    [process]

    - data Extraction,
    - Transformation, and
    - Loading.

    The process by which data is extracted
    from data sources that are not optimized.

    But also encompasses the details, the
    overlap and the advancements in ETL.
    - The transportation of data.
    - The overlap between each of these
      stages.
    - How new technologies are changing this
      flow.

    Three database functions that are combined
    into one tool to pull data out of one
    database and place it into another
    database.
    
    Extract is the process of reading data
    from a database.
    
    In this stage, the data is collected,
    often from multiple and different types of
    sources.

    OLAP cube usage also meant that data teams
    had to manage complicated pipelines to
    transform data from an SQL database into
    these cubes.
    
    If you were working with a large amount of
    data, such transformation tasks could take
    a long time to complete, so a common
    practice would be to run all ETL pipelines
    before the analysts came in to work.
    
    This way, the analysts wouldn’t need to
    wait for their cubes to be loaded with the
    latest data — they could have the
    computers do the data heavy-lifting at
    night, and start work immediately in the
    mornings.
    
    This approach, of course, became more
    problematic as companies globalized, and
    opened offices in multiple timezones that
    demanded access to the same analytical
    systems.
    
    (How do you run your pipelines at ‘night’
    when your night is another office’s
    morning?)

sharding
    A type of database partitioning that
    separates
    
    very large databases the into smaller,
    faster, more easily managed parts called
    data shards.
    
    The word shard means a small part of a
    whole.

shard
database shard
    A horizontal partition of data in a
    database or search engine.
    
    Each shard is held on a separate database
    server instance, to spread load.
    
    Some data within a database remains
    present in all shards, but some appears
    only in a single shard.
    
    Each shard (or server) acts as the single
    source for this subset of data.

ODBC
Open Database Connector
    It's an API to various databases.
    
    It's quite old (1990s).

    It's not a variant of SQL.
