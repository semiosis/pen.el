    domestic cat.
    
    It is the only member of the genus
    Setonix.
    
    Like other marsupials in the macropod
    family, the quokka is herbivorous and
    mainly nocturnal.

    Puggle-production is not always quite that
    simple, however, as during the breeding
    season females can attract multiple males
    at once, who follow her around single
    file, more or less nose to tail, in what
    are known as 'echidna trains'.

    Many echidnas have a quirky courtship
    ritual known as the echidna love train.
    
    It's where multiple male echidnas follow a
    female around in the hope of becoming her
    mate.
    
    She generally has only one young every
    three years, whereas the males can be
    reproductively active every year.
    
    That means that there's going to be a lot
    more males looking for a reproductively
    active female during the breeding season
    and that's probably what forms the echidna
    trains.
    
    This romantic pursuit takes commitment and
    can last up to four weeks.
    
    For some echidnas during breeding season
    in winter some males travel many
    kilometers outside their home ranges,
    possibly drawn to the chemical odorants
    that female echidnas release.
    
    But until the female is receptive no
    mating happens.
    
    The female has one single mating with one
    single male, and the rest lose out.
    
    These behaviors only occur in some
    subspecies of a echidnas.
    
    Others, like the Tasmanian echidnas aren't
    seen in echidna trains at all, and those
    females mate with many males.
    
    The female echidna lays an egg in her
    pouch which hatches after about 10 days.
    
    Blind and hairless, the young puggle is
    the size of a jelly bean.
    
    Meanwhile, the male echidna returns home
    alone and waits until the next breeding
    season.
