OTA
    Refers to various methods of distributing
    new software, configuration settings, and
    even updating encryption keys to devices
    like mobile phones, set-top boxes or
    secure voice communication equipment
    (encrypted 2-way radios).

codeship
    A fast and secure hosted CI service that
    scales with your needs.
    
    It supports GitHub, Bitbucket, and Gitlab
    projects.

Blue-green deployment
    A technique that reduces downtime and risk
    by running two identical production
    environments called Blue and Green.
    
    At any time, only one of the environments
    is live, with the live environment serving
    all production traffic.
    
    For this example, Blue is currently live
    and Green is idle.

    [#deployment]
    [experimentation-first approach]

    Just like canaries that were once used in
    coal mining to alert miners when toxic
    gases reached dangerous levels, a small
    set of end users selected for testing act
    as the canaries and are used to provide an
    early warning.
