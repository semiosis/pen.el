    notable success in one or more aspects of

    poppy."

anger
    An emotion characterized by antagonism
    toward someone or something you feel has
    deliberately done you wrong.
    
    Anger can be a good thing.
    
    It can give you a way to express negative
    feelings, for example, or motivate you to
    find solutions to problems.
    
    But excessive anger can cause problems.

lust

envy
    A feeling of discontented or resentful
    longing aroused by someone else's
    possessions, qualities, or luck.
    "she felt a twinge of envy for the people
    on board"

    An emotion which occurs when a person
    lacks another's superior quality,
    achievement, or possession and either
    desires it or wishes that the other lacked
    it.
    
    Aristotle defined envy as pain at the
    sight of another's good fortune, stirred
    by "those who have what we ought to have".

gluttony
    Habitual greed or excess in eating.
    "she said plumpness was a sign of gluttony
    in most cases"

    Over-indulgence and over-consumption of
    food, drink, or wealth items, particularly
    as status symbols.
    
    In Christianity, it is considered a sin if
    the excessive desire for food causes it to
    be withheld from the needy.
    
    Some Christian denominations consider
    gluttony one of the seven deadly sins.

sloth
laziness
    The most difficult sin to define and
    credit as sin, since it refers to an
    assortment of ideas, dating from antiquity
    and including mental, spiritual,
    pathological, and physical states.

    Views concerning the virtue of work to
    support society and further God's plan
    suggest that through inactivity, one
    invites sin: "For Satan finds some
    mischief still for idle hands to do."
    ("Against Idleness and Mischief" by Isaac
    Watts).

    Sloth has also been defined as a failure
    to do things that one should do, though
    the understanding of the sin in antiquity
    was that this laziness or lack of work was
    simply a symptom of the vice of apathy or
    indifference, particularly an apathy or
    boredom with God.

self-righteousness
    Recognized as giving final authority for
    one's decisions not to God but to one's
    self.
    
    So self-righteousness becomes,
    paradoxically, a kind of self-trusting
    sacrilege: The person isn't serving God's
    will but profaning God by serving, or
    taking final direction from, themselves.
