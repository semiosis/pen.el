Nearest neighbor search
NNS
    [form of proximity search]
    
    The optimization problem of finding the
    point in a given set that is closest (or
    most similar) to a given point.
    
    Closeness is typically expressed in terms
    of a dissimilarity function: the less
    similar the objects, the larger the
    function values.

convex optimization problem
    A problem where all of the constraints are
    convex functions, and the objective is a
    convex function if minimizing, or a
    concave function if maximizing. Linear
    functions are convex, so linear
    programming problems are convex problems.
