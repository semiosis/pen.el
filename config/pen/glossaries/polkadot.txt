Smart Contract
    Simply some code that exists at an address
    on a chain and is callable by external
    actors.
    
    The key part is that you actually have to
    put the code on chain before anyone can
    start executing it! Deploying your smart
    contract on chain will vary slightly for
    whichever specific parachain you will use,
    but generally you will send a special
    transaction that will create the smart
    contract on the ledger.
    
    You will likely need to pay an associated
    fee for the initialization logic and any
    storage that your contract consumes.

Relay Chain
    The heart of Polkadot, responsible for the
    network’s shared security, consensus and
    cross-chain interoperability.

Parachains
    Sovereign blockchains that can have their
    own tokens and optimize their
    functionality for specific use cases.

    Parachains are "parallel" chains
    containing their own runtime logic and
    benefit from the shared security and the
    cross-chain messaging provided by the
    Polkadot Relay Chain.

    Parachains permit a high degree of
    flexibility and customization but require
    more effort to create and maintain over
    time.

Parathreads
    Similar to parachains but with a pay-as-
    you-go model.
    
    More economical for blockchains that don’t
    need continuous connectivity to the
    network.

    Parathreads are like parachains and enable
    the developer to have lower-level control
    of the logic of their application.
    
    The main difference between the two is
    economic since parathreads will be much
    less expensive to secure than a parachain.
    
    The lower costs of parathreads are due to
    the fact that parathreads will only
    produce a block when they need to, unlike
    parachains, which have secured a slot to
    produce a block at every block of the
    Relay Chain.

Bridges
    Allow parachains and parathreads to
    connect and communicate with external
    networks like Ethereum and Bitcoin.

Nominators
    [Consensus Role]

    Secure the Relay Chain by selecting
    trustworty validators and staking dots.

Validators
    [Consensus Role]

    Secure the relay chain by staking dots,
    validating proofs from collators and
    participating in consensus with other
    validators.

Collators
    [Consensus Role]

    Maintain shards by collecting shard
    transactions from users and producing
    proofs for validator.

Fishermen
    [Consensus Role]

    Monitor the network and report bad
    behavior to validators.

    Collators and any parachain full node can
    perform the fisherman role.

Council Members
    [Governance Role]

    Elected to represent passive stakeholders
    in two primary governance roles: proposing
    referenda and vetoing dangerous or
    malicious referenda.

Technical Committee
    [Governance Role]

    Composed of teams actively building
    Polkadot.
    
    Can propose emergency referenda, together
    with the council, for fast-tracked voting
    and implementation.
