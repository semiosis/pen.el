amniotic
    The amniotic fluid is the protective
    liquid contained by the amniotic sac of a
    gravid amniote.
    
    This fluid serves as a cushion for the
    growing fetus, but also serves to
    facilitate the exchange of nutrients,
    water, and biochemical products between
    mother and fetus.
