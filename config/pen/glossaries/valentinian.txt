logion
    A saying attributed to Christ, especially
    one not recorded in the canonical Gospels.

modelling
    However much a portrait is inferior to an
    actual face, just so is the world inferior
    to the living realm (i.e. the Fullness).

    Now what is the cause of the effectiveness
    of the portrait?

    It is the majesty of the face that has
    furnished to the painter a prototype so
    that the portrait might be honored by his
    name.

    For the form was not reproduced with
    perfect fidelity, yet the name completed
    the deficiency in the act of modeling.

    And so also God invisibly cooperates with
    what has been modeled (i.e. the material
    world) to lend it credence.

Charis
    In the system of Valentinus, was an
    alternative name, with Ennoea and Sige,
    for the consort of the primary Aeon
    Bythos.

    The name expresses that aspect of the
    absolute Greatness in which it is regarded
    not as a solitary monad, but as imparting
    from its perfection to beings of which it
    is the ultimate source; and this is the
    explanation given in the Valentinian
    fragment preserved by Epiphanius.

    The use of the word Charis enabled
    Ptolemaeus to find in John 1:14 the first
    tetrad of Aeons, viz., Pater, Monogenes,
    Charis, Aletheia.

    The suspicion arises that it was with a
    view to such an identification that names
    to be found in the prologue of St.

    John's Gospel were added as alternative
    appellations to the original names of the
    Aeons.

    But this is a point on which we have no
    data to pronounce.

    Charis has an important place in the
    system of Marcus.

    The name Charis appears also in the system
    of the Barbelitae, but as denoting a later
    emanation than in the Valentinian system.

    The word has possibly also a technical
    meaning in the Ophite prayers preserved by
    Origen, all of which end with the
    invocation he charis synesto moi, nai
    pater, synesto.

Hyperuranion
Platonic realm
    This is place in heaven where all ideas of
    real things are collected together.

Pleroma
    [#Gnosticism]

    The spiritual universe as the abode of God
    and of the totality of the divine powers
    and emanations.

    [#Platonism]

    The Hyperuranion would be at the top of
    the Pleroma.

cosmos
    Between the Pleroma and Kenoma.
    This is where Earth exists.

    Cosmos, what is manifest, Valentinian
    initiates could exegete scripture in light
    of these three aspects of correlated
    existence.

    Cosmos is modelled after the Pleroma but
    has more uncertainty and error.

kenoma
abyss
    Emptiness.

    Valentinius, a mid-2nd century Gnostic
    thinker and preacher, was among the early
    Christians who attempted to align
    Christianity with middle Platonism.

    Valentinius pooled dual concepts from the
    Platonic world of ideal forms, or fullness
    (pleroma), and the lower world of
    phenomena, or emptiness (kenoma, κένωμα).

hyleticism
    [sickness]

    Worship of matter.

    The sickness of materialism.

psychism
    [sickness]

    Wworship of the mind-emotional soulm.

    The sickness of abstract intellectualism
    and moralizing.

prototype

image
    Valentinians believed that when they came
    to earth they were also separated from
    their divine reality and thus became
    images.

    Irenaeus taught that when Valentinians “at
    last achieve perfection, [they] shall be
    given as brides to the angels of the
    Savior” (Against Heresies 1.7.5).

    Rather than being a marriage where a man
    and a woman are united, the Valentinian
    bridal chamber was a place where
    individuals were united with their divine
    self, their angel.

icon
    An icon (from Ancient Greek εἰκών (eikṓn)
    'image, resemblance') is a religious work
    of art, most commonly a painting, in the
    cultures of the Eastern Orthodox, Oriental
    Orthodox, the Roman Catholic, and Eastern
    Catholic churches.

    They are not simply artworks; "an icon is
    a sacred image used in religious
    devotion".

    The most common subjects include Christ,
    Mary, saints and angels.

Left
Right
The Left
The Right
    Material elements = the "left".

    Soul = the "right".

    Unlike the Sethians who taught a dualism
    between matter and spirit, Valentinians
    taught that the structure of the universe
    is tripartite.

    In their view, the cosmos consists of
    three distinct components: spirit
    (pneuma), soul (psyche) and matter (hyle).

    This tripartite division is also applied
    to human beings.

    Every human being is said to consist of
    three components: a material body, an
    animating soul, and a spirit.

visio dei
visio verbi dei
visio beatifica
beatific vision
    According to Matt 5:8, the visio Dei or
    vision of God is a promised good; Paul
    contrasts the eschatological vision “face
    to face” (1 Cor 13:12) to the broken,
    fragmentary perception of faith in the
    present (cf. 2 Cor 5:7).

    Against the background of the Platonic
    notion of participation through knowledge,
    Augustine of Hippo developed a doctrine of
    the visio Dei as the epitome of the
    eternal frui Deo (“enjoyment of God”)
    granted to the redeemed.

Valentinus
    https://blogs.uoregon.edu/rel424s15drreis/valentinus/

patristic
    Relating to the early Christian
    theologians or to patristics.

papyrological
    The study of ancient texts from Egypt
    written on papyrus as well as potsherds,
    wooden tablets, etc.

    The dry sands of Egypt have preserved
    hundreds of thousands of these texts.

    The writing material was made from the
    stem of the Egyptian papyrus plant.

syzygy
    The notion of the pair or "syzygy" is
    central to Valentinian thought.

    The term refers to the linking together of
    complementary qualities ("Aeons") of to
    form a state of wholeness (pleroma).

    This is the highest level of reality.

    The halves of a syzygy are often refered
    to as male and female.

    The male corresponds to form and the
    female corresponds to substance.

    God can be understood to consist of four
    primary pairs or syzygies:

    - Depth and Silence (unknowable God),
    - Mind and Truth (comprehensible God),
    - Word and Life (active God),
    - Humanity and Church (immanent God).

kinds of substance
    The Valentinian theory elaborates that
    from Achamoth (he kátō sophía or lower
    wisdom) three kinds of substance take
    their origin, the spiritual (pneumatikoí),
    the animal (psychikoí) and the material
    (hylikoí).

pneumatikoí
spiritual
    [substance]

psychikoí
