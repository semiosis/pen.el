ontology engineering
ontology building
    A set of tasks related to the development
    of ontologies for a particular domain.
    
    It is a subfield of knowledge engineering
    that studies the ontology development
    process, the ontology life cycle, the
    methods and methodologies for building
    ontologies, and the tools and languages
    that support them.
    
    Ontology engineering aims to make explicit
    the knowledge contained in software
    applications, and organizational
    procedures for a particular domain.
    
    Ontology engineering offers a direction
    for overcoming semantic obstacles, such as
    those related to the definitions of
    business terms and software classes.
    
    Known challenges with ontology engineering
    include:

    - Ensuring the ontology is current with
      domain knowledge and term use
    - Providing sufficient specificity and
      concept coverage for the domain of
      interest, thus minimizing the content
      completeness problem
    - Ensuring the ontology can support its
      use cases
