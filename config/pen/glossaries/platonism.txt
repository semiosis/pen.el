atlantis alegory
    [Platonic allegory]

    Atlantis is a fictional island mentioned
    in an allegory on the hubris of nations in
    Plato's works Timaeus and Critias, wherein
    it represents the antagonist naval power
    that besieges "Ancient Athens", the
    pseudo-historic embodiment of Plato's
    ideal state in The Republic.

    In the story, Athens repels the Atlantean
    attack unlike any other nation of the
    known world, supposedly bearing witness to
    the superiority of Plato's concept of a
    state.

    The story concludes with Atlantis falling
    out of favor with the deities and
    submerging into the Atlantic Ocean.

the cave
    [Platonic allegory]

Ring of Gyges
    A mythical magic ring mentioned by the
    philosopher Plato in Book 2 of his
    Republic (2:359a–2:360d).

    It grants its owner the power to become
    invisible at will.

    Through the story of the ring, Republic
    considers whether an intelligent person
    would be just if one did not have to fear
    any bad reputation for committing
    injustices.

    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ring_of_Gyges

    |   Suppose now that there were two such
    |   magic rings, and the just put on one
    |   of them and the unjust the other; no
    |   man can be imagined to be of such an
    |   iron nature that he would stand fast
    |   in justice.
    |
    |   No man would keep his hands off what
    |   was not his own when he could safely
    |   take what he liked out of the market,
    |   or go into houses and lie with any one
    |   at his pleasure, or kill or release
    |   from prison whom he would, and in all
    |   respects be like a god among men.
    |
    |   Then the actions of the just would be
    |   as the actions of the unjust; they
    |   would both come at last to the same
    |   point.
    |
    |   And this we may truly affirm to be a
    |   great proof that a man is just, not
    |   willingly or because he thinks that
    |   justice is any good to him
    |   individually, but of necessity, for
    |   wherever any one thinks that he can
    |   safely be unjust, there he is unjust.
    |
    |   For all men believe in their hearts
    |   that injustice is far more profitable
    |   to the individual than justice, and he
    |   who argues as I have been supposing,
    |   will say that they are right.
    |
    |   If you could imagine any one obtaining
    |   this power of becoming invisible, and
    |   never doing any wrong or touching what
    |   was another's, he would be thought by
    |   the lookers-on to be a most wretched
    |   idiot, although they would praise him
    |   to one another's faces, and keep up
    |   appearances with one another from a
    |   fear that they too might suffer
    |   injustice.

Timaeus
    One of Plato's dialogues, mostly in the
    form of a long monologue given by the
    title character Timaeus of Locri, written
    c. 360 BC.

    The work puts forward speculation on the
    nature of the physical world and human
    beings and is followed by the dialogue
    Critias.

Platonism
    The philosophy of Plato and philosophical
    systems closely derived from it, though
    contemporary platonists do not necessarily
    accept all of the doctrines of Plato.

    Platonism had a profound effect on Western
    thought.

    Platonism at least affirms the existence
    of abstract objects, which are asserted to
    exist in a third realm distinct from both
    the sensible external world and from the
    internal world of consciousness, and is
    the opposite of nominalism.

    This can apply to properties, types,
    propositions, meanings, numbers, sets,
    truth values, and so on (see abstract
    object theory).

    Philosophers who affirm the existence of
    abstract objects are sometimes called
    platonists; those who deny their existence
    are sometimes called nominalists.

    The terms "platonism" and "nominalism"
    also have established senses in the
    history of philosophy.

    They denote positions that have little to
    do with the modern notion of an abstract
    object.

    In a narrower sense, the term might
    indicate the doctrine of Platonic realism,
    a form of mysticism.

    The central concept of Platonism, a
    distinction essential to the Theory of
    Forms, is the distinction between the
    reality which is perceptible but
    unintelligible, associated with the flux
    of Heraclitus and studied by the likes of
    science, and the reality which is
    imperceptible but intelligible, associated
    with the unchanging being of Parmenides
    and studied by the likes of mathematics.

    Geometry was the main motivation of Plato,
    and this also shows the influence of
    Pythagoras.

    The Forms are typically described in
    dialogues such as the Phaedo, Symposium
    and Republic as perfect archetypes of
    which objects in the everyday world are
    imperfect copies.

    Aristotle's Third Man Argument is its most
    famous criticism in antiquity.

    Platonism has had some influence on
    Christianity through Clement of Alexandria
    and Origen, and the Cappadocian Fathers.

    St. Augustine was heavily influenced by
    Platonism as well, which he encountered
    through the Latin translations of Marius
    Victorinus of the works of Porphyry and/or
    Plotinus.

    Platonism was considered authoritative in
    the Middle Ages.

    Platonism also influenced both Eastern and
    Western mysticism.

    Meanwhile, Platonism influenced various
    philosophers.

    While Aristotle became more influential
    than Plato in the 13th century, St.

    Thomas Aquinas's philosophy was still in
    certain respects fundamentally Platonic.

Theory of Forms
Theory of Ideas
    [philosophical theory]
    [concept]
    [world-view]

    Attributed to Plato, that the physical
    world is not as real or true as timeless,
    absolute, unchangeable ideas.

ideal Form
    Abstract, perfect, unchanging concepts or
    ideals that transcend time and space; they
    exist in the Realm of Forms.
    
    Even though the Forms are abstract, that
    doesn't mean they are not real.
    
    In fact, the Forms are more 'real' than
    any individual physical objects.

three reasons for gratitude
    - I was born a human being and not a beast
    - a man and not a woman
    - a Greek and not a barbarian.

    Variously attributed to Thales or Plato.

mathesis
mathēsis
    Let us then attempt to make a few
    suggestions on the subject, not from the
    numbering ascribed to Marcus, but from the
    living side of Pythagorean and Platonic
    mathematics, the “mathēsis” which was the
    same as the “gnōsis,” and which is said to
    have been called even by Pythagoras
    himself, “the gnōsis of things that are.”
