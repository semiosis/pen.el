non-aggression principle
NAP
non-aggression axiom
    A concept in which aggression, defined as
    initiating or threatening any forceful
    interference with either an individual or
    their property, is inherently wrong.
    
    It is considered by some to be a defining
    principle of libertarianism in the United
    States and is also a prominent idea in
    anarcho-capitalism and minarchism.
    
    In contrast to pacifism, the NAP does not
    forbid forceful defense.
    
    There is no single or universal
    interpretation or definition of the NAP as
    it faces several definitional issues,
    including those revolving around
    intellectual property, force, abortion,
    and other topics.

Christian libertarianism
    According to Andrew Sandlin, an American
    theologian and author, Christian
    libertarianism is the view that mature
    individuals are permitted maximum freedom
    under God's law.
