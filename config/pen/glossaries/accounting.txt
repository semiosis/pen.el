Double-entry bookkeeping
    [accounting]

    A system of book keeping where every entry
    to an account requires a corresponding and
    opposite entry to a different account.
    
    The double-entry has two equal and
    corresponding sides known as debit and
    credit.
    
    The left-hand side is debit and right-hand
    side is credit.
