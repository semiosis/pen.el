KProbes
    A debugging mechanism for the Linux kernel
    which can also be used for monitoring
    events inside a production system.
    
    You can use it to weed out performance
    bottlenecks, log specific events, trace
    problems etc.
    
    KProbes was developed by IBM as an
    underlying mechanism for another higher
    level tracing tool called DProbes.
    
    DProbes adds a number of features,
    including its own scripting language for
    the writing of probe handlers.
    
    However, only KProbes has been merged into
    the standard kernel.

BPF
Berkeley Packet Filter
    A technology used in certain computer
    operating systems for programs that need
    to, among other things, analyze network
    traffic.
    
    It provides a raw interface to data link
    layers, permitting raw link-layer packets
    to be sent and received.
    
    It is available on most Unix-like
    operating systems.
    
    In addition, if the driver for the network
    interface supports promiscuous mode, it
    allows the interface to be put into that
    mode so that all packets on the network
    can be received, even those destined to
    other hosts.

        Enables you to use things like KProbes
        without needing to make a kernel
        extension.
        
        BPF is enabling people to do is move
        functionality from the kernel out of
        the kernel so that it can be a service
        can be defined in user space as a BPF
        program and then loaded.

        BPF is a VM in the kernel.
