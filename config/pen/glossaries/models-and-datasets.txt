    The open standard for ML interoperability.
    
    ONNX is an open format built to represent
    ML models. ONNX defines a common set of
    operators - the building blocks of ML and
    DL models - and a common file format to
    enable AI developers to use models with a
    variety of frameworks, tools, runtimes,
    and compilers.
