PB
Personal Best
    This is similar to max, but it also can
    refer to PB repetitions as well.

reps
repititions
    Reps refers to the number of times you
    perform an exercise within a set.

Set
Sets
    A set is a cycle.

    You will perform a number of reps for each
    set, and you will perform a number of sets
    for each exercise.

    For example: You do 3 sets of 10 reps for
    squats.

    3 sets x 10 reps = 30 squats.

rest
    This is less like a nap and more like a
    strategic break.

    In between each set, you rest for a short
    period of time.

    Depending on the intensity of the
    exercise, you might take 1-3 minutes of
    rest between each set.

Warm up
    Warmup is the lighter lifting you do
    before starting an exercise.

    Before lifting heavier weights, you want
    to warm up with lighter weights.

    For example: If you want to bench 200
    lbs., you will want to warm up with 100 –
    150 lbs. first.

Max
    Maybe someone’s unfortunate name in the
    gym, but usually the maximum amount of
    weight one is able to lift for at least 1
    repetition of a specific exercise.
    Sentence: “What’s your deadlift max?”

HIIT
High-Intensity Interval Training
    This refers to exercises which alternate
    between high-intensity periods (everything
    you got) and low-intensity recovery
    periods (slow it down to 50 percent of
    your high-intensity speed or lower).

    For example:
    - 1-minute sprint on the bike followed by
      1-2 minutes at a normal pace—continue
      this cycle for 15 – 30 minutes.

cardio
    Running, biking, swimming, etc.

    In the gym, this refers to use of the
    treadmills, bicycles and ellipticals.

    Pretty much, the machines not involving
    weights.

    You’ll find a lot of weightlifters are
    cardio haters, but don’t take it
    personally.

machines
    Gym equipment designed to work your
    muscles by guiding you through a
    controlled exercise.

    These are the odd-looking contraptions
    that take up the majority of space in most
    gyms.

barbell
    The long steel bars.

    Plates are stacked on both ends.

    Used in a variety of workouts.

dumbbell
    The small, hand-size bar with weight on
    both ends.

    You’ll usually find these stacked on
    shelves in weights ranging from 5 – 100
    lbs. in 5 lbs. increments.

EZ Bar
    The short barbell with the two humps in
    it—for a more comfortable grip.

free weights
    Dumbbells, barbells, plates.

    Used to describe the lifting equipment not
    attached to a machine.

    Hence, the weights are “free.”

bench
bench press
    Bench is frequently used as a verb
    referring to “bench press.” Sentence:
    “It’s Monday, man.

    You know what that means?

    National Chest Day! Let’s go bench our
    faces off.”

plates
    The round weights you place on the end of
    bars.

    Common plates you’ll see are 2.5, 5, 10,
    25, 35 and 45 lbs.

incline
    Any workout you do in which the bench or
    equipment is placed in a manner where your
    upper body is now in an inclined position.

    Sit up, chump!

decline
    Any workout you do in which the bench or
    equipment is placed in a manner where your
    upper body is now in a declined position.

    Lay back, lazy.

plank
    You’re probably thinking of the national
    trend “planking,” where people took
    pictures of themselves lying flat on
    different objects.

    Close.

    Very close.

    Planking is a core strengthening exercise
    (abs exercise).

clamps
    I’ve heard clamps, clips and even grips.

    These are the annoying little circles you
    snap, shove or twist onto the end of
    barbells to prevent plates from sliding
    off.

    Yeah, I hate clamps, even if they have
    saved my life on multiple occasions.

cables
    A pulley system attached to various
    machines and workout systems.

    Essentially, you attach whatever bar,
    rope, handle, etc.

    you want to the cable, set the weight you
    desire and use the resistance for strength
    training.

pump
    The warm, fuzzy feeling you get after
    exerting a lot of strength.

    Increased blood flow in your muscles
    causes them to contract full and tight.

    Sentence: “Broski, quit talking so I can
    finish this last set while I’m pumped!”

super sets
    When you do 2 or more exercises without
    rest periods in between them.

    For example: bench set—no rest—dumbbell
    curl set.

form
    The act of performing an exercise in the
    appropriate way.

    You always want to maintain your form and
    perform exercises correctly.

    Sentence: “Woah, take some weight off.

    You’re killing your form—you look like a
    fish!”

spot
    A spot is when you go and aid someone in
    their workout.

    You usually stand behind them and closely
    watch the lifter to guarantee they
    complete the set.

    People usually request a spot if they are
    lifting heavy weight and aren’t confident
    they’ll be able to finish their set
    without help.

    Those who spot are referred to as
    “spotters.” Proper gym etiquette requires
    you spot those who ask.

    Honestly, it’s not really a question in
    the gym—asking for a spot is more like a
    demand.

    Sentence: “Can you come spot me on my
    squats?

    I’m going for 6 reps, but it’s going to be
    tough.”

gains
    “Gains” can be used in multiple ways: to
    refer to an increase in muscle size or
    just being able to lift more weight
    (though the two usually go together).

    The result of hard work and dedication –
    gains deserve high-fives.

    Sentence: “Derrell, I haven’t seen you in
    forever! Wow, have you been making gains?”

cutting
    For bodybuilders, cutting means reducing
    calories in order to lose body fat.

    Fear not, there’s no real slashing going
    on in the gym.

    Just a bunch of guys and girls trying to
    look good for summer time.

bulking
    The opposite of cutting.

    Bulking is where bodybuilders increase
    their calorie intake to help maximize
    muscle growth.

    A little fat gain is associated with
    bulking, but bodybuilders frequently
    alternate between cutting and bulking to
    balance out.

negatives
    Not pessimistic lifters, silly.

    Negatives are a variation to specific
    exercises.

    Most exercises you use explosive strength
    to lift the weight, then return the weight
    down in a casual, controlled manner.

    For negatives, you lift with the same
    strength, but you very slowly lower the
    weight back to the starting position.

pre-workout
    Pre-workout is a supplement taken before
    workouts to give you fiery strength and
    monstrous energy.

    Drink responsibly, my friends.

Full Range Of Motion (ROM)
    Often, lifters get excited and load up
    heavier weights than they can handle.

    They cheat themselves of contracting the
    entire muscle and only move the weight
    minimal distances.

    Full range of motion is when you extend
    the exercise to the furthest beneficial
    point.

    A classic example of not going the full
    range of motion might be the pushups we
    used to do in elementary school, those
    ones where you pretty much just bent your
    elbows—okay, that might be a little
    extreme, but hopefully you get the point.

chalk
    Maybe some gyms have chalkboards, but
    typically, this chalk is used a little
    different.

    Chalk is the white powder you find left on
    bars which inevitably get all of your
    clothing too.

    Heavy lifters use chalk powder on their
    hands to maintain a better grip on the
    bar, and boy do they slap that stuff
    everywhere.

failure
    Those who go to “failure” are not
    failures.

    It means giving the exercise all that you
    have.

    When you go to failure, you perform the
    exercise until you can no longer go on.

    Failure can be a good thing—only in the
    gym.

    I guess you could say Thomas Edison went
    until failure, and look at the gains he
    made!

Isolation Exercises
    Exercises that engage a single muscle.

    For example:
    - bicep curl, or
    - calf raises.

Compound Exercises
    Exercises that engage multiple muscles.

    For example: bench press, squat or
    deadlift.

plateau
    Plateaus in nature can be pretty, but
    plateaus in the gym are sad.

    Plateaus are extended periods of halted
    progression in the gym.

    If the lifter has been lifting the same
    exact weight for a couple months, he has
    probably plateaued.

Work In
    When someone requests to use the same free
    weights or machine as you.

    During your rest period, the person will
    take his turn lifting, and vice versa.

    Sentence: “Hey, do you mind if I work in?”

ripped
    Ripped, jacked, shredded.

    Pretty intense adjectives, don’t you
    think?

    But these actually carry a positive
    meaning! These descriptions are used to
    describe someone with massive muscles and
    low body fat.

    Sentence: “Dang, that dude is ripped!”

Swole
    Extremely muscular or buff.

    Sentence: “You trying to go get swole
    later today?”

Load/Rack
    Verb meaning to put additional plates on
    the bar.

    Unload or unrack the bar would mean to
    take all the plates off the bar.

Calisthenics
    A form of bodybuilding that does not use
    traditional weights, instead focusing on
    bodyweight.

    Calisthenics involves pull-ups, crunches,
    air squats, pushups, dips, etc.

Macros
    Short for macronutrients: protein,
    carbohydrates and fats.

    Sentence: “Because of that Big Mac, my
    macros are all over the place.”
