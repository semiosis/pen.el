Quantum key distribution
Quantum key exchange
    A cryptographic protocol involving
    components of quantum mechanics. It
    enables two parties to produce a shared
    random secret key known only to them,
    which can then be used to encrypt and
    decrypt messages. It is often incorrectly
    called quantum cryptography, as it is the
    best-known example of a quantum
    cryptographic task.

    An important and unique property of
    quantum key distribution is the ability of
    the two communicating users to detect the
    presence of any third party trying to gain
    knowledge of the key.

Church Turing Thesis

Strong church turing thesis
    Up to polynomial factors in the length of
    the input (for comparable algoriths).

    A less accepted thesis compared to the
    Church Turing Thesis itself.

    P
        Polynomial-time problem

        Efficient short of path algorihtm to get you a yes no answer
        What is the shortest path from b to w in the graph?
        Binary search on the possible pathwars.
        Do Binar search until you narrow down what the actual shortest path is.
        Find the is there a path w of legthe 4
        Find the is there a path w of legthe 3
        Any algorithmic problem that you are trying to solve can be translated into a decision problem.

    NP
        Non-deterministic problem

        This is the class that you could solve
        in polynomial time if only someone
        gave up a big enough hint.

    P and NP and the most common classes. But here are some others.

    P is a subset of all of the other complexity classes.

    P/poly and BPP are the two complexity
    classes we are concerned about in quauntum
    computing.

    P/poly
        L ∈ P/poly
        A language is a member of P/poly
            if there is a sequence of boolean
            circuits Cn of polynomially bounded
            size in n such that |x| = n, Cn(x) = 1
            if and only if x ∈ L.

    BPP
        Fixed size of input n.

A Hamiltonian path
Traceable path
    A path in an undirected or directed graph
    that visits each vertex exactly once.

cryptographic salt
salt
salting
    Cryptographic salt is made up of random
    bits added to each password instance
    before its hashing.
    
    Salts create unique passwords even in the
    instance of two users choosing the same
    passwords.
    
    Salts help us mitigate rainbow table
    attacks by forcing attackers to re-compute
    them using the salts.

elliptic curve
    Defined by:
        y^2=x^3+ax+b

    Example:
        let a=−3 and b=5

zero-knowledge
zero-knowledge proof
zero-knowledge protocol
    [#cryptography]

    A method by which one party can prove to
    another party that they know a value x,
    without conveying any information apart
    from the fact that they know the value x.

Non-interactive zero-knowledge proof
NIZK
zk-SNARK
zk-STARK
    Zero-knowledge proofs that require no
    interaction between the prover and
    verifier.

    Allows you to generate a proof that some
    computation has some particular output, in
    such a way that the proof can be verified
    extremely quickly even if the underlying
    computation takes a very long time to run.
    
    The "ZK" ("zero knowledge") part adds an
    additional feature: the proof can keep
    some of the inputs to the computation
    hidden.

homomorphic encryption
    NLG: Homomorphic encryption is the
    property of some encryption schemes that
    allow the addition and multiplication of
    ciphertexts without decrypting them.
