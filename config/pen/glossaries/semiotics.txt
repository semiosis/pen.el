stipulate
    Demand or specify (a requirement),
    typically as part of an agreement.
    "he stipulated certain conditions before
    their marriage"
    
    To specify or agree to as a condition in
    an agreement: The two firms stipulated a
    payment deadline.

    To agree to (a fact) in order to reduce
    the scope of the dispute to be resolved by
    a court. Used of litigants.

    To concede for the purposes of argument:
    "Even if we stipulate that it's the
    president's duty to bring any American
    soldier home who's been held in captivity,
    it's perfectly reasonable to ask if this
    was a deal he should have made" (Bernard
    Goldberg).

    To state or specify a demand or provision
    in an agreement: The law stipulates for a
    ban on the chemical.

    To form an agreement.

logogram
logograph
lexigraph
    [#Language writing type]

    A written character that represents a word
    or morpheme.
    
    Chinese characters are generally
    logograms, as are many hieroglyphic and
    cuneiform characters.

referent
    A person or thing to which a name - a
    linguistic expression or other symbol -
    refers.

    For example, in the sentence Mary saw me,
    the referent of the word Mary is the
    particular person called Mary who is being
    spoken of, while the referent of the word
    me is the person uttering the sentence.

empty name
    [#metaphysics]
    [#philosophy of language]

    An empty name is a proper name that has no
    referent.

    The problem of empty names is that empty
    names have a meaning that it seems they
    should not have.
    
    The name "Pegasus" is empty; there is
    nothing to which it refers.
    
    Yet, though there is no Pegasus, we know
    what the sentence "Pegasus has two wings"
    means.
    
    We can even understand the sentence "There
    is no such thing as Pegasus." But, what
    can the meaning of a proper name be,
    except the object to which it refers?

    Coined by Quine.

semiosphere
    Falls under biosemiotics and is an
    abstract, epiphenomenal, dialogic membrane
    of semiosis, in which sign processes
    operate under the set of all
    interconnected Umwelt.

code
    A set of cultural conventions,
    contemporary sub-codes, and themes used to
    communicate meaning.
    
    The most common is one's spoken language,
    but the term can also be used to refer to
    any narrative form: consider the color
    scheme of an image (e.g. red for danger),
    or the rules of a board game (e.g. the
    military signifiers in chess).

bricoleur
    The initiator of the bricolage.

    Someone who tinkers, by actually using
    tools not for their designed purpose but
    only as seems fit.
    
    Furthermore, the bricoleur always includes
    parts of his/her self when facing the
    choice of what material to call up for
    modification, reinterpretation and
    adjustment to his/her way of thinking.

bricolage
    Represents the process of creation by
    using materials that are not necessarily
    best-adapted to the task in hand.
    
    Constitutes an eclectic dialogue among
    available materials, thus suggesting
    adaptive courses of action, whereby the
    bricoleur might even modify his/her
    initial aim.
    
    With respect to semiotics, bricolage is
    the process of interpreting symbols and
    signs using available cultural aspects.
    
    If the required aspects are not available,
    people adjust or modify existing ones.
    
    In order to construct new arrangements,
    the bricoleur works with signs, by
    adopting existing signifieds as signifiers
    and by choosing from limited
    possibilities.
    
    In the context of interpretation, semantic
    nihilism cannot exist if the
    bricoleur/interpreter properly adopts and
    accepts the role of creating new,
    individually-understood and individually-
    initiated meanings of one or more signs.

hermeneutics
    The theory and practice of interpretation,
    where interpretation involves an
    understanding that can be justified.
    
    It describes both a body of historically
    divers methodologies for interpreting
    texts, objects, and concepts, and a theory
    of understanding.

langue and parole
    Saussure observes that in speaking a
    language there are two distinct parts that
    are used:
    - the physiological vocal apparatus that
      produces the sound (parole), and
    - the psychological faculties that produce
      the concept (langue).

langue
    The psychological faculties that produce
    the concept.

parole
    The physiological vocal apparatus that
    produces the sound.

binary oppositions
    The syntagmatic is the horizontal axis of
    combination and the paradigmatic is the
    vertical axis of selection.

syntagmatic
syntagmatic axis
syntagmatic axis of language
    The cat plays with a ball comprises words
    that make sense owing to the selective
    combination of signifiers.
    
    The process of arranging the subject (the
    cat) followed by the verb (plays), the
    preposition (with) and finally the
    predicate noun (ball) is what Saussure
    calls the syntagmatic axis of language.

paradigmatic
paradigmatic axis
syntagmatic axis of language
    Works by offering a selection of
    alternatives to the signifiers in a
    sentence.
    
    For instance, in the above example a part
    may be substituted so that the new
    sentence reads: The cat plays with a
    mouse.
    
    Such substitution has the potential to
    completely alter the meaning of a
    sentence.

syntagm
    https://youtu.be/aaRxu1-Z6NY?t=307

    An ordered series of signs that makes
    sense.

    The signs make sense because of their
    relation to other signs.

    e.g.
        "The dog barks at the bird" makes
        sense because of the way the signs are
        ordered

association
    Words related to a word (through meaning,
    letter composition, sound, etc.)

    Unlike in syntagms, order does not matter
    in associations.

    by a circle of his followers at the
    universities of Göttingen and Munich in

sign process
semiosis
semeiosis
    Any form of activity, conduct, or process
    that involves signs, including the
    production of meaning.

    Describes a process that interprets signs
    as referring to their objects, as
    described in Charles Sanders Peirce's
    theory of sign relations, or semiotics.

    A triadic sign relation of:
    - interpretant
    - object
    - representamen

    https://instagib.files.wordpress.com/2011/04/diagram05.jpg

semiosic
    Relating to semiosis.

semeiotic
    One of the terms that Charles Sanders
    Peirce used to describe his theory of
    triadic sign relations, along with
    semiotic and the plural variants of both
    terms.
    
    The form semeiotic is often used to
    distinguish Peirce's theory, since it is
    less often used by other writers to denote
    their particular approaches to the
    subject.

word
linguistic sign
    Unites a concept and sound-image.

representamen
sign
    Something which stands to somebody for
    something in some respect or capacity. 
    
    Types:
    - icon
    - index
    - symbol

    Beginning very roughly, the three main
    ways of being a sign can be described as
    follows:
    
    - An icon is a sign that denotes its
      objects by virtue of a quality that it
      shares with its objects.

    - An index is a sign that denotes its
      objects by virtue of an existential
      connection that it has with its objects.

    - A symbol is a sign that denotes its
      objects solely by virtue of the fact
      that it is interpreted to do so.

    Anything that communicates a meaning, that
    is not the sign itself, to the interpreter
    of the sign.
    
    The meaning can be intentional such as a
    word uttered with a specific meaning, or
    unintentional, such as a symptom being a
    sign of a particular medical condition.
    
    Signs can communicate through any of the
    senses, visual, auditory, tactile,
    olfactory, or taste.

    The outcome/meaning gained.

    e.g. If proposed with a diamond
    (signifier) because of wealth and romance
    (signified).

signifier
    e.g. A word, image or other media such as
    'Diamond'.

signified
    A concept that is associated with the
    signifier.

    e.g. wealth, romance, class.

interpretant
interpretance
    Interpretant is a subject / sign that
    refers to the same object as another sign,
    transitively.

    The effect of a sign on someone who reads
    or comprehends it.
    
    For Peirce, the interpretant is an element
    that allows taking a representamen for the
    sign of an object, and is also the
    "effect" of the process of semeiosis or
    signification.

semiotic function
the semiotic function
    [#psychology]

    The ability to create representations of
    things so that we can communicate with
    each other.
    
    It’s based on the use of signs and symbols
    that have distinct signifieds and
    signifiers.

    https://exploringyourmind.com/semiotic-function-definition-development/

Denotation
    A translation of a sign to its meaning,
    precisely to its literal meaning, more or
    less like dictionaries try to define it.
    
    Denotation is sometimes contrasted to
    connotation, which includes associated
    meanings.

    In logic, linguistics and semiotics, the
    denotation of a word or phrase is a part
    of its meaning; however, the part referred
    to varies by context:

    - In grammar and literary theory, the
      literal meaning or "dictionary
      definition" of a term, devoid of
      emotion, attitude, and color.

    - In semiotics, the surface or literal
      meaning of a signifier.

    - In logic, formal semantics and parts of
      linguistics, the extension of a term.

connotation
    A connotation is a commonly understood
    cultural or emotional association that any
    given word or phrase carries, in addition
    to its explicit or literal meaning, which
    is its denotation.

    Example: ♡
        The denotation is a representation of
        a cartoon heart. The connotation is a
        symbol of love and affection.

renvoi
    The effect distinctive of signs.
    
    For one thing so to stand for another that
    that other is made manifest to or for yet
    another still.

semiosic translation
    https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.1515/sem-2016-0227/html

    The present article explains the tenets of
    an updated version of semiosic
    translation.
    
    Many of the ideas in this paper have been
    brewing forsome time.
    
    For example, the integration of the
    Peircean notions of sign and abduction and
    the Wittgensteinian concepts of
    rule-following, complex-fact,
    and hypothesis.
    
    It turns out that this synthesis leads to
    some new proposals about translation
    semiotics that seek to move the field from
    the reification of objects, concepts and
    practices toward a broader conception of
    translation and translating centered on
    the translator’s agency.
    
    What this means is, among other
    things,that semiosic translation avoids a
    delimitation of signification (things
    and actions conveying meaning) by
    rejecting any conceptual appeals tinged
    with foundationalism.
    
    Rather, my argument will concentrate on
    elucidating the unpredictability of
    semiosis as a determinant of all forms of
    translation across sign systems.

semiotics
    The study of signs and symbols and their
    use or interpretation.

zoosemiotics
    The semiotic study of the use of signs
    among animals, more precisely the study of
    semiosis among animals, i.e. the study of
    how something comes to function as a sign
    to some animal.
    
    It is the study of animal forms of
    knowing.

discourse
    Commonly speaking, the interaction between
    sense and understanding.

discursive
    [#language]
    [#philosophy]

    Digressing from subject to subject.

    "students often write dull, second-hand,
    discursive prose"

    Relating to discourse or modes of
    discourse.

    "the attempt to transform utterances from
    one discursive context to another"

semiosis of angels
    https://muse.jhu.edu/article/636617/pdf

    The question arises, could an intellectual
    semiosis be possible that did not arise
    out of and have constantly at its disposal
    a perceptual base of cognitive materials
    with which to work?
    
    Since discourse, commonly speaking, is
    precisely this interaction between sense
    and understanding, we are asking whether
    there even can be an intellectual semiosis
    which is not discursive.
    
    Or, to put it perhaps more plainly, can
    semiosis extend even beyond the world of
    matter and motion, to achieve its effect
    and proper work also in a realm of pure
    spirits bodiless from the start?

umwelt
    [#semiotics]

    The "biological foundations that lie at
    the very epicenter of the study of both
    communication and signification in the
    human [and non-human] animal".

    The term is usually translated as "self-
    centered world".

Semiotics
semiotic studies
    The study of sign process (semiosis).

    It includes the study of signs and sign
    processes, indication, designation,
    likeness, analogy, allegory, metonymy,
    metaphor, symbolism, signification, and
    communication.

    It is not to be confused with the
    Saussurean tradition called semiology,
    which is a subset of semiotics.

    The semiotic tradition explores the study
    of signs and symbols as a significant part
    of communications.

    Different from linguistics, semiotics also
    studies non-linguistic sign systems.

freeplay
    A reference by Derrida (originally in the
    1960s) to signifiers not being fixed to
    their signifieds but pointing beyond
    themselves to other signifiers in an
    ‘indefinite referral of signifier to
    signified’.
    
    Signs thus always refer to other signs,
    and there is no final sign referring only
    to itself—no transcendent signified.
    
    Meaning is endlessly deferred (see
    difference).
    
    Denying that there were any ultimate
    determinable meanings (see also
    indeterminacy), Derrida championed the
    deconstruction of Western semiotic
    systems.
    
unlimited semiosis
    The term coined by Eco to refer to the way
    in which, for Peirce (via the
    interpretant), for Barthes (via
    connotation), for Derrida (via freeplay),
    and for Lacan (via ‘the sliding
    signified’; see slippage of meaning), the
    signified is endlessly
    commutable—functioning in its turn as a
    signifier for a further signified.
    
    In contrast, while Saussure established
    the general principle that signs always
    relate to other signs (see relational
    model), within his structuralist model the
    relationship between signifier and
    signified is portrayed as stable and
    predictable.
