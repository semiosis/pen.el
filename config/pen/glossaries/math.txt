exponentiation
    Only right-associative.
        In a chain of such operations, they
        group for evaluation purposes from the
        right.

primorial
#
    [#mathematics]
    [#number theory]

    A function from natural numbers to natural
    numbers similar to the factorial function,
    but rather than successively multiplying
    positive integers, the function only
    multiplies prime numbers.

    Factorial:
    4! = 1*2*3*4=24

    Primorial:
    p4# = Π4 = 2*3*5*7=210

    210 is the fourth primorial.

factoring
    Consists of writing a number or another
    mathematical object as a product of
    several factors, usually smaller or
    simpler objects of the same kind.

    a polynomial equation, in contrast to an
    algebraic function.

    [#nomography]
    [mathematical tool]

    A nomogram, also called a nomograph,
    alignment chart, or abaque, is a graphical

    graphical computation of a mathematical
    function

Gödel numbers
Gödel numbering
    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeQX2HjkcNo

    Can be interpreted as an encoding in which
    a number is assigned to each symbol of a
    mathematical notation, after which a
    sequence of natural numbers can then
    represent a sequence of symbols.

    A function that assigns to each symbol and
    well-formed formula of some formal
    language a unique natural number, called
    its Gödel number.
    
    The concept was used by Kurt Gödel for the
    proof of his incompleteness theorems.

    Said "four-ee-ay".

        [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aRUABAUcTiI][0.999... Repeating Is Equal To 1, But Something Like It Is Not {Introduction To The Surreal Numbers} - YouTube]]

    With surreal numbers it makes sense to
    talk about "infinity minus 3","infinity to
    the third power", or "the square root of
    infinity".

    A square matrix used to describe the
    transitions of a Markov chain.

    A matrix whose product with the state
    vector at an initial time gives at a later
    time.

    A differential equation containing one or
    more functions of one independent variable
    and the derivatives of those functions.

    An equation which imposes relations
    between the various partial derivatives of
    a multivariable function.

Lean
    [#Microsoft research]
    [programming language]

    A theorem prover and programming language.
    
    It is based on the Calculus of
    Constructions with inductive types.
    
    Lean has a number of features that
    differentiate it from other interactive
    theorem provers.
    
    Lean can be compiled to JavaScript and
    accessed in a web browser.
    
    It has native support for Unicode symbols.

Logistic function

set comprehension
    S = { 2 · x | x ∈  ℕ , x ≤ 10 }

Logistic map
    Do not confuse with `logistic function`.
    Even though `map` is a posh word for
    function.

    Models population growth.

    Predicts what the next year's population
    is going to be.

    The relative simplicity of the logistic
    map makes it a widely used point of entry
    into a consideration of the concept of
    chaos

Feigenbaum constants
    There are two of them.

    Both constants express ratios in a
    bifurcation diagram for a non-linear map.

    The ratio between the length of each
    period with the last.

    For example, the delta of x for the
    four-cycle divided by the delta of x for
    the two-cycle.

One-cycle
    Because it has a period of 1.

Two-cycle
    Because it has a period of 2.

Four-cycle
    Because it has a period of 4.

Period doubling

coinciding
    Could be:
    - co-occurring
    - matching / fitting

superposable
    [#chemistry]

    A term that describes the ability to
    precisely overlap one object over another.
    Only identical objects are superposable,
    everything else is non-superposable.

congruent
    Harmonious.
    The same.
    Similar.
    Superposable.

inversive geometry
    The study of those properties of figures
    that are preserved by a generalization of
    a type of transformation of the Euclidean
    plane, called inversion.
    
    These transformations preserve angles and
    map generalized circles into generalized
    circles, where a generalized circle means
    either a circle or a line (loosely
    speaking, a circle with infinite radius).
    
    Many difficult problems in geometry become
    much more tractable when an inversion is
    applied.
    
    The concept of inversion can be
    generalized to higher-dimensional spaces.

parametric family
parameterized family
    A family of objects (a set of related
    objects) whose differences depend only on
    the chosen values for a set of parameters.

    Common examples are parametrized (families
    of) functions, probability distributions,
    curves, shapes, etc.

alternating series
    An infinite series.
    
    The signs of the general terms alternate
    between positive and negative.
    
    Like any series, an alternating series
    converges if and only if the associated
    sequence of partial sums converges.

N choose K
{n \choose k}
    Called so because there are (n/k) number
    of ways to choose k elements, irrespective
    of their order from a set of n elements.
    
    To calculate the number of happening of an
    event, N choose K tool is used.
    
    N is the sum of data and K is the number
    that we chose from the sum of data.

    {n \choose k} = _{n}^{k}\textrm{C}= \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}

arity
    'of a function or operation'
    
    The number of arguments or operands the
    function or operation accepts.

apparent distance
apparent separation
    [...between two point objects as viewed
    from a location different from either of
    these objects]
    
    The angle of length between the two
    directions originating from the observer
    and pointing toward these two objects.

vector field
    [vector calculus]

    An assignment of a vector to each point in
    a subset of space.
    
    A vector field in the plane (for
    instance), can be visualised as a
    collection of arrows with a given
    magnitude and direction, each attached to
    a point in the plane.
    
    Vector fields are often used to model, for
    example, the speed and direction of a
    moving fluid throughout space, or the
    strength and direction of some force, such
    as the magnetic or gravitational force, as
    it changes from one point to another
    point.

porism
    A type of mathematical proposition
    considered by Euclid, the meaning of which
    is now obscure.

    [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5bw-Y13pdY][Poncelet's Porism - Numberphile - YouTube]]

    A mathematical proposition or corollary.
    
    In particular, the term porism has been
    used to refer to a direct consequence of a
    proof, analogous to how a corollary refers
    to a direct consequence of a theorem.

corollary
    A proposition that follows from (and is
    often appended to) one already proved.
    
    Forming a proposition that follows from
    one already proved.

laplace transform
    An integral transform that converts a
    function of a real variable t (often time)
    to a function of a complex variable s
    (complex frequency).
    
    The transform has many applications in
    science and engineering because it is a
    tool for solving differential equations.
    
    In particular, it transforms differential
    equations into algebraic equations and
    convolution into multiplication.

inverse laplace transform
    The inverse Laplace transform of a
    function F(s) is the piecewise-continuous
    and exponentially- restricted real
    function f(t) which has the property: L {
    f } ( s ) = L { f ( t ) } ( s ) = F ( s ),
    where L denotes the Laplace transform.
    
    It can be proven that, if a function F(s)
    has the inverse Laplace transform f(t),
    then f(t) is uniquely determined
    (considering functions which differ from
    each other only on a point set having
    Lebesgue measure zero as the same).
        
    The Laplace transform and the inverse
    Laplace transform together have a number
    of properties that make them useful for
    analysing linear dynamical systems.

Amenable group
    [#mathematics]

    A locally compact topological group G
    carrying a kind of averaging operation on
    bounded functions that is invariant under
    translation by group elements.

Topological group
    [#mathematics]

    Logically the combination of groups and
    topological spaces, i.e. they are group
    and topological spaces at the same time,
    s.t. the continuity condition for the
    group operations connect these two
    structures together and consequently they
    are not independent from each other.
