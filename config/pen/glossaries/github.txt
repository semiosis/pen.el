stack graphs
    A new open source framework we've created
    that lets you define the name binding
    rules for a programming language using a
    declarative, domain-specific language
    (DSL).

precise code navigation
    Powered by stack graphs.

    With stack graphs, we can generate code
    navigation data for a repository without
    requiring any configuration from the
    repository owner, and without tapping into
    a build process or other CI job.

    In this post, I'll dig into how stack
    graphs work, and how they achieve these
    results.
