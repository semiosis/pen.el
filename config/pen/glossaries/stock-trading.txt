Short Position
The Short Position
    A technique used when an investor
    anticipates that the value of a stock will
    decrease in the short term, perhaps in the
    next few days or weeks.

    In a short sell transaction the investor
    borrows the shares of stock from the
    investment firm to sell to another
    investor.

    A contract which gives the buyer the
    right, but not the obligation, to buy or
    sell an underlying asset or instrument at
    a specified strike price prior to or on a
    specified date, depending on the form of
    the option.

    To elaborate, when an investor short sells
    a stock, they eventually have to buy it
    back.
    
    For example, if an investor sells a share
    of stock for $300 and the value of that
    stock increases to $400, the investor will
    have to fork over an extra $100 of their
    own money to buy back that share of stock.
    
    By not selling oneâ€™s stock, the demand for
    a particular share of that stock
    increases, ultimately driving up its
    price.
