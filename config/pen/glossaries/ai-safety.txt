instrumental convergence
    The hypothetical tendency for most
    sufficiently intelligent agents to pursue
    potentially unbounded instrumental goals
    provided that their ultimate goals are
    themselves unlimited.

    Posits that an intelligent agent with
    unbounded but apparently harmless goals
    can act in surprisingly harmful ways.
    
    For example, a computer with the sole,
    unconstrained goal of solving an
    incredibly difficult mathematics problem
    like the Riemann hypothesis could attempt
    to turn the entire Earth into one giant
    computer in an effort to increase its
    computational power so that it can succeed
    in its calculations.

explicit bias
    [#ai safety]

    Where output is clearly toxic (cursing,
    slander).

implicit bias
    [#ai safety]

    Where the policy from the output changes
    based on context (e.g. opposition to
    programs that help certain groups,
    probabilities about roles).
