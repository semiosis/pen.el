Irenaeus
    c. 130 â€“ c. 202 AD

    A Greek bishop noted for his role in
    guiding and expanding Christian
    communities in the southern regions of
    present-day France and, more widely, for
    the development of Christian theology by
    combating heresy and defining Catholic
    orthodoxy.
    
    Originating from Smyrna, he had seen and
    heard the preaching of Polycarp, who in
    turn was said to have heard John the
    Evangelist, and thus was the last-known
    living connection with the Apostles.
    
    Chosen as bishop of Lugdunum, now Lyon,
    his best-known work is Against Heresies,
    often cited as Adversus Haereses, a
    refutation of gnosticism, in particular
    that of Valentinus.
    
    To counter the doctrines of the gnostic
    sects claiming secret wisdom, he offered
    three pillars of orthodoxy: the
    scriptures, the tradition handed down from
    the apostles, and the teaching of the
    apostles' successors.
    
    Intrinsic to his writing is that the
    surest source of Christian guidance is the
    Church of Rome, and he is the earliest
    surviving witness to regard all four of
    the now-canonical gospels as essential.
