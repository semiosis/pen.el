golden censer
    Revelation 8:3
        3 Another angel, who had a golden
        censer, came and stood at the altar.
        He was given much incense to offer,
        with the prayers of all God’s people,
        on the golden altar in front of the
        throne.

angelolatry
worship of angels
    Primarily relates to either excessive
    honouring (or possibly invoking the names
    of) angels.

    Colossians 2
    https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Colossians%202&version=KJV

        Let no man beguile you of your reward
        in a voluntary humility and
        worshipping of angels, intruding into
        those things which he hath not seen,
        vainly puffed up by his fleshly mind,

Jophiel
    The angel Jophiel (Heb.  יוֹפִיאֵל‎
    Yōp̄īʾēl, "God is my beauty [alternatively:
    Beauty of God"], "divine beauty"), also
    called Iophiel, Iofiel, Jofiel, Yofiel,
    Youfiel, Zophiel (צֹפִיאֵל‎ Ṣōfīʾēl,
    "spy of God", "watchman of God") and
    Zuriel (צוּרִיאֵל‎ Ṣūrīʾēl, "my rock is
    God"), is a non- canonical archangel of
    wisdom, understanding, and judgment.
    
    She is listed as one of the Seven
    Archangels in Pseudo-Dionysian teachings.
    
    Due to the association with beauty,
    Jophiel is one of very few angels to be
    sometimes portrayed as female.
    
    However, angels have no canonical gender,
    and are most commonly referred to by male
    pronouns.

Eleleth, sagacity
    The great angel who stands in the presence
    of the holy spirit. I have been sent to
    speak with you and save you from the grasp
    of the lawless. And I shall teach you
    about your root.

Cassiel
    An angel appearing in extracanonical
    Jewish, Christian, and Islamic mystical
    and magical works, often as one of the
    Seven Archangels, the angel of Saturn, and
    in other roles.

    Cassiel is sometimes described as the
    angel of tears, the angel of temperance,
    or the angel who presides over the deaths
    of kings.
    
    As Qafsiel, he is sometimes regarded as
    the ruler of the moon instead of Saturn.
