VMware vSphere
    A server virtualization platform from
    VMware.
    
    VMware vSphere debuted in 2009 as the
    successor to the company's flagship VMware
    Infrastructure solution, and it serves as
    a complete platform for implementing and
    managing VM (VM) infrastructure on a large
    scale.

    I think this is like kubetnetes. Instead
    of using vSphere, you can deploy to VMware
    workstation using minikube.
