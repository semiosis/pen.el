T cell exhaustion
    A state of T cell dysfunction that arises
    during many chronic infections and cancer.
    
    It is defined by poor effector function,
    sustained expression of inhibitory
    receptors and a transcriptional state
    distinct from that of functional effector
    or memory T cells.
