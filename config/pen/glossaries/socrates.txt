marriage
    By all means, marry. If you get a good
    wife, you will be happy. If you get a bad
    one, you will be a philosopher.

know thyself
    According to Socrates, true wisdom is
    knowing what you do not know.
    
    So an essential part of knowing yourself
    must be recognizing the limits of your own
    wisdom and understandingâ€”knowing what you
    do genuinely know and knowing what you
    have yet to learn.

to find yourself, think for yourself
    An unexamined life is not worth living.
    
    To find yourself, think for yourself.
    
    The way to gain a good reputation is to
    endeavor to be what you desire to appear.

    To make your own decisions and form your
    own opinions, without depending on other
    people: You can't keep asking me all the
    time, Anna - you're going to have to learn
    to think for yourself.

an unexamined life is not worth living
    According to Socrates, an unexamined life
    is not worth living.
    
    According to Jamison, not only is an
    unexamined life worth living; the rigorous
    examination of life should not be
    encouraged due to its possible negative
    effects on the participants and the entire
    society.

    "The unexamined life is not worth living"
    is a famous dictum apparently uttered by
    Socrates at his trial for impiety and
    corrupting youth, for which he was
    subsequently sentenced to death, as
    described in Plato's Apology.
