atmospherics
    Effects intended to create a particular
    atmosphere or mood, especially in music.
    "a smoky jazz sound with spooky
    atmospherics"

metaphorist
    A creator or user of metaphors.

literalism
    The interpretation of words in their
    literal sense.
    "biblical literalism"

    Literal representation in literature or
    art.

metaphorism
    A neologism from I think, from this book:
    - [[calibredb:327][ 327 - The Language of Surrealism]]

    Many of the examples of surrealist writing
    discussed up to this point can be read in
    ways which render the surreal images as
    metaphors - and these metaphorical
    meanings can be generalised back to the
    everyday world of the reader: surrealism
    is metaphorised.
    
    So, for example, the metamorphosis of
    Narcissus (from Chapter 7) can be read,
    not as a literal transformation as in the
    imaginary poetic world, but as a metaphor
    for trans- formation itself back in the
    prosaic world of the reader.
    
    The apocalyptic images in the chainpoems
    in Chapter 6 can be thematised as
    metaphors for a revolution either in poli-
    tics or personal identity or both.

defamiliarisation
    The representation of objects anew, in a
    way that we do not recognize, or that
    changes our reading of them.

automaticity
    The quality or fact of being performed
    involuntarily or unconsciously, as a
    reflex, innate process, or ingrained
    habit.

    "This online math program helps students
    achieve automaticity in the basic facts of
    addition and subtraction."

dialectics
    Types:
    - creative
    - destructive

chain verse
    Two known forms:
    - one repeats the last work or syllable of
      a line with the first word or syllable
      of the next line, while
    - the other repeats the last line of each
      stanza with the first line of the
      following stanza.

cognitive poetry
    [#cognitive poetics]

    A school of literary criticism that
    applies the principles of cognitive
    science, particularly cognitive
    psychology, to the interpretation of
    literary texts.
    
    It has ties to reader-response criticism,
    and also has a grounding in modern
    principles of cognitive linguistics.
    
    The research and focus on cognitive
    poetics paves way for psychological,
    sociocultural and indeed linguistic
    dimensions to develop in relation to
    stylistics.
    
    Topics addressed by cognitive poetics
    include:
    - deixis; text world theory (the feeling
      of immersion within texts);
    - schema, - script, and their role in
      reading;
    - attention;
    - foregrounding; and
    - genre.
    
    One of the main focal points of cognitive
    literary analysis is conceptual metaphor,
    an idea pioneered and popularized by the
    works of Lakoff, as a tool for examining
    texts.
    
    Rather than regarding metaphors as
    ornamental figures of speech, cognitive
    poetics examines how the conceptual bases
    of such metaphors interact with the text
    as a whole.

    Employs techniques developed in cognitive
    psychology to explicitly address cognitive
    processes underlying the construction of
    multiple conceptual planes.
    
    Techniques:
    - priming,
    - the Stroop effect,
    - multimodal presentation,
    - multilingual presentation.

mind-modelling
mind-reading
    [#surrealism]
    [#cognitive poetics]

    The natural, everyday ability to run a
    'Theory of Mind' assumption about another
    person's status as a person, and then fill
    that mental model out with presumptions
    about:
    - belief,
    - perspective,
    - intended actions,
    - motivations,
    - memories,
    - outlook, and so on.
    
    We engage in exactly the same process with
    fictional characters, and with imagined
    authors, as we deploy in everyday
    experience.
    
    The mechanisms of mind-modelling, then,
    are the basis for how literary
    characterisation works, but they are also
    the same basis for how readers relate to
    authors - and furthermore, how a reader's
    notion of a particular author will
    influence an individual reading of a
    specific text.

René Magritte
René François Ghislain Magritte
    [Belgian artist]

    A Belgian surrealist artist, who became
    well known for creating a number of witty
    and thought-provoking images.
    
    Often depicting ordinary objects in an
    unusual context, his work is known for
    challenging observers' preconditioned
    perceptions of reality.

asemic writing
    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asemic_writing

    A wordless open semantic form of writing.
    
    The word asemic /eɪˈsiːmɪk/ means "having
    no specific semantic content", or "without
    the smallest unit of meaning".
    
    With the non-specificity of asemic writing
    there comes a vacuum of meaning, which is
    left for the reader to fill in and
    interpret.
    
    All of this is similar to the way one
    would deduce meaning from an abstract work
    of art.
    
    Where asemic writing distinguishes itself
    among traditions of abstract art is in the
    asemic author's use of gestural
    constraint, and the retention of physical
    characteristics of writing such as lines
    and symbols.
    
    Asemic writing is a hybrid art form that
    fuses text and image into a unity, and
    then sets it free to arbitrary subjective
    interpretations.
    
    It may be compared to free writing or
    writing for its own sake, instead of
    writing to produce verbal context.

Salvador Dalí
Salvador Domingo Felipe Jacinto Dalí i Domènech
    [Spanish artist]

    A Spanish surrealist artist renowned for
    his technical skill, precise
    draftsmanship, and the striking and
    bizarre images in his work.
    
    Born in Figueres, Catalonia, Spain, Dalí
    received his formal education in fine arts
    in Madrid.

Surrealist Manifesto
    Four Surrealist Manifestos are known to
    exist.
    
    The first two manifestos, published in
    October 1924, were written by Yvan Goll
    and André Breton, the leaders of rivaling
    Surrealist groups.
    
    Breton published his second manifesto for
    the Surrealists in 1929, and wrote his
    third manifesto that was not issued during
    his lifetime.

    inspiration (noun).

naturalism
    Faithful adherence to nature; factual or
    realistic representation.

phantasmagoria
    A sequence of real or imaginary images
    like those seen in a dream.

semiotic art
    Semiotics offers another way of analyzing
    images, be they found in artwork or
    another type of visual culture, like
    advertising.

    Semiotics is the study of signs.

    In semiotics the basic unit is the sign.

    Signs are representations that have
    meanings beyond what they literally
    represent.

automatism
    [art]

    Refers to creating art without conscious
    thought, accessing material from the
    unconscious mind as part of the creative
    process.

    Strategies of writing or creating art that
    aimed to access the unconscious mind.

    The Surrealists, in particular,
    experimented with automatist techniques of
    writing, drawing, and painting.

frottage
    A surrealist and 'automatic' method of
    creative production that involves creating
    a rubbing of a textured surface using a
    pencil or other drawing material

grattage
    [surrealist painting technique]

    Involves laying a canvas prepared with a
    layer of oil paint over a textured object
    and then scraping the paint off to create
    an interesting and unexpected surface

Max Ernst
    (1891-1976)

    A German (naturalised American in 1948 and
    French in 1958) painter, sculptor, graphic
    artist, and poet.

    A prolific artist, Ernst was a primary
    pioneer of the Dada movement and
    surrealism.

    He had no formal artistic training, but
    his experimental attitude toward the
    making of art resulted in his invention of
    frottage-a technique that uses pencil
    rubbings of objects as a source of
    images-and grattage, an analogous
    technique in which paint is scraped across
    canvas to reveal the imprints of the
    objects placed beneath.

    He is also noted for his novels consisting
    of collages.

abstract
abstract art
    Breaking away from the figurative
    representation of objects, abstract art
    reimagines imagery as a study of the
    relationship between shape, form, color,
    and line.

    Abstraction occurs on a continuum,
    including the fractured-yet-recognizable
    forms of Cubism and the totally
    nonpictorial nature of Abstract
    Expressionism.

    A term generally used to describe art that
    is not representational or based on
    external reality or nature.

expressionism
    A modernist movement, initially in poetry
    and painting, originating in Northern
    Europe around the beginning of the 20th
    century.

    Its typical trait is to present the world
    solely from a subjective perspective,
    distorting it radically for emotional
    effect in order to evoke moods or ideas.

abstract expressionism
    The dominant artistic movement in the
    1940s and 1950s, Abstract Expressionism
    was the first to place New York City at
    the forefront of international modern art.

    The associated artists developed greatly
    varying stylistic approaches, but shared a
    commitment to an abstract art that
    powerfully expresses personal convictions
    and profound human values.

    They championed bold, gestural abstraction
    in all mediums, particularly large painted
    canvases.

abstraction
    Non-representational works of art that do
    not depict scenes or objects in the world
    or have discernable subject matter.

appropriation
    As an artistic strategy, the intentional
    borrowing, copying, and alteration of
    preexisting images, objects, and ideas.

avant-garde
    French for “advanced guard,” this term is
    used in English to describe a group that
    is innovative, experimental, and inventive
    in its technique or ideology, particularly
    in the realms of culture, politics, and
    the arts.

baroque
    A term meaning extravagant, complex;
    applied to a style in art and architecture
    developed in Europe from the early
    seventeenth to mid-eighteenth century,
    emphasizing dramatic, often strained
    effect and typified by bold, curving
    forms, elaborate ornamentation, and
    overall balance of disparate parts.

biomorphic
    Derived from the Greek words bios (life)
    and morphe (form), a term referring to
    abstract forms or images that evoke
    associations with living forms such as
    plants and the human body.

    [[gi:biomorphic art]]

brushwork
    Brushwork refers to the way a painter
    applies paint to a surface.

    It is typically characterized by the size,
    texture, and precision of the strokes.

caricature
    A rendering, usually a drawing, of a
    person or thing with exaggerated or
    distorted features, meant to satirize the
    subject.

chiaroscuro
    Italian for “light-dark,” chiaroscuro is
    the use of strong contrasts between
    luminosity and shadow to achieve a sense
    of volume and dimensionality.

    This unique technique was developed during
    the Italian Renaissance by Leonard da
    Vinci, the Baroque period by Caravaggio,
    and the Dutch Golden Age by Rembrandt.

dada
    An artistic and literary movement formed
    in response to the disasters of World War
    I (1914– 18) and to an emerging modern
    media and machine culture.

    Dada artists sought to expose accepted and
    often-repressive conventions of order and
    logic, favoring strategies of chance,
    spontaneity, and irreverence.

    Dada artists experimented with a range of
    mediums, from collage and photomontage to
    everyday objects and performance,
    exploding typical concepts of how art
    should be made and viewed and what
    materials could be used.

    An international movement born in neutral
    Zurich and New York, Dada rapidly spread
    to Berlin, Cologne, Hannover, Paris, and
    beyond.

figurative
    A work of art is considered figurative
    when its subject matter is
    representational.

    Representing a form or figure in art that
    retains clear ties to the real world.

foreground
    The foreground of a work of art is the
    part of the composition that is closest to
    the viewer.

    It is typically discernible from the
    background, which appears to be further
    away.

foreshortening
    A technique in which an artist distorts
    perspective to evoke an illusion of depth.

    Foreshortened subjects often appear to
    recede into the picture plane.

found objects
    An object—often utilitarian, manufactured
    or naturally occurring—that was not
    originally designed for an artistic
    purpose but has been repurposed in an
    artistic context.

    Frottage A technique that involves rubbing
    pencil, graphite, chalk, crayon, or
    another medium onto a

genre
    A category of artistic practice having a
    particular form, content, or technique.
    Examples of genres include:
    - landscape, and
    - still life.

iconography
    Refers to the subject matter, or images,
    used to convey meaning or communicate a
    message in a work of art.

    Subject matter in visual art, often
    adhering to particular conventions of
    artistic representation, and imbued with
    symbolic meanings.

in situ
in-situ
    In its original position or place.

    "I love in-situ in everyday objects.."

juxtaposition
    An act of placing things close together or
    side by side for comparison or contrast.

    Manifesto A public declaration, often
    political in nature, of a group or
    individual’s principles, belie

medium
    A medium is the material used to create
    art.

    Examples of mediums are watercolor paint,
    pastel, clay, and charcoal.

    The materials used to create a work of
    art, and the categorization of art based
    on the materials used (for example,
    painting [or more specifically,
    watercolor], drawing, sculpture).

motif
    In the visual arts, a motif is an element
    of the iconography.

    In paintings, a motif can refer to any
    pictorial feature of the composition.

    In the decorative arts and architecture,
    it often denotes a recognizable symbol
    that repeats.

    A distinctive and often recurring feature
    in a composition.

muse
    The guiding spirit that is thought to
    inspire artists; source of genius or
    inspiration (noun).

naturalism
    Faithful adherence to nature; factual or
    realistic representation.

neo-impressionism
    A term coined by French art critic Fénéon
    in 1886, applied to an avant-garde art
    movement that flourished principally in
    France from 1886 to 1906.

    Led by the example of Georges Seurat, the
    Neo-Impressionists renounced the
    spontaneity of Impressionism in favor of a
    measured painting technique grounded in
    science and the study of optics.

    Neo-Impressionists came to believe that
    separate touches of pigment result in a
    greater vibrancy of color than is achieved
    by the conventional mixing of pigments on
    the palette.

pentimento
    Pentimento (“repentance” in Italian)
    refers to the presence of evidence that an
    artist has painted over a previously
    rendered subject.

    In The Old Guitarist by Pablo Picasso, for
    example, the vague outline of a woman’s
    face is apparent beneath the final
    brushstrokes.

perspective
    The representation of 3-dimensional depth
    and space on a flat surface.

    There are two main types of perspective:
    linear and atmospheric.

    Linear perspective employs intersecting
    lines and vanishing points as a means to
    make objects appear far away.

    According to Leonardo da Vinci in A
    Treatise on Painting, atmospheric
    perspective, on the other hand,
    illustrates the idea that “colors become
    weaker in proportion to their distance
    from the person who is looking at them”
    through tonal changes.

oil paint
    A paint in which pigment is suspended in
    oil, which dries on exposure to air.

old master
    A distinguished European artist of the
    period from about 1500 to the early 1700s,
    especially one of the great painters of
    this period, e.g. Michelangelo.

paranoiac critical method
    Emerging from psychological methods, a
    creative process, developed by Surrealist
    artist Salvador Dalí in the 1930s, for the
    exploration of the creative potential of
    dream imagery and subconscious thoughts.

post-impressionism
    A term coined in 1910 by the English art
    critic and painter Roger Fry and applied
    to the reaction against the naturalistic
    depiction of light and color in
    Impressionism, led by Paul Cézanne, Paul
    Gauguin, Vincent van Gogh, and Georges
    Seurat.

    Though each of these artists developed his
    own, distinctive style, they were unified
    by their interest in expressing their
    emotional and psychological responses to
    the world through bold colors and
    expressive, often symbolic images.

    Post-Impressionism can be roughly dated
    from 1886 to 1905.

subconscious (in technical use, Unconscious)
    In popular writing about psychology, the
    division of the mind containing the sum of
    all thoughts, memories, impulses, desires,
    feelings, etc., that are not subject to a
    person’s perception or control but that
    often affect conscious thoughts and
    behavior (noun).

    The Surrealists derived much inspiration
    from psychoanalyst Sigmund Freud’s
    theories on dreams and the workings of the
    subconscious mind.

surreal
    The definition of surreal is seeming like
    a dream or fantasy.
    
    An example of surreal is the experience of
    seeing a spirit.
    
    Resembling a dream: fantastic and
    incongruous.
    
    Of, related to, or characteristic of
    surrealism.

surreality
absolute reality
super-reality
    The aim of surrealism is to resolve the
    previously contradictory conditions of
    dream and reality into a surreality.

symbol
    A form, sign, or emblem that represents
    something else, often something
    immaterial, such as an idea or emotion.

tone
    Tone refers to the lightness or darkness
    of a particular color.

trompe l’oeil
    In French, trompe l’oeil means “deceive
    the eye.” A technique that creates optical
    illusions of three-dimensionality by
    employing eye-catching lifelike imagery.

venus
    The godess of love and beauty in Roman
    mythology.

liminal space
    The word "liminal" comes from the Latin
    word “limen,” which means threshold.
    
    To be in a liminal space means to be on
    the precipice of something new but not
    quite there yet.
    
    You can be in a liminal space physically,
    emotionally, or metaphorically.
    
    Being in a liminal space can be incredibly
    uncomfortable for most people.

aerography
    [technique]

    A surrealist method in which a stencil
    used in spraypainting is replaced by a
    three-dimensional object, such as a
    person's hand.

    The aerography technique is most
    recognizable as a blended and
    photorealistic style.

    The method has been used to decorate tiles
    from the Victorian era and in the works of
    Man Ray.

automatism
    [technique]

    A term is borrowed from physiology, where
    it describes bodily movements that are not
    consciously controlled like breathing or
    sleepwalking.
    
    Psychoanalyst Sigmund Freud used free
    association and automatic drawing or
    writing to explore the unconscious mind of
    his patients.

bulletism
    [technique]

    An artistic process that involves shooting
    ink at a blank piece of paper. The result
    is a type of ink blot.
    
    The artist can then develop images based
    on what is seen.
    
    Salvador Dalí named this technique.

calligramme
    [technique]

    A calligramme is a text or poem of a type
    developed by Guillaume Apollinaire in
    which the words or letters make up a
    shape, particularly a shape connected to
    the subject of the text or poem.

collage
    [technique]

    The assemblage of different forms creating
    a new whole.
    
    For example, an artistic collage work may
    include newspaper clippings, ribbons, bits
    of colored or hand-made papers,
    photographs, etc., glued to a solid
    support or canvas.

coulage
    [technique]

    A coulage is a kind of automatic or
    involuntary sculpture made by pouring a
    molten material (such as metal, wax,
    chocolate or white chocolate) into cold
    water.
    
    As the material cools it takes on what
    appears to be a random (or aleatoric)
    form, though the physical properties of
    the materials involved may lead to a
    conglomeration of discs or spheres.
    
    The artist may use a variety of techniques
    to affect the outcome.
    
    This technique is also used in the
    divination process known as ceromancy.

cubomania
    [technique]

    A method of making collages in which a
    picture or image is cut into squares and
    the squares are then reassembled without
    regard for the image.
    
    The technique was first used by the
    Romanian surrealist Gherasim Luca.

cut-up technique
    [technique]

    A literary form or method in which a text
    is cut up at random and rearranged to
    create a new text.

decalcomania
    [technique]

    A process of spreading thick paint upon a
    canvas then—while it is still wet—covering
    it with further material such as paper or
    aluminium foil.
    
    This covering is then removed (again
    before the paint dries), and the resultant
    paint pattern becomes the basis of the
    finished painting.
    
    The technique was much employed by artists
    such as Max Ernst.

dream résumé
    [technique]

    Takes the form of an employment résumé but
    chronicles its subject's achievements,
    employment, or the like, in dreams, rather
    than in waking life.
    
    Sometimes dream résumés contain the
    achievements of both, however.

echo poem
    [technique]
    [game]

    An echo poem is a poem written using a
    technique invented by Aurélien Dauguet in
    1972.
    
    The poem is composed by one or more
    persons, working together in a process as
    follows.
    
    The first "stanza" of the poem is written
    on the left-hand column of a piece of
    paper divided into two columns.
    
    Then the "opposite", or 'echo', of the
    first stanza, in whatever sense is
    appropriate to the poem, is composed in
    the right-hand column of the page.
    
    The writing is done automatically and
    often the "opposite" stanza is composed of
    a phonetic correspondence to the first
    stanza.
    
    For a longer work, the third stanza can
    then begin in the left-hand column as an
    "opposite" or a phonetic correspondence to
    what preceded it in the right-hand column.
    
    Then the fourth stanza might be an
    "opposite" or sound correspondence to what
    preceded it in the left-hand column, and
    so forth.
    
    When the poem is completed, the echo of
    the last phrase, line, or sentence,
    generally serves as the title.
    
    This is unrelated to the non-Surrealist
    echo verse form which appears as a
    dialogue between the questions of a
    character and the answers of the nymph
    Echo.

éclaboussure
    [technique]

    A process in Surrealist painting where oil
    paints or watercolours are laid down and
    water or turpentine is splattered, then
    soaked up to reveal random splatters or
    dots where the media was removed.
    
    This technique gives the appearance of
    space and atmosphere.
    
    It was used in paintings by Remedios Varo.

entopic graphomania
    [technique]

    From the book "Vision Dans le Cristal"
    (1945) by Dolfi Trost.
    
    Connecting the dots or scratches is
    drawing technique that aims to stimulate
    creative process and subconscious
    associations.
    
    Trost believed in transformation of human
    consciousness through a dialectical
    process that can lead to a modification of
    human existence at both the personal and
    social level.
    
    Entopic graphomania is a surrealist and
    automatic method of drawing in which dots
    are made at the sites of impurities in a
    blank sheet of paper, and lines are then
    made between the dots; these can be either
    "curved lines... or straight lines.".
    
    Ithell Colquhoun described its results as
    "the most austere kind of geometric
    abstraction." It is to be distinguished
    from "entoptic" methods of drawing or art-
    making, inspired by entoptic phenomena.
    
    The method was invented by Dolfi Trost,
    who as the subtitle of his 1945 book
    ("Vision dans le cristal.  Oniromancie
    obsessionelle.  Et neuf graphomanies
    entopiques") suggests, included nine
    examples therein.
    
    This method of "indecipherable writing"
    (see below) was supposedly an example of
    "surautomatism", the controversial theory
    put forward by Trost and Gherashim Luca in
    which surrealist methods would be
    practiced that "went beyond" automatism.
    
    In Dialectique de Dialectique they had
    proposed the further radicalization of
    surrealist automatism by abandoning images
    produced by artistic techniques in favour
    of those "resulting from rigorously
    applied scientific procedures," allegedly
    cutting the notion of "artist" out of the
    process of creating images and replacing
    it with chance and scientific rigour.
    
    However, the question has arisen whether
    an algorithm should be used to determine
    in what order to connect the dots to
    maintain the "automatic" nature of the
    method.
    
    The method has been compared to the
    "voronoi mathematical progression".

étrécissements
    [technique]

    Collage is perceived as an additive method
    of visual poetry whereas Étrécissements
    are a reductive method.
    
    This was first employed by Marcel Mariën
    in the 1950s.
    
    The results are achieved by the cutting
    away of parts of images to encourage a new
    image, by means of a pair of scissors or
    any other manipulative sharpened
    instrument.

exquisite corpse
cadavre exquis
    [technique]
    [game]
    
    A method by which a collection of words or
    images are collectively assembled, the
    result being known as the exquisite corpse
    or cadavre exquis in French.
    
    Later the game was adapted to drawing and
    collage.

    It is based on an old parlour game known
    by the same name (and also as
    Consequences) in which players wrote in
    turn on a sheet of paper, folded it to
    conceal part of the writing, and then
    passed it to the next player for a further
    contribution.

    A game in which each participant takes
    turns writing or drawing on a sheet of
    paper, folds it to conceal his or her
    contribution, then passes it to the next
    player for a further contribution.

    The game gained popularity in artistic
    circles during the 1920s, when it was
    adopted as a technique by artists of the
    Surrealist movement.

frottage
    [technique]

    A method of creation in which one takes a
    pencil or other drawing tool and makes a
    "rubbing" over a textured surface.
    
    The drawing can either be left as it is or
    used as the basis for further refinement.

fumage
    [technique]

    A technique in which impressions are made
    by the smoke of a candle or kerosene lamp
    on a piece of paper or canvas.
    
    This technique was introduced by Wolfgang
    Paalen.

games
    [technique]

    Games are important not only as a form of
    recreation but as a method of
    investigation.
    
    The intention is to cut away the
    constraints of rationalism and allow
    concepts to develop more freely and in a
    more random manner.
    
    The aim is to break traditional thought
    patterns and create a more original
    outcome.
    
    Old games such as Exquisite corpse, and
    newer ones, notably Time Travelers'
    Potlatch and Parallel Collage, have played
    a critical role.
    
    Examples:
    - Time Travelers' Potlatch
    - Exquisite corpse
    - Parallel Collage

Potlatch
    A gift-giving feast practiced by
    Indigenous peoples of the Pacific
    Northwest Coast of Canada and the United
    States, among whom it is traditionally the
    primary governmental institution,
    legislative body, and economic system. 
    
Time Travelers' Potlatch
    [game]

    A game in which two or more players say
    what gift they would give to another
    person - this is usually an historical
    person who played a role in, or had an
    influence on, the formation of Surrealism.

    Each player indicates the gift that she/he
    would present to various historical,
    mythical, or fictional figures on the
    occasion of their meeting.

    A surrealist game in which two or more
    players say what gift they would give to
    another, usually historical, personage.

Parallel Collage
    [game]
    [surrealist game]

    Requires a minimum of 3 players.

    Each player gives 2 graphic images and 2
    lines of poetic text to the other players.
    
    All players then use the images and lines
    of text (including their own) to construct
    a collage-image and collage-poem.
    
    In the process of construction, a player
    can modify any item, in any way desired.
    
    Until everyone is finished, each person's
    work is kept hidden.
    
    When all images and poems are complete,
    they are shared among the players, with a
    comparison of the results.

grattage
    [technique]

    A surrealist technique in painting in
    which (usually wet) paint is scraped off
    the canvas.
    
    It was employed by Max Ernst and Joan
    Miró.

heatage
    [technique]

    Heatage is an automatic technique
    developed and used by David Hare in which
    an exposed but unfixed photographic
    negative is heated from below, causing the
    emulsion (and the resulting image, when
    developed) to distort in a random fashion.

indecipherable writing
    [technique]

    In addition to its obvious meaning of
    writing that is illegibile or for whatever
    other reason cannot be made out by the
    reader, indecipherable writing refers to a
    set of automatic techniques, most
    developed by Romanian surrealists and
    falling under the heading of
    surautomatism.
    
    Examples include entoptic graphomania,
    fumage and the movement of liquid down a
    vertical surface.

involuntary sculpture
    [technique]

    Surrealism describes as "involuntary
    sculpture" those made by absent-mindedly
    manipulating something, such as rolling
    and unrolling a movie ticket, bending a
    paper clip, and so forth.

latent news
    [technique]

    Latent news is a game in which an article
    from a newspaper is cut into individual
    words (or perhaps phrases) and then
    rapidly reassembled; see also Cut-up
    technique.

movement of liquid down a vertical surface
    [technique]

    The movement of liquid down a vertical
    surface is, as the name suggests, a
    technique, invented by surrealists from
    Romania and said by them to be
    surautomatic and a form of indecipherable
    writing, of making pictures by dripping or
    allowing a flow of some form of liquid
    down a vertical surface.

paranoiac-critical method
    [technique]

    Paranoiac-critical method is a technique
    invented by Salvador Dalí which consists
    of the artist invoking a paranoid state
    (fear that the self is being manipulated,
    targeted or controlled by others).
    
    The result is a deconstruction of the
    psychological concept of identity, such
    that subjectivity becomes the primary
    aspect of the artwork.

parsemage
    [technique]

    A surrealist and automatic method in the
    visual arts invented by Ithell Colquhoun
    in which dust from charcoal or colored
    chalk is scattered on the surface of water
    and then skimmed off by passing a stiff
    paper or cardboard just under the water's
    surface.

photomontage
    [technique]

    Making of composite picture by cutting and
    joining a number of photographs. 

sifflage
    [technique]

    The technique used by Jimmy Ernst in which
    liquid paint is blown to inspire or reveal
    an image.
    
    This is sometimes called "soufflage", but
    Ernst's name was "sifflage".
    
    The result can be seen in his Echo Plasm.

surautomatism
    [technique]

    Any theory or act of taking automatism to
    its most absurd limits. 

triptography
    [technique]

    An automatic photographic technique
    whereby a roll of film is used three times
    (either by the same photographer or, in
    the spirit of Exquisite Corpse, three
    different photographers), causing it to be
    triple-exposed in such a way that the
    chances of any single photograph having a
    clear and definite subject is nearly
    impossible.
    
    Indeed, finding any edges on the negative
    itself during the developing process is a
    nearly impossible task.
    
    Typically the developing of such a roll of
    film is an exercise in automatic technique
    in and of itself, cutting the film by
    counting sprocket holes alone, with no
    regard for the images present on the
    negative.
    
    The results have a quality reminiscent of
    the transitory period in sleep when one
    dream suddenly becomes another.
    
    Creativist Christopher Thurlow claims to
    have discovered this technique when his
    urge to continue taking photographs was
    suddenly challenged by the fact that he
    had run out of un-exposed film.

creativist
    https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=creativist
    https://westernparadigm.wordpress.com/2009/03/27/what-is-a-creativist/

    A human being with a heart-felt need to
    make things.
    
    However this need arises, it drives the
    creativist to write fiction, paint
    landscapes, compose symphonies, design
    computer programs, build sailboats, devise
    political systems … whatever is
    imaginable.
    
    Creativists use creativity to make things
    that are altogether new.
    
    They hope the fruit of their efforts will
    have lasting influence, and that their
    ideas will benefit all people.
    
    Creativists want to live on through their
    work.
    
    They’d also like to reap some reward while
    alive.
    
    Sadly today’s society does not place
    enough emphasis on ingenuity and
    evolutionary thought.
    
    People are afraid of change.
    
    Our social environment rewards what has
    been successful in the past.
    
    Today most creative minds are forced to
    work within the confines of a consumer
    culture geared to get the little guy to
    pay his measly earnings for whatever
    product attracts attention.
    
    The best music, the best writing, the best
    planning, the best filmmaking, the best
    graphic design, goes toward the buy and
    sell of the business world.
    
    Art for art’s sake is left to the wealthy,
    the funded elite, the universities, the
    dedicated poor, and the many part-time
    creativists who must keep “real jobs” in
    order to survive.

uninhibited creative psyche
    The idea of an uninhibited creative psyche
    was conceived as the modus operandi for
    Surrealists.
    
surrealism
    [cultural movement]
    [psychic mechanism]

    The art of self-discovery.

    About finding a bridge between the
    subconscious and reality.

    An artistic mechanism of liberation,
    capable of giving a voice to the silenced
    and of saying everything that is normally
    kept silent.

    A clear objective:
        One of rising above any mere aesthetic
        or moral concern in order to arrive at
        the truth of things.
        
        There is a strong commitment to the
        actual, to the material reality of the
        world, but it is a sense of the real
        that does not set psychic and
        perceptive aspects of life apart from
        the tangible objects of our world.
        
        Instead, pure psychic experience is
        the most real and actual raw truth,
        for the surrealists.
        
        Since culture, capitalism, society,
        and history conspired to distort this
        truth, the task of the surrealists as
        they saw it was to disrupt and
        fracture this illusion back to the raw
        reality of things.

    An artistic and literary movement led by
    French poet André Breton from 1924 through
    World War II.

    Drawing on the psychoanalytic theories of
    Sigmund Freud, the Surrealists sought to
    overthrow what they perceived as the
    oppressive rationalism of modern society
    by accessing the surréalisme (superior
    reality) of the subconscious.

    In his 1924 “Surrealist Manifesto,” Breton
    argued for an uninhibited mode of
    expression derived from the mind’s
    involuntary mechanisms, particularly
    dreams, and called on artists to explore
    the uncharted depths of the imagination
    with radical new methods and visual forms.

    These ranged from abstract “automatic”
    drawings to hyper-realistic painted scenes
    inspired by dreams and nightmares to
    uncanny combinations of materials and
    objects.

    From the outset, a psychic automatism.

    A psychic mechanism or state of mind that
    can stand as a solution for the problems
    of life, like a religious creed.

psychic automatism
pure psychic automatism
    Used in art creation.

    Conceived in relation to a problem of how
    to express a thought unfettered by
    different social concerns.
    
    It was assumed that thoughts run freely in
    the unconscious sphere of the mind, and
    Surrealists aimed at expressing them as
    they are.

    Psychic automatism in its pure state, by
    which one proposes to express—verbally, by
    means of the written word, or in any other
    manner—the actual functioning of thought.
    Dictated by thought, in the absence of any
    control exercised by reason, exempt from
    any aesthetic or moral concern.

latent potentiality
    Wholeness of personality.

active imagination
    [therapeutic method]

    A conscious method of experimentation.

    An ongoing relationship with his lively
    creative spirit through the power of
    imagination and fantasies.
    
    It employs creative imagination as an
    organ for "perceiving outside your mental
    boxes."

    Carl Jung considered this technique to be the
    most powerful tool to access the unconscious
    and for achieving latent potentiality.

    His discovery of active imagination led
    him to associate psychological and
    spiritual transformation with the
    autonomous creation and manipulation of
    images.

    The transcendent function is apparently
    required to 'unlock' this.

double exposure
multiple exposure
    [#surrealist photography]

    The superimposition of two or more
    exposures to create a single image, and
    double exposure has a corresponding
    meaning in respect of two images.
    
    The exposure values may or may not be
    identical to each other.

combination printing
    [#surrealist photography]

    The photographic technique of using the
    negatives of two or more images in
    conjunction with one another to create a
    single image.

montage (photography)
    [#surrealist photography]

    A combination of several photographs
    joined together for artistic effect or to
    show more of the subject than can be shown
    in a single photograph.

solarization (photography)
    [#surrealist photography]

    Eschewed the camera altogether.

    The soundscape of the performance itself
    took priority over any meaningful or

enlightenment rationalism

dilettante

criterion
    "Surrealism brought forth in the beginning
    had nothing to do with any aesthetic
    criterion"

Dada
    Consider "sound poems".

    Such chaotic activities acquired the name
    of 'Dada', a word that cannot be
    definitively sourced.

    It has variously been attributed to the
    ironic reiteration of 'yes' ('da, da') in
    Slavic languages; it is the German for
    both an idiot and the sound a baby makes;
    it is the French for a rocking horse; it
    is the English childish form for 'daddy';
    it is capitalised as 'Dada'; it must
    always appear uncapitalised as 'dada';
    Dadaism should never be suffixed with
    '-ist' or '-ism'.

    All of these contrary etymologies can be
    regarded as equal distractions
    ridiculing the scientist's or historian's
    tendency to categorise and classify.

    Dada resists classification: it is the
    anti-X, where X is whatever you can think
    it is.

    Surrealism is often represented as the
    reaction to Romanticism, but on a longer
    timescale it owes perhaps more to Dada's
    energy as a counter-Enlightenment
    phenomenon.

    Rationalism, logic, and clarity were
    illusive and distorting consequences of
    capitalist industrialisation, the same
    forces which were at that very moment
    responsible for slaughtering millions in
    the trenches a few hundred miles to the
    north.

    Dada was reactive, instinctive, and aimed
    directly at the associations, emotions,
    and visceral senses below the level of
    consciousness.

    As it evolved into surrealism, the work
    became more constructively framed, more
    shaped by principle, and more explic- itly
    aimed at uncovering the unconscious mind
    and speaking to and from it.

presurrealism

alterity
    "hallucinatory alterity"

stream-of-consciousness
    [technique]

    Technique in contemporary modernist
    writers like James Joyce.

    He used a relatively new narrative
    technique known as stream of
    consciousness:
    - going inside the characters' minds to
      reveal innermost thoughts, feelings, and
      sensations.

free association
    Is what distinguishes psychic automatism
    from the 'stream-of-consciousness'
    technique, accord- ing to
    Breton (1969: 298-9).

    The difference lies in the presence of a
    sense of wilful imitation (on the part of
    the artist) as opposed to the absence of
    any wilful intentionality (on the part of
    the surrealist experimental researcher).

    Gascoyne (1935: 94) character- ises these
    early experiments as belonging to the
    'passive or subjective' phase of research,
    in which he includes psychic 'automatism,
    spontaneous and "pure" poetry, and the
    idea of the synonymity of poetry and
    dream'.

    It quickly became obvious, however, that
    such absolutely free association was
    almost impossible to sustain.

self-effacement

anaesthesia

    An ethos of Dada.

ready-made
    Accidentally found objects that were then
    placed into exhibitions and galleries (his
    1917 upturned urinal, entitled Fountain,
    is the most famous of many such
    recontextualisations that persist as
    installations in art to the present day).

objective chance
    Just as Freudian 'slips of the tongue'
    afforded access to unconscious desires, so
    the objective chance of the world of
    experi- ence presented the viewer with
    access to the world's heightened realism.

    The surrealists' commitment to the literal
    in their conception of objective chance
    encompassed both their stylistic
    experiments and their perception of
    reality.

    Automatic writing is no more than the
    re-introduction of objective chance into
    language, whereas objective chance is the
    automatic writing of fate in seemingly raw
    facts.
