Semantic Web stack
    - RDF(S)
    - OWL

    Allow for a fluent representation of
    various types of data and content: data
    schema, taxonomies and vocabularies, all
    sorts of metadata, reference and master
    data.

SPARQL
    [RDF query language]

    A semantic query language for
    databases, able to retrieve and manipulate
    data stored in Resource Description
    Framework format.

Turtle
Terse RDF Triple Language
    [File format]

    A syntax and file format for expressing
    data in the Resource Description Framework
    data model.

    Turtle syntax is similar to that of
    SPARQL, an RDF query language.

    It is a common data format for storing RDF
    data, along with N-Triples, JSON-LD and
    RDF/XML.

OWL
Web Ontology Language
    A family of knowledge representation
    languages for authoring ontologies.

vocabulary
vocabularies
ontology
ontologies
    Define the concepts and relationships
    (also referred to as “terms”) used to
    describe and represent an area of concern.
    
    Used to classify the terms that can be
    used in a particular application,
    characterize possible relationships, and
    define possible constraints on using those
    terms.
    
    The basic building blocks
    for inference techniques on the Semantic
    Web.

    In practice, can be very complex (with
    several thousands of terms) or very simple
    (describing one or two concepts only).
    
    Use "ontology" for more complex, and
    possibly quite formal collection of terms.

    Use "vocabulary" when such strict
    formalism is not necessarily used or only
    in a very loose sense.
