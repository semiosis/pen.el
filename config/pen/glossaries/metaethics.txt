Divine command theory
    The belief that things are right because
    God commands them to be.

    In other words, it means that things which
    are considered wrong or unethical are
    wrong because they are forbidden by God.

    It is an absolutist theory.

    A meta-ethical theory which proposes that
    an action's status as morally good is
    equivalent to whether it is commanded by
    God.

    The theory asserts that what is moral is
    determined by God's commands and that for
    a person to be moral he is to follow God's
    commands.
