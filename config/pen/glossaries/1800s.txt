beshrew
    To beshrew is to invoke a curse on
    someone.
    
    Horrified at discovering an empty baking
    pan, you might yell, "Beshrew all of you
    who ate my brownies!" The verb beshrew is
    so old fashioned that you're most likely
    to discover it in a play or poem by
    Shakespeare, who used it frequently.

    NLG: Curse.

    Remember what Shakespeare said in Hamlet,
    "I could curse the day and night beshrew
    't."
