    [#mathematical logic]

    First-order logic is symbolized reasoning
    in which each sentence, or statement, is
    broken down into a subject and a
    predicate.
    
    The predicate modifies or defines the
    properties of the subject.
    
    In first-order logic, a predicate can only
    refer to a single subject.
    
    First-order logic is also known as first-
    order predicate calculus or first-order
    functional calculus.
    
    A sentence in first-order logic is written
    in the form Px or P(x), where P is the
    predicate and x is the subject,
    represented as a variable.
    
    Complete sentences are logically combined
    and manipulated according to the same
    rules as those used in Boolean algebra.

compactness theorem

    [#model theory]

    A set of first-order sentences has a model
    if and only if every finite subset of it
    has a model.
    
    This theorem is an important tool in model
    theory, as it provides a useful method for
    constructing models of any set of
    sentences that is finitely consistent.
