parser
    [monad]

    Can be expressed in a modular way in terms
    of two simpler monads.

monadic sequencing combinator
    Using this in parsers avoids the messy
    manipulation of nested tuples of results
    present in earlier work.

monad comprehension notation
    Using this makes parsers more compact and
    easier to read.
