    (a portmanteau of "federation" and "universe")

    An ensemble of federated (i.e.
    
    interconnected) servers that are used for
    web publishing (i.e. social networking,
    microblogging, blogging, or websites) and
    file hosting, but which, while
    independently hosted, can communicate with
    each other.
