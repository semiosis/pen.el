RDF/XML
    [Format]

    A syntax, defined by the W3C, to express
    an RDF graph as an XML document.
    
    RDF/XML is sometimes misleadingly called
    simply RDF because it was introduced among
    the other W3C specifications defining RDF
    and it was historically the first W3C
    standard RDF serialization format.

SPARQL
    An RDF query language—that is, a semantic
    query language for databases—able to
    retrieve and manipulate data stored in RDF
    format.

Linked Data
Linked Open Data
LOD
    [#semantic web]

    Structured data which is interlinked with
    other data so it becomes more useful
    through semantic queries.
    
    It builds upon standard Web technologies
    such as HTTP, RDF and URIs, but rather
    than using them to serve web pages only
    for human readers, it extends them to
    share information in a way that can be
    read automatically by computers.
    
    Part of the vision of linked data is for
    the Internet to become a global database.
    
    Tim Berners-Lee, director of the World
    Wide Web Consortium (W3C), coined the term
    in a 2006 design note about the Semantic
    Web project.
    
    Linked data may also be open data, in
    which case it is usually described as
    linked open data (LOD).

Linked Data principles
    [#semantic web]

    - There must be resolvable http:// (or
      https://) URIs.

    - They must resolve, with or without
      content negotiation, to RDF data in one
      of the popular RDF formats (RDFa,
      RDF/XML, Turtle, N-Triples).

    - The dataset must contain at least 1000
      triples. (Hence, your FOAF file most
      likely does not qualify.)

    - The dataset must be connected via RDF
      links to a dataset that is already in
      the diagram. This means, either your
      dataset must use URIs from the other
      dataset, or vice versa. We arbitrarily
      require at least 50 links.

    - Access of the entire dataset must be
      possible via RDF crawling, via an RDF
      dump, or via a SPARQL endpoint.

RDF
Resource Description Framework
    A framework for describing resources on
    the web.
    
    RDF is designed to be read and understood
    by computers.
    
    RDF is not designed for being displayed to
    people.
    
    RDF is written in XML.
