holiness
    The state of being holy.
    "a life of holiness and total devotion to
    God"

    Set-apart from the world, and drawing
    nearer to God.

    A life of discipline, focus, and attention
    to matters of righteous living.
    
    It is, as Paul states in Romans 12:1-2, a
    life fully presented to God in a way that
    transforms our lives to God's glory rather
    than conforming our lives to the ways of
    the world.

    Romans 12:1-2
      Therefore, I urge you, brothers and
      sisters, in view of God’s mercy, to
      offer your bodies as a living sacrifice,
      holy and pleasing to God—this is your
      true and proper worship. 2 Do not
      conform to the pattern of this world,
      but be transformed by the renewing of
      your mind. Then you will be able to test
      and approve what God’s will is—his good,
      pleasing and perfect will.

praxis
    Key in meditation and spirituality, where
    emphasis is placed on gaining first-hand
    experience of concepts and certain areas,
    such as union with the Divine, which can
    only be explored through praxis due to the
    inability of the finite mind (and its
    tool, language) to comprehend or express
    the infinite.

    Wisdom is always taste (in both Latin and
    Hebrew), the word for wisdom comes from
    the word for taste.

    Wisdom is something to taste, not
    something to theorize about.

    "Taste and see that God is good", the
    psalm says; and that's wisdom: tasting
    life.

    No one can do it for us.

    The mystical tradition is very much a
    Sophia tradition.

    It is about tasting and trusting
    experience, before institution or dogma.

    According to Strong's Hebrew dictionary,
    the Hebrew word, ta‛am, is; properly a
    taste, that is, (figuratively) perception;
    by implication intelligence; transitively
    a mandate: advice, behaviour, decree,
    discretion, judgment, reason, taste,
    understanding.

    The action of foretelling or prophesying
    future events.

spirit
    The part of man that connects and
    communicates with God.

    soul can be self-centered.
    
    The joy, comfort and peace of God's
    presence can only be experienced through

non-duality
nondualism
nonduality
interconnectedness
nondual awareness
    A fuzzy concept for which many definitions
    can be found,[note 1] including: a
    rejection of dualistic thinking
    originating in Indian philosophy; the
    nondifference of subject and object; the
    common identity of metaphysical phenomena
    and the Absolute; the "nonduality of
    duality and nonduality"; the unity of God
    and man; or simply monism, the
    nonplurality of the world, or double-
    aspect theory.
    
    The recognition that underlying the
    multiplicity and diversity of experience
    there is a single, infinite and
    indivisible reality, whose nature is pure
    consciousness, from which all objects and
    selves derive their apparently independent
    existence.

    something considered sacred.

    Impiety is often closely associated with
    sacrilege, though it is not necessarily a
    physical action.

    Impiety cannot be associated with a cult,
    as it implies a larger belief system was
    disrespected.

godliness
    The quality or state of being spiritually
    pure or virtuous.

karma
    Action, work, or deed.
    
    For the believers in spirituality the term
    also refers to the spiritual principle of
    cause and effect, often descriptively
    called the principle of karma, wherein
    intent and actions of an individual
    (cause) influence the future of that
    individual (effect): Good intent and good
    deeds contribute to good karma and happier
    rebirths, while bad intent and bad deeds
    contribute to bad karma and bad rebirths.

transmigration
    The movement of a soul into another body
    after death.

    The term is derived from ancient Greek

    the term "transmigration" is more
    appropriate.
