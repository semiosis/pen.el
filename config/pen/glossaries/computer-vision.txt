two view matching
wide baseline stereo
    A basic task needed for 3D reconstruction
    and all things like it.
    
    You get two or more images and you should
    answer if they are depicting the same
    object.
    
    If yes — also output pixel or region
    correspondences between images and
    geometrical relations between them, see an
    example here.

Fréchet Inception Distance
FID
    May be used for filtering images.

    FID is a metric of similarity between
    images.

Object detection
    Bounding boxes.

Semantic Segmentation
    Each pixel is labeled in the image in categories.

    For example, the image is divided into
    human (red), tree (dark green), grass
    (light green), sky (blue) for parts.

Instance Segmentation
    The combination annotation of target
    detection and semantic segmentation. The
    target detection comes first, and then
    each pixel is labeled (semantic
    segmentation). Compared to the image
    above, we take the person as the target
    objection for example:

        Semantic segmentation does not
        distinguish different instances in the
        same category (all people are marked
        red).

        Instance segmentation distinguishes
        different instances of the same
        category (different people are
        distinguished by different colors).

Panoramic segmentation
    Another combination annotation of semantic
    segmentation and instance segmentation,
    more complex.
    
    Panoramic segmentation means that all
    targets should be detected and different
    instances in the same category should be
    distinguished.
    
    Instance segmentation only detects and
    divides the objects in the image (such as
    the people in the above figure) and
    divides them by pixel, and distinguishes
    them using different colors.

    Panoramic segmentation is to detect and
    segment all objects in the picture,
    including the background, and distinguish
    different instances (different colors are
    used)
