unparser
    In computing, an unparser is a system that
    constructs a set of characters or image
    components from a given parse tree.

    An unparser is in effect the reverse of a
    traditional parser that takes a set of
    string of characters and produces a parse
    tree.

    Unparsing generally involves the
    application of a specific set of rules to
    the parse tree as a "tree walk" takes
    place.

    Given that the tree may involve both
    textual and graphic elements, the unparser
    may have two separate modules, each of
    which handles the relevant components.

    In such cases the "master unparser" looks
    up the "master unparse table" to determine
    if a given nested structure should be
    handled by one module, or the other.
