equivalence class
    When the elements of some set S have a
    notion of equivalence defined on them,
    then one may naturally split the set S
    into equivalence classes.
    
    These equivalence classes are constructed
    so that elements a and b belong to the
    same equivalence class if, and only if,
    they are equivalent.

universe

    entities one wishes to consider in a given
