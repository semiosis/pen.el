Sethianism
    The Sethians believed that while the
    material world was created by an ignorant,
    angry and jealous god, Adam himself had a
    spark of divinity that came from the true
    God, the Father who exists in the realm of
    pure spirit.
    
    “Adam is actually smarter and more
    perceptive than the creator being,” Turner
    said.

Autogenes
the Self-Generated One
    [#Sethian Gnosticism]

    Autogenes ("the Self-Generated One") is an
    emanation or son of Barbelo (along with
    Kalyptos and Protophanes according to
    Zostrianos).
    
    Autogenes is mentioned in Nag Hammadi
    texts such as Zostrianos, The Three Steles
    of Seth, Allogenes the Stranger, and
    Marsanes.
    
    Autogenes in Gnosticism is roughly
    parallel to the Platonic soul.
