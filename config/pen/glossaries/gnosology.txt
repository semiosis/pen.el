gnostology
    [#philosophy]

    The study of gnosis, meaning knowledge or
    esoteric knowledge.
    
    The study of gnosis itself covers a number
    of subjects, which include magic, noetics,
    gnostic logic, and logical gnosticism,
    among others.
    
    Gnosology has also been used, particularly
    by James Hutchison Stirling, to render
    Johann Gottlieb Fichte's term for his own
    version of transcendental idealism,
    Wissenschaftslehre, meaning "Doctrine of
    Knowledge".
    
    In Immanuel Kant's gnosology, intuition
    takes a prominent position and was
    introduced as appearing on two levels:
    that of sensation and intellectualization.
    
    Here, the so-called "intellectus ectypus"
    derives its knowledge of objects from
    intuitions of things-in-themselves without
    the forms of intuition while the
    "intellectual archetypus" creates the
    objects of its knowledge through the act
    of thinking them.
    
    Emilii Medtner drew from Kant's gnosology
    along with the Kantian theory of knowledge
    to respond to Carl Jung's Zofingia
    Lectures, particularly to criticize the
    way intuition was conceived as a knowledge
    organ that is capable of functioning with
    validity and independence.

    Let us then attempt to make a few
    suggestions on the subject, not from the
    numbering ascribed to Marcus, but from the
    living side of Pythagorean and Platonic
    mathematics, the “mathēsis” which was the
    same as the “gnōsis,” and which is said to
    have been called even by Pythagoras
    himself, “the gnōsis of things that are.”
