Makemake
    [dwarf planet]

    Resides in the outer solar system.
    
    It was the fourth body identified as a
    dwarf planet, and was one of the bodies
    that caused Pluto to lose its status as a
    planet.
    
    Makemake is large enough and bright enough
    to be studied by a high-end amateur
    telescope.

albedo
    [optics]

    The proportion of the incident light or
    radiation that is reflected by a surface,
    typically that of a planet or moon.

emission nebula
    A nebula formed of ionized gases that emit
    light of various wavelengths.
    
    The most common source of ionization is
    high-energy ultraviolet photons emitted
    from a nearby hot star.

planetary nebula
NN
PNe
    A type of emission nebula consisting of an
    expanding, glowing shell of ionized gas
    ejected from red giant stars late in their
    lives.
    
    The term "planetary nebula" is a misnomer
    because they are unrelated to planets or
    exoplanets.
