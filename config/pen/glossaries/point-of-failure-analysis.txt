Failure Mode and Effects Analysis
FMEA
    A structured approach to discovering
    potential failures that may exist within
    the design of a product or process.
    
    Failure modes are the ways in which a
    process can fail.
    
    Effects are the ways that these failures
    can lead to waste, defects or harmful
    outcomes for the customer.
