Argumentation theory
    A field of study that asks critical
    questions about eristic arguments and the
    other types of dialogue. 

The Sofist
    [Platonic dialogue]

    The main objective of the dialogue is to
    identify what a sophist is and how a
    sophist differs from a philosopher and
    statesman.

    From the philosopher's late period, most
    likely written in 360 BC.
    
    In it the interlocutors, led by Eleatic
    Stranger employ the method of division in
    order to classify and define the sophist
    and describe his essential attributes and
    differentia vis a vis the philosopher and
    statesman.
    
    Like its sequel, the Statesman, the
    dialogue is unusual in that Socrates is
    present but plays only a minor role.
    
    Instead, the Eleatic Stranger takes the
    lead in the discussion.
    
    Because Socrates is silent, it is
    difficult to attribute the views put
    forward by the Eleatic Stranger to Plato,
    beyond the difficulty inherent in taking
    any character to be an author's
    "mouthpiece".

dialectic
dialectics
dialectical method
minor logic
    [#alethiology]

    A discourse between two or more people
    holding different points of view about a
    subject but wishing to establish the truth
    through reasoned argumentation.
    
    Dialectic resembles debate, but the
    concept excludes subjective elements such
    as emotional appeal and the modern
    pejorative sense of rhetoric.
    
    Dialectic may thus be contrasted with both
    the eristic, which refers to argument that
    aims to successfully dispute another's
    argument (rather than searching for
    truth), and the didactic method, wherein
    one side of the conversation teaches the
    other.
    
    Dialectic is alternatively known as minor
    logic, as opposed to major logic or
    critique.

    The art of investigating or discussing the
    truth of opinions.

    Inquiry into metaphysical contradictions
    and their solutions.

    Relating to dialectic or dialectics;
    dialectical.

    The art or practice of arriving at the
    truth by the exchange of logical
    arguments.

    A method of argument or exposition that
    systematically weighs contradictory facts
    or ideas with a view to the resolution of
    their real or apparent contradictions.

    The contradiction between two conflicting
    forces viewed as the determining factor in
    their continuing interaction.

    The method of refutation by examining
    logical consequences.

    Contradiction of ideas that serves as the
    determining factor in their interaction.

eristic
    A type of "question-and-answer" teaching
    method popularized by the Sophists, such
    as Euthydemos and Dionysiodoros.
    
    Students learned eristic arguments to
    "refute their opponent, no matter whether
    he [said] yes or no in answer to their
    initial question".
    
    Plato contrasted this type of argument
    with dialectic and other more reasonable
    and logical methods (e.g., at Republic
    454a).
    
    In the dialogue Euthydemus, Plato
    satirizes eristic.
    
    It is more than persuasion, and it is more
    than discourse.
    
    It is a combination that wins an argument
    without regard to truth.
    
    Plato believed that the eristic style "did
    not constitute a method of argument"
    because to argue eristically is to
    consciously use fallacious arguments,
    which therefore weakens one's position.
