KIF
Knowledge Interchange Format
    http://logic.stanford.edu/kif/dpans.html
    https://web.archive.org/web/20070212094221/http://www.ksl.stanford.edu/knowledge-sharing/kif/#manual

    A programming language created in 1990.
    
    Knowledge Interchange Format (KIF) is a
    computer language designed to enable
    systems to share and re-use information
    from knowledge-based systems.
    
    KIF is similar to frame languages such as
    KL-One and LOOM but unlike such language
    its primary role is not intended as a
    framework for the expression or use of
    knowledge but rather for the interchange
    of knowledge between systems.
    
    The designers of KIF likened it to
    PostScript.

panoptic
    One universe, containing every possible
    'thing': quantifiers work properly.

transparent
    Meanings of expressions do not depend on
    the logical context: equality works
    properly.

unrestricted
    Any name can be used for any logical
    purpose: no type/sort checking, few
    'legality' constraints.

network logic
    Meanings of expressions do not depend on
    their network location: no
    lexical/syntactic negotiation.

    (Horatio principle)

Horatio principle
    http://mark.reid.name/blog/the-horatio-principle.html

    Some events in a large world are
    necessarily nonmeasurable.

semantic web
    A proposed development of the World Wide
    Web in which data in web pages is
    structured and tagged in such a way that
    it can be read directly by computers.

    "the Semantic Web could usher in a golden age of information access"

ontology
    [#metaphysics]
    [noun]

    A set of concepts and categories in a
    subject area or domain that shows their
    properties and the relations between them.

    "what's new about our ontology is that it
    is created automatically from large
    datasets"


    [#metaphysics]
    [field of study]

    The study of things, how they relate to
    other things, and what those things are
    called.
    
    However, there's an easier, less
    philosophical way of explaining what an
    ontologist does.
    
    He or she is a creator of languages.
    
    An ontologist is a language engineer.

SHACL
Shapes Constraint Language
    While languages like XML Schema are
    limited to tree structures, SHACL is based
    on RDF and supports the validation of
    graph-based and object-oriented data.
    
    Since SHACL is based on RDF, it may also
    serve as a schema language for JSON via
    its JSON-LD dialect.
    
    The examples in this Tutorial are using
    the RDF Turtle notation.
    
    We also show screenshots of TopBraid
    Composer, for those who would like to
    follow along with a graphical editing
    tool.
    
    A language for validating RDF graphs
    against a set of conditions.
        Includes features to express
        conditions that constrain the number
        of values that a property may have,
        the type of such values, numeric
        ranges, string matching patterns, and
        logical combinations of such
        constraints.
        
        Also includes an extension mechanism
        to express more complex conditions in
        languages such as SPARQL.
        
        These conditions are provided as
        shapes and other constructs expressed
        in the form of an RDF graph.
        
        RDF graphs that are used in this
        manner are called "shapes graphs" in
        SHACL and the RDF graphs that are
        validated against a shapes graph are
        called "data graphs".

    As SHACL shape graphs are used to validate
    that data graphs satisfy a set of
    conditions they can also be viewed as a
    description of the data graphs that do
    satisfy these conditions.
    
    Such descriptions may be used for a
    variety of purposes beside validation,
    including user interface building, code
    generation and data integration.
        
Terse RDF Triple Language
Turtle
    [syntax and file format]
    
    For expressing data in the RDF data model.
    
    Syntax is similar to that of SPARQL, an
    RDF query language.
    
    It is a common data format for storing RDF
    data, along with N-Triples, JSON-LD and
    RDF/XML.

SPARQL
    (pronounced "sparkle", a recursive acronym
    for SPARQL Protocol and RDF Query
    Language)

    [RDF query language]
    [semantic query language]

    For databases; able to retrieve and
    manipulate data stored in RDF format.
    
    Implementations for multiple programming
    languages exist.
    
    There exist tools that allow one to
    connect and semi-automatically construct a
    SPARQL query for a SPARQL endpoint, for
    example ViziQuer.
    
    In addâ€”tion, there exist tools that
    translate SPARQL queries to other query
    languages, for example to SQL and to
    XQuery.

KG
knowledge graph
    A representation of a set of statements in
    the form of a node- and edge-labeled
    directed multigraph allowing multiple,
    heterogeneous edges for the same nodes.
    
    A collection of definitional statements
    specifying the meaning of the knowledge
    graph's labels is called its schema.

SKOS
Simple Knowledge Organization System
    An area of work developing specifications
    and standards to support the use of KOS
    such as thesauri, classification schemes,
    subject heading systems and taxonomies
    within the framework of the Semantic Web.
    
    Provides a standard way to represent
    knowledge organization systems using the
    RDF.
    
    Encoding this information in RDF allows it
    to be passed between computer applications
    in an interoperable way.
    
    Using RDF also allows knowledge
    organization systems to be used in
    distributed, decentralised metadata
    applications.
    
    Decentralised metadata is becoming a
    typical scenario, where service providers
    want to add value to metadata harvested
    from multiple sources.

Terse RDF Triple Language
Turtle
.ttl

    find $MYGIT/RDFLib/pySHACL/test/resources/dash_tests -name '*.ttl' | pager

RDF
    Represents information using semantic
    triples, which comprise a subject,
    predicate, and object.
    
    Each item in the triple is expressed as a
    Web URI.
    
    Turtle provides a way to group three URIs
    to make a triple, and provides ways to
    abbreviate such information, for example
    by factoring out common portions of URIs.
    
    For example, information about Huckleberry
    Finn could be expressed as:

    <http://example.org/person/Mark_Twain>
       <http://example.org/relation/author>
       <http://example.org/books/Huckleberry_Finn> .
