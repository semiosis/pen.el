ranking
    Create a permutation of items in new,
    unseen lists in a similar way to rankings
    in the training data.

Learning to rank
LTR
machine-learned ranking
MLR
    The application of ML, typically
    supervised, semi-supervised or RL, in the
    construction of ranking models for IR
    systems.
    
    Training data consists of lists of items
    with some partial order specified between
    items in each list.
    
    This order is typically induced by giving
    a numerical or ordinal score or a binary
    judgment (e.g. "relevant" or "not
    relevant") for each item.
    
    The ranking model purposes to rank, i.e.
    producing a permutation of items in new,
    unseen lists in a similar way to rankings
    in the training data.
    
    Ranking is a central part of many IR
    problems, such as document retrieval,
    collaborative filtering, sentiment
    analysis, and online advertising.
