XY problem
    A communication problem encountered in
    help desk and similar situations in which
    the real issue, X, of the person asking
    for help is obscured, because instead of
    asking directly about issue X, they ask
    how to solve a secondary issue, Y, which
    they believe will allow them to resolve
    issue X.
