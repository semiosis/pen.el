oauth
    Provides granular permissions ("scopes")
    and easy ability for users (or
    administrators) to see granted tokens and
    revoke tokens/permissions at will.

Bearer Tokens
    The predominant type of access token used
    with OAuth 2.0.
    
    A Bearer Token is an opaque string, not
    intended to have any meaning to clients
    using it.
    
    Some servers will issue tokens that are a
    short string of hexadecimal characters,
    while others may use structured tokens
    such as JSON Web Tokens.
