soliton
    In mathematics and physics, a soliton or
    solitary wave is a self-reinforcing wave
    packet that maintains its shape while it
    propagates at a constant velocity.
    
    Solitons are caused by a cancellation of
    nonlinear and dispersive effects in the
    medium.

Grand Unified Theory
    [model in particle physics]

    At high energy, the three gauge
    interactions of the Standard Model that
    define the electromagnetic, weak, and
    strong interactions, or forces, are merged
    into a single force.

Grand Unified Representation

Pauli exclusion principle
    An atom’s electrons are arranged in energy
    shells.
    
    Like concertgoers in an arena, each
    electron occupies a single chair and
    cannot drop to a lower tier if all its
    chairs are occupied.
    
    This fundamental property of atomic
    physics is known as the Pauli exclusion
    principle, and it explains the shell
    structure of atoms, the diversity of the
    periodic table of elements, and the
    stability of the material universe.
    
    Now, MIT physicists have observed the
    Pauli exclusion principle, or Pauli
    blocking, in a completely new way: They’ve
    found that the effect can suppress how a
    cloud of atoms scatters light.

entropy
    The disorder of a system.

chaos
    Means that the behaviour of system (no
    randomness) is not predictable.
    
    This is the common feature with random
    system (a nose), but the rest of body is
    different.
    
    Deterministic chaos is a mathematical
    concept while randomness is essentially a
    philosophical one.

randomness


photon sieve
    A device for focusing light using
    diffraction and interference.
    
    It consists of a flat sheet of material
    full of pinholes that are arranged in a
    pattern which is similar to the rings in a
    Fresnel zone plate, but a sieve brings
    light to much sharper focus than a zone
    plate.
    
    The sieve concept, first developed in
    2001, is versatile because the
    characteristics of the focusing behaviour
    can be altered to suit the application by
    manufacturing a sieve containing holes of
    several different sizes and different
    arrangement of the pattern of holes.

    Branches the state into separate
    components.

phasor
phase vector
    [#physics and engineering]
    [complex number]
    [portmanteau of phase vector]

    A complex number representing a sinusoidal
    function whose amplitude, angular
    frequency, and initial phase are
    time-invariant.

spinor
    [#geometry]
    [#physics]
    
    Elements of a complex vector space that
    can be associated with Euclidean space.
    
    Like geometric vectors and more general
    tensors, spinors transform linearly when
    the Euclidean space is subjected to a
    slight rotation.

Boundary layer region
    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfCyzIbpLN4

    Boundary layer, in fluid mechanics, thin
    layer of a flowing gas or liquid in
    contact with a surface such as that of an
    airplane wing or of the inside of a pipe.

    The flow in such boundary layers is
    generally laminar at the leading or
    upstream portion and turbulent in the
    trailing or downstream portion.

uno
    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parts-per_notation#Uno

    The “unit” for dimensionless quantities.

sonoluminescence
    The emission of short bursts of light from
    imploding bubbles in a liquid when excited
    by sound.

thermodynamic system
    A body of matter and/or radiation,
    confined in space by walls, with defined
    permeabilities, which separate it from its
    surroundings.
    
    The surroundings may include other
    thermodynamic systems, or physical systems
    that are not thermodynamic systems.
    
    A wall of a thermodynamic system may be
    purely notional, when it is described as
    being 'permeable' to all matter, all
    radiation, and all forces.
    
    A thermodynamic system can be fully
    described by a definite set of
    thermodynamic state variables, which
    always covers both intensive and extensive
    properties.

catadioptric
    A catadioptric optical system is one where
    refraction and reflection are combined in
    an optical system, usually via lenses and
    curved mirrors.

dioptric
    Purely refractive.

Fresnel lens
    A type of composite compact lens developed
    by the French physicist Augustin-Jean
    Fresnel (1788–1827) for use in
    lighthouses.
    
    It has been called "the invention that
    saved a million ships."

    The design allows the construction of
    lenses of large aperture and short focal
    length without the mass and volume of
    material that would be required by a lens
    of conventional design.
    
    A Fresnel lens can be made much thinner
    than a comparable conventional lens, in
    some cases taking the form of a flat
    sheet.
    
    The simpler dioptric form of the lens was
    first proposed by Count Buffon, and
    independently reinvented by Fresnel.
    
    The catadioptric form of the lens,
    entirely invented by Fresnel, has outer
    elements that use total internal
    reflection as well as refraction; it can
    capture more oblique light from a light
    source and add it to the beam of a
    lighthouse, making the light visible from
    greater distances.

Maxwell's equations
    4 equations.

    A set of coupled partial differential
    equations.

    Together with the Lorentz
    force law, form the foundation of:
    - classical electromagnetism,
    - classical optics, and
    - electric circuits.

    Describe how electric and magnetic fields
    respond to charges, currents, and each
    other.

    Provide a mathematical model for:
    - electric,
    - optical, and
    - radio technologies, such as
    - power generation,
    - electric motors,
    - wireless communication,
    - lenses,
    - radar etc.

    Describe how electric and magnetic fields
    are generated by:
    - charges,
    - currents, and
    - changes
    of the fields.

    He also first used the equations to
    propose that light is an electromagnetic
    phenomenon.

Archimedes' principle
    Archimedes' principle states that the
    upward buoyant force that is exerted on a
    body immersed in a fluid, whether fully or
    partially submerged, is equal to the
    weight of the fluid that the body
    displaces.
    
    Archimedes' principle is a law of physics
    fundamental to fluid mechanics.

Centripetal force
    Force pushing towads the center.

Centrifugal force
    Force pushing outwards

Spallation
    The break-up of a bombarded nucleus into
    several parts.

    e.g. cosmic ray spallation.

r-Process
    An easier way to make heavier elements.

    Rapid.

    Add a neutron and rely on beta-decay.

    The neutron changes into a proton.

    Without having to overcome these coulomb
    repulsions.

    Doesn't always work.

s-Process
    Slow.

    [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlBG_A4Djp4][The s-Process - Sixty Symbols - YouTube]]

    This guys didn't explain it very well.

    I think it's adding neutrons and waiting
    over a long period of time -- 10,000s
    years.

Electron chirality / spin
    When he talked about the pauli-exclusion
    principle, I thought he was suggesting that
    the electron's chirality was the quantum
    spin.

    When he talked about the graphene atom
    orientations, it sounded like it wasn't
    quantum spin but something that comes from
    the electron travelling between atoms of
    different orientations.

    So I'm still unsure.

    [[https://youtu.be/46h44d3yrZQ?t=800][Left-handed Electrons - Sixty Symbols - YouTube]]

    An electron has a spin. With the
    Pauli-exclusion principle, the two
    electrons must have opposing spins.
    Remarkably, if an electron tunnels to a
    new location, via quantum tunnelling, it
    retains the same spin, paired with a
    different electron.

Pauli-exclusion principle
    No two electrons can have the same four
    electronic quantum numbers.  As an orbital
    can contain a maximum of only two
    electrons, the two electrons must have
    opposing spins.

Quantum Electrodynamics
QED
    The relativistic quantum field theory of
    electrodynamics.
    
    In essence, it describes how light and
    matter interact and is the first theory
    where full agreement between quantum
    mechanics and special relativity is
    achieved. QED mathematically describes all
    phenomena involving electrically charged
    particles interacting by means of exchange
    of photons and represents the quantum
    counterpart of classical electromagnetism
    giving a complete account of matter and
    light interaction.

    Feynman diagrams are used to describe the
    interactions of particles as they come
    together.

    One of the dimensions of the 2D diagram is
    time.

Supersymmetry
SUSY
    [proposed extension to the standard model]

        readsubs "[[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ESFGYkkbEI][Supersymmetric Particle Found? - YouTube]]"

    Provides a very natural explanation for
    the "hierarchy problem" by introducing a
    new symmetry between the fermions and the
    bosons.
    
    It's a key feature in some grand unified
    theories as well as modern string theory,
    leveling it up to superstring theory.

    Predicts:
        A one to one property.

        Every single standard model of
        particle has a supersymmetric partner
        particle of the opposite type:

        - The partners of fermions are bosons.
        - The partners of bosons are fermions.

    These supersymmetric particles are all
    expected to be way more massive than their
    known partners in the standard model.
    
LHC
    Supersymmetry:
        Hope:
            By smashing particles together
            hard enough in the Large Hadron
            Collider, there'd be enough energy
            in those collisions to produce a
            supersymmetric particle.
            
        The LHC has seen nothing.
        
        It may just be that these new
        particles are way more massive than
        expected.

    To detect more massive supersymmetric
    particles, you need higher energy particle
    collisions.

    Alternatives:
    - Cosmic rays
      Can have energies around a billion times
      that of the LHC.

String theory
    May be wrong, but it's not testable due to
    the limits of current facilities.

M-theory
    Modern string theory.

    Not particularly well-defined.

not even wrong
    Wolfgang Pauli

gravitational waves
    Appears to refute the idea of extra
    dimensions.

weakness of the gravitational force
    unusal.

    One explanation
        There is an extra special dimension that
        has the same scale as the familiar three,
        so a 4d space in which we live on an
        embedded 3D manifold called a brain.

    Gravity then leaks into the extra fourth
    dimension, causing it to weaken.

world sheet
    [string theory]
    
    2D manifold which describes the embedding
    of a string in spacetime.
    
    The term was coined by Leonard Susskind
    around 1967 as a direct generalization of
    the world line concept for a point
    particle in special and general
    relativity.
    
    The type of string, the geometry of the
    spacetime in which it propagates, and the
    presence of long-range background fields
    (such as gauge fields) are encoded in a
    two-dimensional conformal field theory
    defined on the worldsheet.
    
    For example, the bosonic string in
    26-dimensional Minkowski space has a
    worldsheet conformal field theory
    consisting of 26 free scalar fields.
    
    Meanwhile, a superstring worldsheet theory
    in 10 dimensions consists of 10 free
    scalar fields and their fermionic
    superpartners.

Casimir effect
    [#quantum field theory]

    Can't get meaningful energy from this?
    
    And the Casimir–Polder force are physical
    forces arising from a quantized field.
    
    Can be understood by the idea that the
    presence of conducting metals and
    dielectrics alters the vacuum expectation
    value of the energy of the second
    quantized electromagnetic field.
    
    Since the value of this energy depends on
    the shapes and positions of the conductors
    and dielectrics, the Casimir effect
    manifests itself as a force between such
    objects.
    
    Any medium supporting oscillations has an
    analogue of the Casimir effect.
    
    For example, beads on a string as well as
    plates submerged in noisy water or gas
    illustrate the Casimir force.
    
    Plays an important role in the chiral bag
    model of the nucleon; in applied physics
    it is significant in some aspects of
    emerging microtechnologies and
    nanotechnologies.

Cosmic rays
    Sources:
    - Supernova explosions,
    - gamma ray bursts,
    - black hole magnetic fields
    
    Examples:
    - electrons
    - atomic nuclei

    Supersymmetry:
        Not surprising that we haven't seen
        supersymmetric particles in our cosmic
        ray observations yet, or have we?

    Lose energy to the CMB.
    In those interactions, cosmic rays can
    create extremely high energy neutrinos.

    Detecting the highest energy neutrinos
    allows us to learn about the cosmic rays
    that produced them.

    Red herrings:
    - boring or muon neutrinos

neutrinos
    Ignore the CMB.

    Pass through solid matter.
    
    Lower energy neutrinos can flow right
    through the Earth as though it isn't
    there.

    Very, very rarely one will interact with
    an atomic nucleus and produce a shower of
    particles.

Pilot wave theory
Bohmian mechanics

    An interpretation of quantum mechanics.

    In addition to a wavefunction on the space
    of all possible configurationss it also
    postulates an actual configuration that
    exists even when unobserved.

Quantum field theory
    The theory that allows relativity to
    coexist with quantum mechanics.

    All possible particle trajectories should
    be considered equally real.

    This does not help pilot wave theory
    because pilot-wave theory suggests that a
    particle takes a single actual trajectory,
    the bohm trajectory.

    are more massive and they're unstable.

    Have a number of scientific uses such as
    mass spectrometry, basic physics research,
    and controlling quantum states.
    
    The two most common types of ion trap are
    the Penning trap, which forms a potential
    via a combination of electric and magnetic
    fields, and the Paul trap which forms a
    potential via a combination of static and
    oscillating electric fields.
    
    Penning traps can be used for precise
    magnetic measurements in spectroscopy.
    
    Studies of quantum state manipulation most
    often use the Paul trap.
    
    This may lead to a trapped ion quantum

spin precession
Larmor precession
    The precession of the magnetic moment of

    Objects with a magnetic moment also have

    electric current proportional to their
    angular momentum; these include electrons,
    protons, other fermions, many atomic and
    nuclear systems, as well as classical
    macroscopic systems.
    
    The external magnetic field exerts a
    torque on the magnetic moment,

blinding
blinding the data
    The concealment of group allocation from
    one or more individuals involved in a
    clinical research study, most commonly a
    RCT.
    
    Although randomization minimizes
    differences between treatment groups at
    the outset of the trial, it does nothing
    to prevent differential treatment of the
    groups later in the trial or the
    differential assessment of outcomes,
    either of which may result in biased
    estimates of treatment effects.

    Method for transporting items where items

    The method was important in firefighting
    before the advent of hand pumped fire
    engines, whereby firefighters would pass
    buckets to each other to extinguish a

    A famous example of this is the Union Fire

    This technique is still common where using
    machines to move water, supplies, or other
    items would be impractical.

    Charge, parity, and time reversal symmetry
    is a fundamental symmetry of physical laws
    under the simultaneous transformations of
    charge conjugation (C), parity
    transformation (P), and time reversal (T).
    
    CPT is the only combination of C, P, and T
    that is observed to be an exact symmetry
    of nature at the fundamental level.
    
    The CPT theorem says that CPT symmetry
    holds for all physical phenomena, or more
    precisely, that any Lorentz invariant
    local quantum field theory with a
    Hermitian Hamiltonian must have CPT
    symmetry.

plutonium
    Can be manufactured from uranium.

inertial observer
    No acceleration.
    No gravitational field.
    Laws of physics apply.

photographic emulsion
    A light-sensitive colloid used in film-
    based photography.
    
    Most commonly, in silver-gelatin
    photography, it consists of silver halide
    crystals dispersed in gelatin.
    
    The emulsion is usually coated onto a
    substrate of glass, films, paper, or
    fabric.

Seebeck Effect
    Ellows us to generate an electric current
    through a heat differential, as charge
    carriers will move from hot to cold.

    So if we have a heat source and a way of
    cooling we can generate a sustained
    electric current.
    
    Thankfully radioactive substances generate
    heat as they decay.

bond albedo
    The fraction of power in the total
    electromagnetic radiation incident on an
    astronomical body that is scattered back
    out into space.
    
    This takes into account all wavelengths.
    
    It is an important quantity for
    characterising a planetary body's energy
    balance.

Viscosity
    Resistance to flow.

    The thickness of a liquid.

    Oil is 100x more viscous than water.
    Honey is 100x more viscous than oil.

    Part (not more than) of what makes
    something sticky is it's viscousity.

Wave function
    [ for an electron in an atom ]

    Ψ -- psi

    Wave of probability.

    The wave function for an electron in an
    atom does not describe a smeared out
    electron with a smooth charge density.
    ...
    The electron is either here, or there, or
    somewhere else, but wherever it is, it is
    a point charge.
        Richard Feynman

    Even though a particle is not a wave, its
    properties are.
        Where it is, what it's doing, how much
        energy it has -- these are wave
        shaped, but they're only waves of
        probability.

    The act of measuring it does not
    completely collapse the wave function.
    There's still a little wiggle room.
        That's what the uncertainty principle
        is all about.

        The wave is collapsed to a simpler shape.

    Some of the properties can be measured
    together.
        Energy, magnitude of Angular Momentum
        and orientation of Angular Momentum,
        for example.

        These can all be measured at the same
        time but there is still a little
        spread / wiggle room, which is what
        gives emission lines their thickness.

Emission spectrum
    [...of a chemical element or compound]

    The spectrum of frequencies of
    electromagnetic radiation emitted due to
    an atom or molecule making a transition
    from a high energy state to a lower energy
    state.

    The photon energy of the emitted photon is
    equal to the energy difference between the
    two states.

Torr
atm
    1 atm = 760 Torr

radio
    The transmission and reception of
    electromagnetic waves of radio frequency,
    especially those carrying sound messages.

Huygens–Fresnel principle
    A method of analysis applied to problems
    of wave propagation both in the far-field
    limit and in near-field diffraction and
    also reflection.

Zone plate
    [#laria]

    A zone plate is a device used to focus
    light or other things exhibiting wave
    character.
    
    Unlike lenses or curved mirrors, zone
    plates use diffraction instead of
    refraction or reflection.
    
    Based on analysis by French physicist
    Augustin-Jean Fresnel, they are sometimes
    called Fresnel zone plates in his honor.

Faraday cage
Faraday shield
    An enclosure used to block electromagnetic
    fields.
    
    A Faraday shield may be formed by a
    continuous covering of conductive
    material, or in the case of a Faraday
    cage, by a mesh of such materials.
    
    Faraday cages are named after scientist
    Michael Faraday, who invented them in
    1836.

    from electricity
    
    A Faraday cage operates because an
    external electrical field causes the
    electric charges within the cage's
    conducting material to be distributed so
    that they cancel the field's effect in the
    cage's interior.
    
    This phenomenon is used to protect
    sensitive electronic equipment (for
    example RF receivers) from external radio
    frequency interference (RFI) often during
    testing or alignment of the device.
    
    They are also used to protect people and
    equipment against actual electric currents
    such as lightning strikes and
    electrostatic discharges, since the
    enclosing cage conducts current around the
    outside of the enclosed space and none
    passes through the interior.
    
    Faraday cages cannot block stable or
    slowly varying magnetic fields, such as
    the Earth's magnetic field (a compass will
    still work inside).

Foucault pendulum
Foucault's pendulum
    A simple device named after French
    physicist Léon Foucault and conceived as
    an experiment to demonstrate the Earth's
    rotation.
    
    The pendulum was introduced in 1851 and
    was the first experiment to give simple,
    direct evidence of the Earth's rotation

time crystal
    [#condensed matter physics]

    A quantum system of particles whose
    lowest-energy state is one in which the
    particles are in repetitive motion.
    
    The system cannot lose energy to the
    environment and come to rest because it is
    already in its quantum ground state.
    
    Because of this, the motion of the
    particles does not really represent
    kinetic energy like other motion; it has
    "motion without energy".
    
    Time crystals were first proposed
    theoretically by Frank Wilczek in 2012 as
    a time-based analogue to common crystals —
    whereas the atoms in crystals are arranged
    periodically in space, the atoms in a time
    crystal are arranged periodically in both
    space and time.
    
    Several different groups have demonstrated
    matter with stable periodic evolution in
    systems that are periodically driven.
    
    In terms of practical use, time crystals
    may one day be used as quantum computer
    memory.
