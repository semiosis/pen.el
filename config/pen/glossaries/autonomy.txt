ADAS
Advanced driver assistance systems
    ADAS are becoming increasingly available
    across all car lines to improve safety,
    comfort and fuel savings through engine
    efficiency.
    
    The latest generation of ADAS leverages
    data from the navigation map to anticipate
    the road ahead, allowing ADAS to make
    decisions like humans do.

    The TomTom ADAS Map content provides
    highly accurate information, including:
    gradient, curvature and speed limits – all
    backed by our connected global coverage.
    
    Like a human driver, this content allows
    ADAS to accurately anticipate changes on
    the road ahead.
    
    Features and Benefits Automated driving
    technology that sees beyond the road ahead
    
    The TomTom ADAS Map improves drivers’
    safety and comfort, optimizing powertrain
    efficiency by providing highly accurate
    content of the road ahead for driver
    assistance systems.
QNX
    A commercial Unix-like real-time operating
    system, aimed primarily at the embedded
    systems market.
    
    QNX was one of the first commercially
    successful microkernel operating systems
    and is currently used in a variety of
    devices including cars and mobile phones.
