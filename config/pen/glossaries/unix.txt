Unix domain socket
IPC socket
inter-process communication socket
    A data communications endpoint for
    exchanging data between processes
    executing on the same host operating
    system. Valid socket types in the UNIX
    domain are:
    - SOCK_STREAM (compare to TCP)
      For a stream-oriented socket
    - SOCK_DGRAM (compare to UDP)
      For a datagram-oriented socket that
      preserves message boundaries (as on most
      UNIX implementations, UNIX domain
      datagram sockets are always reliable and
      don't reorder datagrams)
    - SOCK_SEQPACKET (compare to SCTP)
      For a sequenced-packet socket that is
      connection-oriented, preserves message
      boundaries, and delivers messages in the
      order that they were sent.

      The Unix domain socket facility is a
      standard component of POSIX operating
      systems.
