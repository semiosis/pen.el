    A serialization and remote procedure call
    (RPC) framework used for cross-service
    communication.
    
    Most services at Facebook communicate via
    Thrift because it provides a simple,
    language-agnostic protocol for
    communicating with structured data.
    
    Thrift can already be used in programming
    languages such as C++, Python, and Java.
