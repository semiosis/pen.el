National Comprehensive Cancer Network
NCCN

NCCN Guidelines
    Widely recognised and used as the standard
    for clinical policy and practice in
    oncology by clinicians and payors in the
    USA.

    Cxbladder has been included in the latest
    version of the NCCN Guidelines for Bladder
    Cancer in the USA.

Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research
    Headquarters is in New York.

Pre-Clinical Trial
    [stage of research]
    
    Begins before clinical trials (testing in
    humans) can begin, and during which
    important feasibility, iterative testing
    and drug safety data are collected.

    Goals:
    - determine the safe dose for first-in-man
      study
    - assess a product's safety profile.
    
    Products may include:
    - new medical devices,
    - drugs,
    - gene therapy solutions and
    - diagnostic tools.

Pre-Clinical Trials
    [#pacific edge]

    - Gastric cancer (diagnosis)
    - Gastric cancer (triage)
    - Melanoma (prognosis)
    - Endometrial (detection)

Melanoma (prognosis)
    [signature]

    Collaboration between:
    - Pacific Edge
    - Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research

    A prognostic gene signature for the
    identification of aggressive stage II
    melanoma has been identified and validated.

    Currently undergoing clinical and user
    trials.

Gastric cancer (diagnosis)
    [product]

Gastric cancer (triage)
    Two-biomarker immunoassay
    
    For:
    - delivery at point of care

Endometrial (detection)
    [product]

    In development.

Cxbladder Resolve
    [product]

    Currently undergoing clinical and user
    trials.

    Designed to identify patients likely to
    have high grade or late stage bladder
    cancer, and provide increased clinical
    resolution.
    
    Bladder cancer is highly treatable,
    especially if identified early.
    
    This makes timely diagnosis and earlier
    intervention, particularly for aggressive
    or advanced-stage tumours, a key element
    in the clinical process to improving
    patient outcomes.

Cxcolorectal (prognosis Gen II)
    [future Cxcolorectal product]

    Currently undergoing clinical and user
    trials.

    Uses readily available tissue samples.

prognostic
    Relating to or serving to predict the
    likely course of a medical condition.

Cxcolorectal
    [prognostic gene signature]
    [test]

    Matches patients diagnosed with stage II
    or stage III colorectal cancer.
    
    Predicts the aggressiveness of the tumour,
    allowing physicians to make the best
    decision regarding treatment for the
    patient.

    Passed a clinical study in Europe.
    
    Undergoing refinement to reduce cost and
    increase ease of delivery of the service.
    
Cxcolorectal (Prognosis Gen I)
    [Cxcolorectal product]

    Completed clinical trials and is preparing
    for commercial launch.

therapeutic intervention
    An effort made by individuals or groups to
    improve the well-being of someone else who
    either is in need of help but refusing it
    or is otherwise unable to initiate or
    accept help.

biomarker
biological marker
    A measurable indicator of some biological
    state or condition.
    
    Often measured and evaluated.
    
    Used for examining:
    - normal biological processes,
    - pathogenic processes, or
    - pharmacologic responses to a therapeutic
      intervention.

diagnosis
    The identification of the nature of an
    illness or other problem by examination of
    the symptoms.

diagnostic
    Concerned with the diagnosis of illness or
    other problems.

    - cancer genetics,
    - molecular oncology,
    - bioinformatics,
    - clinical research,
    - technology commercialisation,
    - marketing and
    - sales.
    
    Discovering, building and commercialise:
    - innovative cancer diagnostic tests
    
    The tests can contribute to a clinically
    meaningful difference in:
    - detection of cancer
    - management of cancer.
    
    products
        Built from our proprietary genetic
        databases, which are used to identify
        diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers
        for cancer.

    Our intellectual property covers the areas
    of bladder, gastric, colorectal and
    endometrial cancers and melanoma; however,
    our commercial focus is on bladder cancer
    products for the short to medium term.
    
    Our wider portfolio is expected to provide
    us with further options in the future.

A single-nucleotide polymorphism
SNP

copy-number variation
CNV
    [structural variation]
    [phenomenon]
    
    Sections of the genome are repeated and
    the number of repeats in the genome varies
    between individuals in the human
    population.
    
    A type of duplication or deletion event
    that affects a considerable number of base
    pairs.

Genetic variant
    May refer to:
    - SNP
      (in case it is a common genetic variant)
    - mutation
      (in a case where it is a rare genetic
      variant)
    - copy-number variation

genetic data
    - genes
    - gene products
    - gene variants
    - phenotypes

genetic database
    One or more sets of genetic data stored
    together with software to enable users to
    retrieve genetic data, add genetic data
    and extract information from the data.

Cxbladder
    new class of bladder cancer detection and
    management tests.

    - non-invasive
    - highly effective
    - more accurate than other urine-based
      cancer tests.

    Offers a step change in how bladder cancer
    is detected and monitored, and we are
    building a suite of Cxbladder tests to
    meet different clinical needs.

Business Model
    Franchise-like.
    
    Includes our wholly owned subsidiaries and
    other licensed partners.

    Targeted specific geographies and markets
    where we expect our products can be
    readily adopted at scale.

labs
    Certified.

    Locations:
    - 1 in NZ
    - 1 in USA

    Both labs hold a Certificate of Compliance
    from the Center for Medicare & Medicaid
    Services (CMS) for Clinical Laboratory
    Improvement Amendments (CLIA), which sets
    the standards for clinical laboratory
    testing in the United States.

    This compliance enables Pacific Edge's
    labs to provide commercial services to
    clinicians and process urine samples from
    patients in the United States for
    Cxbladder.
