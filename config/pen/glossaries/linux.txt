libvterm
    [abstract terminal library]

    An abstract C99 library which implements a
    VT220 or xterm-like terminal emulator.
    
    It doesn't use any particular graphics
    toolkit or output system, instead it
    invokes callback function pointers that
    its embedding program should provide it to
    draw on its behalf.
    
    It avoids calling malloc() during normal
    running state, allowing it to be used in
    embedded kernel situations.

UPower
    A piece of middleware for power management
    on Linux systems.
    
    It enumerates power sources, maintains
    statistics and history data on them and
    notifies about status changes.
    
    It consists of a daemon, an application
    programming interface and a set of command
    line tools.

Security-Enhanced Linux
SELinux
    A Linux kernel security module that
    provides a mechanism for supporting access
    control security policies, including
    mandatory access controls (MAC).
    
    SELinux is a set of kernel modifications
    and user-space tools that have been added
    to various Linux distributions.

autoreconf
    Runs:
    - autoconf,
    - autoheader,
    - aclocal,
    - automake,
    - libtoolize,
    - and autopoint (when appropriate) repeatedly
      to update the GNU Build System in the
      specified directories and their
      subdirectories (see Subdirectories). By
      default, it only remakes those files that
      are older than their sources. The
      environment variables AUTOM4TE,
    - AUTOCONF,
      AUTOHEADER,
    - AUTOMAKE,
    - ACLOCAL,
    - AUTOPOINT,
    - LIBTOOLIZE,
    - M4,
    - and MAKE may be used to override the
      invocation of the respective tools.

CoW
COW
implicit sharing
shadowing
    Examples:
    - AUFS,
    - BTRFS,
    - Device Mapper,
    
    A resource-management technique used in
    computer programming to efficiently
    implement a "duplicate" or "copy"
    operation on modifiable resources.

    If a resource is duplicated but not modified,
    it is not necessary to create a new resource;
    the resource can be shared between the copy
    and the original.

    Modifications must still create a copy, hence
    the technique: the copy operation is deferred
    to the first write.

    By sharing resources in this way, it is
    possible to significantly reduce the resource
    consumption of unmodified copies, while adding
    a small overhead to resource-modifying
    operations.

efivarfs
    A (U)EFI variable filesystem The efivarfs
    filesystem was created to address the
    shortcomings of using entries in sysfs to
    maintain EFI variables.

Squashfs
    A compressed read-only file system for
    Linux.
    
    Squashfs compresses files, inodes and
    directories, and supports block sizes from
    4 KiB up to 1 MiB for greater compression.
    
    Several compression algorithms are
    supported.

compositor
compositing window manager
    A window manager that provides
    applications with an off-screen buffer for
    each window.
    
    The window manager composites the window
    buffers into an image representing the
    screen and writes the result into the
    display memory.

    Compositing window managers may perform
    additional processing on buffered windows,
    applying 2D and 3D animated effects such
    as blending, fading, scaling, rotation,
    duplication, bending and contortion,
    shuffling, blurring, redirecting
    applications, and translating windows into
    one of a number of displays and virtual
    desktops.
    
    Computer graphics technology allows for
    visual effects to be rendered in real time
    such as drop shadows, live previews, and
    complex animation.
    
    Since the screen is double buffered, it
    does not flicker during updates.

    The most commonly used compositing window
    managers include:

    - Linux, FreeBSD and OpenSolaris—Compiz,
      KWin, Xfwm, Enlightenment and Mutter.
    - Windows—the Desktop Window Manager
    - macOS—the Quartz Compositor

bootstrap
    In the general sense, "bootstrapping" is a
    process through which a complex system is
    set up using a much simpler system.
    
    A bootstrap system (the simpler system) is
    in itself inherently incomplete.
    
    Bootstrapping an OS ("booting it")
    includes getting the computer's firmware
    (BIOS, or equivalent) to run a simple
    program which is sometimes located on a
    fixed location on disk, which in turn
    starts more complex initialisation
    routines (see first and second stage
    bootloaders).
    
    Bootstrapping a compiler is done by
    compiling a simple compiler that can
    handle a subset of a language in which the
    full compiler is written in, possibly in
    several successive steps.
