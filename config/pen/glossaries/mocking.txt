fake vs mock
    [#TDD]

    It is easy to confuse the term *fake
    objects* with mock objects.
    
    Fakes and mocks actually mean very
    different things in the TDD community.

fake
fake object
    Have working implementations, but usually
    take some shortcut (perhaps to make the
    operations less expensive), which makes
    them not suitable for production.
    
    An in-memory file system would be an
    example of a fake.

mock
mock object
    Pre-programmed with *expectations*, which
    form a specification of the calls they are
    expected to receive.

dependency injection
    [#software engineering]

    A technique whereby one object supplies
    the dependencies of another object.
    
    A "dependency" is an object that can be
    used, for example as a service.
    
    Instead of a client specifying which
    service it will use, something tells the
    client what service to use.
    
    The "injection" refers to the passing of a
    dependency (a service) into the object (a
    client) that would use it.
    
    The service is made part of the client's
    state.
    
    Passing the service to the client, rather
    than allowing a client to build or find
    the service, is the fundamental
    requirement of the pattern.
