Site Reliability Engineer
SRE
    Responsible for availability, latency,
    performance, efficiency, change
    management, monitoring, emergency
    response, and capacity planning.
    
    Create a bridge between development and
    operations by applying a software
    engineering mindset to system
    administration topics.

    - service discovery
    - the ability to horizontally scale with ease

forward proxy
    An intermediary for its associated clients
    to contact any server.

reverse proxy

    A type of proxy server that retrieves
    resources on behalf of a client from one
    or more servers.
    
    These resources are then returned to the
    client, appearing as if they originated
    from the proxy server itself.

reverse proxy vs forward proxy
    forward proxy
        An intermediary for its associated
        clients to contact any server.

    reverse proxy
        An intermediary for its associated
        servers to be contacted by any client.
    
    In other words, a proxy acts on behalf of
    the client(s), while a reverse proxy acts
    on behalf of the server(s).

intermediary
    A person who acts as a link between people
    in order to try to bring about an
    agreement or reconciliation; a mediator.

load balancer
    [reverse proxy]

    A device that acts as a reverse proxy and
    distributes network or application traffic
    across a number of servers.
    
    Load balancers are used to increase
    capacity (concurrent users) and
    reliability of applications.

SAS
Serial Attached SCSI
    A point-to-point serial protocol that
    moves data to and from computer-storage
    devices such as hard drives and tape
    drives.
    
    SAS replaces the older Parallel SCSI bus
    technology that first appeared in the
    mid-1980s.
    
    SAS, like its predecessor, uses the
    standard SCSI command set.

vertical scaling
    Adding more resources (CPU/RAM/DISK) to
    your server (database or application
    server is still remains one) as on demand.
    
    Vertical Scaling is most commonly used in
    applications and products of middle-range
    as well as small and middle-sized
    companies.

vendor lock-in
proprietary lock-in
customer lock-in
    Makes a customer dependent on a vendor for
    products and services, unable to use
    another vendor without substantial
    switching costs.
    
    Lock-in costs that create barriers to
    market entry may result in antitrust
    action against a monopoly.

Apache Thrift
    [software framework]

    For scalable cross-language services
    development, combines a software stack
    with a code generation engine to build
    services that work efficiently and
    seamlessly between C++, Java, Python, PHP,
    Ruby, Erlang, Perl, Haskell, C#, Cocoa,
    JavaScript, Node.js, Smalltalk, OCaml and
    Delphi and other languages.

    RPC system.

    Thrift is an interface definition language
    and binary communication protocol used for
    defining and creating services for
    numerous languages. It forms a remote
    procedure call framework and was developed
    at Facebook for "scalable cross-language
    services development".

Memcached
    A general-purpose distributed memory-
    caching system.
    
    It is often used to speed up dynamic
    database-driven websites by caching data
    and objects in RAM to reduce the number of
    times an external data source must be
    read.

Colocation centre
carrier hotel
    A type of data centre where equipment,
    space, and bandwidth are available for
    rental to retail customers.
