miri
    Miri is an Undefined Behavior detection
    tool for Rust. It can run binaries and
    test suites of cargo projects and detect
    unsafe code that fails to uphold its
    safety requirements. For instance:

    - Out-of-bounds memory accesses and
      use-after-free
    - Invalid use of uninitialized data
