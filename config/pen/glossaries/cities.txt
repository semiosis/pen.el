Sanremo
    [#italy]

    Sanremo's Mediterranean climate and
    attractive seacoast setting on the Italian
    Riviera make it a popular tourist
    destination.
    
    Besides tourism, the city is active in the
    production of extra virgin-grade olive
    oil, whose regional "designation of
    origin" is protected (D.O.P.,
    Denominazione di Origine Protetta).
