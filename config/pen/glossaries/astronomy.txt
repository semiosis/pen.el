Apsis
    Apsis denotes either of the two extreme
    points in the orbit of a planetary body
    about its primary body.
    
    The plural term, "apsides," usually
    implies both apsis points; apsides can
    also refer to the distance of the extreme
    range of an object orbiting a host body.

aphelion
    The point in the orbit of an object where
    it is farthest from the Sun.
    
    The point in orbit where an object is
    nearest to the sun is called the
    perihelion.
    
    The word aphelion derives from the Greek
    words, apo meaning away, off, apart and
    Helios.

perihelion
    The point in the orbit of a planet,
    asteroid or comet that is nearest to the
    sun.
    
    It is the opposite of aphelion, which is
    the point farthest from the sun.

perigee
    The point of the orbit closest to Earth
    
apogee
    The point farthest from Earth.

trepidation
    [obsolete medieval theory]

    Hypothetical oscillation in the precession
    of the equinoxes. The theory was popular
    from the 9th to the 16th centuries. 

precession
    A change in the orientation of the
    rotational axis of a rotating body.
    
    In an appropriate reference frame it can
    be defined as a change in the first Euler
    angle, whereas the third Euler angle
    defines the rotation itself.

equinox
    Traditionally defined as the time when the
    plane of Earth's equator passes through
    the geometric center of the Sun's disk.
