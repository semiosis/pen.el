    informal, facilitated meeting between a
    victim, offender, support people and any
    other approved people, such as community
    representatives or interpreters.

    At a restorative justice conference, you
    will have the chance to:
    - take responsibility for your offending
    - apologise to your victim
    - decide how to put right the harm you’ve
      caused
    - find ways to make sure you don’t
      reoffend
