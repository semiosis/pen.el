hypergraph
    [#mathematics]

    A generalization of a graph in which an
    edge can join any number of vertices.

    In contrast, in an ordinary graph, an edge
    connects exactly two vertices.

multigraph
    [#mathematics]
    [#graph theory]

    A graph which is permitted to have
    multiple edges (also called parallel
    edges), that is, edges that have the same
    end nodes.
    
    Thus two vertices may be connected by more
    than one edge.
    
    When multiple edges connect two nodes,
    these are different edges.

factor graph
    A bipartite graph representing the
    factorization of a function.
    
    In probability theory and its
    applications, factor graphs are used to
    represent factorization of a probability
    distribution function, enabling efficient
    computations, such as the computation of
    marginal distributions through the sum-
    product algorithm.
    
    One of the important success stories of
    factor graphs and the sum-product
    algorithm is the decoding of capacity-
    approaching error-correcting codes, such
    as LDPC and turbo codes.
    
    Factor graphs generalize constraint
    graphs.
    
    A factor whose value is either 0 or 1 is
    called a constraint.
    
    A constraint graph is a factor graph where
    all factors are constraints.
    
    The max-product algorithm for factor
    graphs can be viewed as a generalization
    of the arc-consistency algorithm for
    constraint processing.

constraint graph
    [#constraint satisfaction research]
    [#artificial intelligence]
    [#operations research]

    Constraint graphs and hypergraphs are used
    to represent relations among constraints
    in a constraint satisfaction problem.
    
    A constraint graph is a special case of a
    factor graph, which allows for the
    existence of free variables.

tree
    An undirected graph in which any two
    vertices are connected by exactly one
    path, or equivalently a connected acyclic
    undirected graph.
    
forest
    An undirected graph in which any two
    vertices are connected by at most one
    path, or equivalently an acyclic
    undirected graph, or equivalently a
    disjoint union of trees.

adjacency matrix
    A square matrix used to represent a finite
    graph.
    
    The elements of the matrix indicate
    whether pairs of vertices are adjacent or
    not in the graph.

    If a pair of points i,j are adjacent then
    that cell is 1.

    rows & columns represent vertices.

    row sum = degree of the vertex that the
    row represents.
    
    In the special case of a finite simple
    graph, the adjacency matrix is a
    (0,1)-matrix with zeros on its diagonal.

incidence matrix
    One key different from an adjacency
    matrix.

    A matrix that shows the relationship
    between two classes of objects.

    If the first class is X and the second is
    Y, the matrix has one row for each element
    of X and one column for each element of Y.
    
    The entry in row x and column y is 1 if x
    and y are related (called incident in this
    context) and 0 if they are not.
    
    There are variations.
