countericonically
countericon
    NLG: A countericon is something that
    represents another thing, but does so in a
    way that is not obvious.

    For instance, a picture of a man wearing
    lipstick is a countericon for a man who wears
    lipstick.

    By extension, countericonically is the same
    thing except used in the field of symbology.

    NLG: A symbol is countericonic when it is
    used to differentiate an entity on the
    basis of qualities that are antithetical
    to those of the entity symbolized.

    For example, using the swastika to
    differentiate Buddhist temples on the
    basis of historical animosity between
    Buddhists and Nazis, or using the cross to
    differentiate Christian churches on the
    basis of historic animosity between
    Christians and pagans.
