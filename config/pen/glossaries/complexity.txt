Space complexity
Space complexity [of an algorithm]
    The amount of space (or memory) taken by
    the algorithm to run as a function of its
    input length, n. Space complexity includes
    both auxiliary space and space used by the
    input.

Auxiliary space
    Temporary or extra space used by an
    algorithm.
    
    This temporary space allocated in order to
    solve the problem.
    
    Space complexity is total space taken by
    the algorithm with respect to the input
    size.

Order 1
Constant time
O(1)
