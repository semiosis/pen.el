alabaster
    A mineral or rock that is soft, often used
    for carving, and is processed for plaster
    powder.
    
    Archaeologists and the stone processing
    industry use the word differently from
    geologists.

    A fine-grained, massive gypsum that has
    been used for centuries for statuary,
    carvings, and other ornaments.
    
    It normally is snow-white and translucent
    but can be artificially dyed; it may be
    made opaque and similar in appearance to
    marble by heat treatment.
    
    Florence, Livorno, and Milan, in Italy,
    and Berlin are important centres of the
    alabaster trade.
    
    The alabaster of the ancients was a brown
    or yellow onyx marble.

hematite
haematite
    A common iron oxide compound with the
    formula, Fe₂O₃ and is widely found in
    rocks and soils.

    Hematite crystals belong to the
    rhombohedral lattice system which is
    designated the alpha polymorph of Fe ₂O ₃.
    It has the same crystal structure as
    corundum and ilmenite.

    Indicates the presence of water in the
    past.

Gypsum
    A soft sulfate mineral composed of calcium
    sulfate dihydrate, with the chemical
    formula CaSO.4·2H2O.
    
    It is widely mined and is used as a
    fertilizer and as the main constituent in
    many forms of plaster, blackboard/sidewalk
    chalk, and drywall.

    Present on the Martian surface.

ventifact
    A rock that has been abraded, pitted,
    etched, grooved, or polished by wind-
    driven sand or ice crystals.

serpentinization
    A processes whereby rock (usually
    ultramafic) is changed, with the addition
    of water into the crystal structure of the
    minerals found within the rock.
    
    A common example is the serpentinization
    of peridotite (or dunite) into
    serpentinite (the metamorphic equivalent).

alluvium
    A deposit of clay, silt, sand, and gravel
    left by flowing streams in a river valley
    or delta, typically producing fertile
    soil.

rift
    A linear zone where the lithosphere is
    being pulled apart and is an example of
    extensional tectonics.
    
    Typical rift features are a graben,
    or more commonly a half-graben with normal
    faulting and rift-flank uplifts mainly on
    one side.

lithosphere
    The rigid outer part of the earth,
    consisting of the crust and upper mantle.

extensional tectonics
    Concerned with the structures formed by,
    and the tectonic processes associated
    with, the stretching of a planetary body's
    crust or lithosphere.

graben
    A depressed block of land is bordered by
    parallel faults.  

    A central linear downfaulted depression.

half-graben
    A geological structure bounded by a fault
    along one side of its boundaries, unlike a
    full graben where a depressed block of
    land is bordered by parallel faults.
