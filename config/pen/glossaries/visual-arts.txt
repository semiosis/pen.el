ephemera
    Any transitory written or printed matters
    that are not meant to be retained or
    preserved.

ephemeral art
    The term is usually used to describe a
    work of art that only occurs once, like a
    happening, and cannot be embodied in any
    lasting object to be shown in a museum or
    gallery.
    
    Ephemeral art first came to prominence in
    the 1960s with the Fluxus group, when
    artists like Joseph Beuys were interested
    in creating works of art that existed
    outside the gallery and museum structure
    and had no financial worth.
    
    Happenings, performances, and sound
    sculptures were all part of ephemeral art,
    as were flyers and cheap mass-produced
    items that carried subversive messages out
    into the world.

ground
    The layer used to prepare the surface of a
    painting.

Iteration
    The action or a process of iterating or
    repeating: such as a procedure in which
    repetition of a sequence of operations
    yields results successively closer to the
    desired result.

picture plane
    When an artist creates an impression of
    space within a painting the picture plane
    is the transparent division between this
    fictive internal space and the real space
    outside, in which the viewer is placed.

simulacra
    Something that replaces reality with its
    representation.

    “Simulation is no longer that of a
    territory, a referential being, or a
    substance. It is the generation by models
    of a real without origin or reality: a
    hyperreal…. It is no longer a question of
    imitation, nor duplication, nor even
    parody. It is a question of substituting
    the signs of the real for the real”

    Jean Baudrillard in The Precession of
    Simulacra (2009),

synchronous
    Happening, existing, or arising at
    precisely the same time.

Fauvism
    [artistic style]

    The style of les Fauves.

les Fauves
    [artistic movement]

    A group of early 20th-century modern
    artists whose works emphasized painterly
    qualities and strong color over the
    representational or realistic values
    retained by Impressionism.             

Naturalism
    [artistic style]

    Became one of the major trends of the
    century and, combined with realism of the
    subject, led to impressionism and modern
    art.
    
    Naturalism is often associated with plein
    air practice (painting landscapes and
    other scenes from life out-of-doors).

Cubism
    [artistic style]

    A revolutionary new approach to
    representing reality invented in around
    1907–08 by artists Pablo Picasso and
    Georges Braque.
    
    They brought different views of subjects
    (usually objects or figures) together in
    the same picture, resulting in paintings
    that appear fragmented and abstracted.
