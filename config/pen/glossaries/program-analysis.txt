reaching definition
    [#compiler theory]

    Reaching definition for a given
    instruction is an earlier instruction
    whose target variable can reach (be
    assigned to) the given one without an
    intervening assignment.

    For example, in the following code:

    d1 : y := 3
    d2 : x := y

    d1 is a reaching definition for d2.

    In the following, example, however:

    d1 : y := 3
    d2 : y := 4
    d3 : x := y

    d1 is no longer a reaching definition for
    d3, because d2 kills its reach: the value
    defined in d1 is no longer available and
    cannot reach d3.

reaching definition analysis
    A data-flow analysis which statically
    determines which definitions may reach a
    given point in the code.

IR
    [#program analysis]

SSA
Static single assignment form
    [property of an IR]

    Requires that each variable be assigned
    exactly once, and every variable be
    defined before it is used.
    
    Existing variables in the original IR are
    split into versions, new variables
    typically indicated by the original name
    with a subscript in textbooks, so that
    every definition gets its own version.
    
    In SSA form, use-def chains are explicit
    and each contains a single element.

    SSA was proposed by Barry K. Rosen, Mark
    N. Wegman, and F. Kenneth Zadeck in
    1988.[1] Ron Cytron, Jeanne Ferrante and
    the previous three researchers at IBM
    developed an algorithm that can compute
    the SSA form efficiently.[2]

    One can expect to find SSA in a compiler
    for Fortran or C, whereas in functional
    language compilers, such as those for
    Scheme and ML, continuation-passing style
    (CPS) is generally used.
    
    SSA is formally equivalent to a well-
    behaved subset of CPS excluding non-local
    control flow, which does not occur when
    CPS is used as intermediate
    representation.
    
    So optimizations and transformations
    formulated in terms of one immediately
    apply to the other.
