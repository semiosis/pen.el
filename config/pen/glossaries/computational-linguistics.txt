syntactic parsing
    The automatic analysis of syntactic
    structure of NL, especially syntactic
    relations (in dependency grammar) and
    labelling spans of constituents (in
    constituency grammar).
    
    It is motivated by the problem of
    structural ambiguity in NL: a sentence can
    be assigned multiple grammatical parses,
    so some kind of knowledge beyond
    computational grammar rules are need to
    tell which parse is intended.
    
    Syntactic parsing is one of the important
    tasks in computational linguistics and
    NLP, and has been a subject of research
    since the mid-20th century with the advent
    of computers.
    
    Different theories of grammar propose
    different formalisms for describing the
    syntactic structure of sentences.
    
    For computational purposes, these
    formalisms can be grouped under
    constituency grammars and dependency
    grammars.
    
    Parsers for either class call for
    different types of algorithms, and
    approaches to the two problems have taken
    different forms.
    
    The creation of human-annotated treebanks
    using various formalisms (e.g. Universal
    Dependencies) has proceeded alongside the
    development of new algorithms and methods
    for parsing.
    
    Part-of-speech tagging (which resolves
    some semantic ambiguity) is a related
    problem, and often a prerequisite for or a
    subproblem of syntactic parsing.
    
    Syntactic parses can be used for
    information extraction (e.g. event
    parsing, semantic role labelling, entity
    labelling) and may be further used to
    extract formal semantic representations.
