Top 2 functions
    Having Ne/Fi as your top 2 functions makes
    you (in a word) idiosyncratic.

Ni
Introverted intuition

Ni critic
Introverted intuition critic
    An internal critic in oneself.

    Critical of what we want and what we want
    to get out of life.

    Why this critic is wrong and why you
    should reject its voice (line of

    1. Ni - internal iNtuition
        Ni is like a background processor that
        can compute and process information
        without needing to consciously work
        through each part of the thought.
        
        It’s easily able to see ten steps
        ahead and predict what might happen in
        the future because.
        
        Ni-dominant types are able to access
        many parts of their brain at once to
        find an optimal solution to new
        problems.
        
        Because Ni is the NiTe’s main
        function, everything else is said to
        serve it.
