    Apart from patterns, the expect construct
    can take keywords.
    
    timout, eof and default may be used in the
    place of a pattern.

eof
    [#tcl/expect]

    [keyword]

    The corresponding body is executed upon
    end-of-file.

timeout
    [#tcl/expect]

    [keyword]
    The corresponding body is executed upon
    timeout.
    
    If no timeout keyword is used, an implicit
    null action is executed upon timeout.
    
    The default timeout period is 10 seconds
    but may be set, for example to 30, by the
    command "set timeout 30".
    
    An infinite timeout may be designated by
    the value -1.

default
    [keyword]

    The corresponding body is executed upon
    either timeout or end-of-file.
