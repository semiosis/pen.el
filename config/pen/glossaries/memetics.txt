memetics
    The study of information and culture based
    on an analogy with Darwinian evolution.
    
    Proponents describe memetics as an
    approach to evolutionary models of
    cultural information transfer.
    
    Memetics describes how an idea can
    propagate successfully, but doesn't
    necessarily imply a concept is factual.
    
    Critics contend the theory is "untested,
    unsupported or incorrect".
    
    It has been labelled as pseudoscience by
    many scholars, making memetics unable to
    establish itself as a recognized research
    program.
    
    The term meme was coined in Richard
    Dawkins' 1976 book The Selfish Gene, but
    Dawkins later distanced himself from the
    resulting field of study.

memeplex
meme-complex
    A collection or grouping of memes that
    have evolved into a mutually supportive or
    symbiotic relationship.
    
    Simply put, a meme-complex is a set of
    ideas that reinforce each other.
    
    Meme-complexes are roughly analogous to
    the symbiotic collection of individual
    genes that make up the genetic codes of
    biological organisms.
    
    An example of a memeplex would be a
    religion.

meme pool
    A population of interbreeding memes.

memetic engineering
    The process of deliberately creating
    memes, using engineering principles.

memetic algorithms
    An approach to evolutionary computation
    that attempts to emulate cultural
    evolution in order to solve optimization
    problems.

memotype
    The actual information-content of a meme.

memeoid
    A neologism for people who have been taken
    over by a meme to the extent that their
    own survival becomes inconsequential.
    
    Examples include kamikazes, suicide
    bombers and cult members who commit mass
    suicide.
    
    But in the strict sense all people are
    essentially memeoid, since no distinction
    can be made if one uses language, or memes
    use their host.
    
    In The Electronic Revolution William S.
    Burroughs writes:
        "the word has not been recognised as a
        virus because it has achieved a state
        of stable symbiosis with the host."

memetic equilibrium
    The cultural equivalent of species
    biological equilibrium.
    
    It is that which humans strive for in
    terms of personal value with respect to
    cultural artefacts and ideas.
    
    The term was coined by Christopher
    diCarlo.

metamemetic thinking
    The thinking skill & cognitive training
    capable of making individuals acknowledge
    illogical memes.

eumemics
    The belief and practice of deliberately
    improving the quality of the meme pool.

memocide
    Intentional action to eradicate a meme or
    memeplex from the population, either by
    killing its carriers or by censorship.
