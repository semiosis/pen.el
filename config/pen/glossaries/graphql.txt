GraphQL
    NLG: A query language for APIs and a
    runtime for fulfilling those queries with
    your existing data.

graphql edge
    Some objects in Github's GraphQL API have
    so called connections. Think of these as
    lists of other objects related to the
    object in question. As Github's
    documentation says, "It's helpful to
    picture a graph: dots connected by lines.
    The dots are nodes, the lines are edges. A
    connection defines a relationship between
    nodes".

GraphQL query language
    Basically all about selecting fields on
    objects.

    - fragment
      Let you construct a set of fields, and
      then include them in queries where you
      need to.

    - spread operator (...)
      Fragments are consumed by using the
      spread operator (...). All fields
      selected by the fragment will be added
      to the query field selection at the same
      level as the fragment invocation. This
      happens through multiple levels of
      fragment spreads.

GraphQL schema language
Type language
    Similar to the query language.

    Use it to define GraphQL APIs.

    GraphQL services can be written in any
    language, so we use the schema language as
    an abstraction.

    - String!
      The exclamation mark means that the
      field is non-nullable.
