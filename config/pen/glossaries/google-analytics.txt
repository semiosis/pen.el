Tag Manager
    Google Tag Manager is a tag management
    system (TMS) that allows you to quickly
    and easily update measurement codes and
    related code fragments collectively known
    as tags on your website or mobile app.
    
    Once the small segment of Tag Manager code
    has been added to your project, you can
    safely and easily deploy analytics and
    measurement tag configurations from a web-
    based user interface.
    
    When Tag Manager is installed, your
    website or app will be able to communicate
    with the Tag Manager servers.
    
    You can then use Tag Manager's web-based
    user interface to set up tags, establish
    triggers that cause your tag to fire when
    certain events occur, and create variables
    that can be used to simplify and automate
    your tag configurations.
    
    A collection of tags, triggers, variables,
    and related configurations installed on a
    given website or mobile app is called a
    container.
    
    A Tag Manager container can replace all
    other manually-coded tags on a site or
    app, including tags from Google Ads,
    Google Analytics, Floodlight, and 3rd
    party tags.
