locksmithing
    The science and art of making and
    defeating locks.
    
    Locksmithing is a traditional trade and in
    many countries requires completion of an
    apprenticeship.
    
    The level of formal education legally
    required varies from country to country
    from none at all, to a simple training
    certificate awarded by an employer, to a
    full diploma from an engineering college
    (such as in Australia), in addition to
    time spent working as an apprentice.

pin tumbler
pin tumbler lock
    A lock mechanism that uses pins of varying
    lengths to prevent the lock from opening
    without the correct key.
    
    Pin tumblers are most commonly employed in
    cylinder locks, but may also be found in
    tubular pin tumbler locks (also known as
    radial locks or ace locks).

disc detainer
disc detainer lock
    A lock composed of slotted rotating
    detainer discs.
    
    The lock was invented by Finnish founder
    of Abloy, Emil Henriksson (1886â€“1959) in
    1907 and first manufactured under the
    Abloy brand in 1918.

lever tumbler
lever tumbler lock
    A type of lock that uses a set of levers
    to prevent the bolt from moving in the
    lock.
    
    In the simplest form of these, lifting the
    tumbler above a certain height will allow
    the bolt to slide past.
    
    The number of levers may vary, but is
    usually an odd number for a lock that can
    be opened from each side of the door in
    order to provide symmetry.
    
    A minimum number of levers may be
    specified to provide an anticipated level
    of security (see five-lever locks
    section).
