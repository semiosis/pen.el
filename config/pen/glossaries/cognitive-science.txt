Winograd schema
Winograd schema challenge
WSC
    A test of machine intelligence proposed by
    Hector Levesque, a computer scientist at
    the University of Toronto.
    
    Designed to be an improvement on the
    Turing test, it is a multiple-choice test
    that employs questions of a very specific
    structure: they are instances of what are
    called Winograd schemas, named after Terry
    Winograd, professor of CS at Stanford
    University.
    
    On the surface, Winograd schema questions
    simply require the resolution of anaphora:
    the machine must identify the antecedent
    of an ambiguous pronoun in a statement.
    
    This makes it a task of NLP, but Levesque
    argues that for Winograd schemas, the task
    requires the use of knowledge and
    commonsense reasoning.
