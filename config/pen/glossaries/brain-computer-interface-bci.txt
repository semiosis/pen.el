cyberpathy
cyberpathic
    A psychic ability to control electronic
    machinery and/or read electronic signals,
    especially software.

mammalian neocortex
    Neural decoding research generally centers
    around this.

Reconstruction
    [#neural decoding]

    Ability of the researcher to predict what
    sensory stimuli the subject is receiving
    based purely on neuron action potentials.

neural decoding
    [#neuroscience]
    [field of study]

    The hypothetical reconstruction of sensory
    and other stimuli from information that
    has already been encoded and represented
    in the brain by networks of neurons.
    
    Main goal:
        To characterize how the electrical
        activity of neurons elicit activity
        and responses in the brain.

Crosstalk
    Unintended brain activations that
    interfere with bimanual actions and could
    also occur during motor imagery.

Bimanual coordination
    Encompasses a large class of situations in
    which the brain must simultaneously
    control multiple movements, such as when
    we use our two hands to manipulate an
    object or perform a task.
    
    Bimanual coordination has been one of the
    most widely studied problems in motor
    control.

Pairwise classification
    A class binarization procedure that
    converts a multi-class problem into a
    series of two-class problems, one problem
    for each pair of classes.

Motor imagery
    A dynamic state during which an individual
    mentally simulates a physical action.

    This type of phenomenal experience implies
    that the subject feels themselves
    performing the action.
