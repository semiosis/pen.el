;; Explanation
;;
;; Button-lock is a minor mode which provides simple facilities to
;; define clickable text based on regular expressions.  Button-lock.el
;; piggybacks on font-lock.el, and is efficient.  Overlays are not
;; used.
;;
;; Button-lock buttons (links) can execute any function.
;;
;; There is little user-level interface for button-lock.el, which is
;; intended to be used from Emacs Lisp.  For a user-friendly library
;; built on top of button-lock.el, see wiki-nav.el or fixmee.el

;;     ;; button-lock-unset-button
;;     (button-lock-unset-button "hello" 'beginning-of-line)
;;
;;     ;; or, save the result and pass it back to the unset function

;; Interface
;;
;; Button-lock is intended to be used via the following functions
;;
;;     `button-lock-set-button'
;;     `button-lock-unset-button'
;;     `button-lock-extend-binding'
;;     `button-lock-clear-all-buttons'
;;     `button-lock-register-global-button'
;;     `button-lock-unregister-global-button'
;;     `button-lock-unregister-all-global-buttons'

;;
;; Notes
;;
;;     By default, button-lock uses newfangled left-clicks rather than
;;     Emacs-traditional middle clicks.
;;
;;     Font lock is very efficient, but it is still possible to bog
;;     things down if you feed it expensive regular expressions.  Use
;;     anchored expressions, and be careful about backtracking.  See
;;     `regexp-opt'.
;;
;;     Some differences between button-lock.el and hi-lock.el:
;;
;;         * The purpose of hi-lock.el is to change the _appearance_
;;           of keywords.  The purpose of button-lock is to change the
;;           _bindings_ on keywords.
;;
;;         * Hi-lock also supports embedding new keywords in files,
;;           which is too risky of an approach for button-lock.
;;
;;         * Hi-lock supports overlays and can work without font-lock.
;;
;;     Some differences between button-lock.el and buttons.el
;;
;;         * Buttons.el is for inserting individually defined
;;           buttons.  Button-lock.el is for changing all matching text
;;           into a button.
;;
;; Compatibility and Requirements
;;
;;     No external dependencies
;;
;; Bugs
;;
;;     Case-sensitivity of matches depends on how font-lock-defaults
;;     was called for the current mode (setting
;;     font-lock-keywords-case-fold-search).  So, it is safest to
;;     assume that button-lock pattern matches are case-sensitive --
;;     though they might not be.
;;
;;     Return value for button-lock-register-global-button is inconsistent
;;     with button-lock-set-button.  The global function does not
;;     return a button which could be later passed to
;;     button-lock-extend-binding, nor are the arguments parsed and
;;     checked for validity.  Any errors for global buttons are also
;;     deferred until the mode is activated.
;;
;;     This package is generally incompatible with interactive modes
;;     such as `comint-mode' and derivatives, due conflicting uses
;;     of the rear-nonsticky text property.  To change this, :rear-sticky
;;     can be set when `calling button-lock-set-button'.  See also
;;     https://github.com/rolandwalker/fixmee/issues/8#issuecomment-75397467 .
;;
;; TODO
;;
;;     Validate arguments to button-lock-register-global-button.
;;     maybe split set-button into create/set functions, where
;;     the create function does all validation and returns a
;;     button object.  Pass in button object to unset as well.
;;
;;     Why are mouse and keyboard separate, can't mouse be passed
;;     through kbd macro?  The issue may have been just surrounding
;;     mouse events with "<>" before passing to kbd.
;;
;;     Look into new syntax-propertize-function variable (Emacs 24.x).
;;
;;     A refresh function to toggle every buffer?
;;
;;     Peek into font-lock-keywords and deduplicate based on the
;;     stored patterns.
;;
;;     Substitute a function for regexp to make properties invisible
;;     unless button-lock mode is on - esp for keymaps.
;;
;;     Add predicate argument to button-set where predicate is
;;     evaluated during matcher.  This could be used to test for
;;     comment-only.
;;
;;     Consider defining mode-wide button locks (pass the mode as the
;;     first argument of font-lock-add-keywords).  Could use functions
;;     named eg button-lock-set-modal-button.
;;
;;     Add a language-specific navigation library (header files in C,
;;     etc).
;;
;;     Example of exchanging text values on wheel event.
;;
;;     Convenience parameters for right-click menus.
;;
;;     Button-down visual effects as with Emacs widgets.

"Attach mouse actions to text via `font-lock-mode'.

Required argument PATTERN is a regular expression to match.

Required argument ACTION is a function to call when the matching
text is clicked.  A quoted function name or a lambda expression
may be given.  The function called by ACTION must be interactive.
If ACTION is not valid the user may experience a silent failure.

If the function called by ACTION uses (interactive \"e\") it may
receive the relevant mouse event.  Note that you may wish to use
the mouse event to reposition the point.

ACTION may alternatively contain a prepared keymap, in which case
the convenience parameters :MOUSE-BINDING, :KEYBOARD-BINDING,
and :KEYBOARD-ACTION will be ignored.

Following PATTERN and ACTION is a Common Lisp-style series of
keyword/value arguments:

Setting :NO-REPLACE causes the function to have no effect when
a button already exists using the given PATTERN.  By default,
any existing button using PATTERN will be replaced.

:FACE is a font face to set on matching text, like hi-lock mode.
By default, :FACE has no properties, and :FACE-POLICY is :APPEND.
This means that other, existing text properties will take
priority, and that clickable text will not be distinguished
without a mouseover.  To change this, try adding the arguments
\":face 'link :face-policy 'prepend.\" Alternatively,
`button-lock-face' may be customized.

:MOUSE-FACE is the font face to set on mouseovers.  It defaults
to `button-lock-mouse-face'.

:FACE-POLICY sets the override policy for button faces.  Useful
values are nil, 'keep, 'prepend, and 'append (the default).  See
the documentation for OVERRIDE in `font-lock-keywords'.

:HELP-ECHO is applied to the 'help-echo text property, and may
become visible in a tooltip depending on your Emacs setup.
:HELP-TEXT is a deprecated synonym.

:KBD-HELP is applied to the 'kbd-help text property, accessible
to the user via `display-local-help',

:KBD-HELP-MULTILINE is applied to the non-standard
'kbd-help-multiline text property.

:GROUPING designates a subgroup in the pattern match to receive
the new text properties.  Subgroups, delimited by parentheses,
are numbered from 1.  The default :GROUPING is 0, indicating the
entire match.

:MOUSE-BINDING sets the mouse event which will invoke ACTION.
The default is 'mouse-1.

:KEYBOARD-BINDING sets a keyboard event which will invoke ACTION.
The format is as accepted by `kbd'.  The default is nil, meaning
no keyboard binding is in effect.  If this is set, it might also
be wise to alert the user by setting :FACE.  Note, the only
difference between :MOUSE-BINDING and :KEYBOARD-BINDING is
that :KEYBOARD-BINDING is interpreted by `kbd'.  It is possible
to pass keyboard events into :MOUSE-BINDING and vice versa.

:KEYBOARD-ACTION is an alternate event to be run by
:KEYBOARD-BINDING.  The default is nil, meaning that
:KEYBOARD-BINDING will invoke ACTION.  This is intended for cases
where ACTION is dependent on the position of the mouse.

:ADDITIONAL-PROPERTY defines an arbitrary text property which
will be set to t in for text which matches PATTERN, as optionally
modified by :GROUPING. The property 'button-lock will always be
set.

As a convenience, :MOUSE-2 through :MOUSE-5 can be used to attach
an alternate ACTION, as can :M-MOUSE-1 ..., :A-MOUSE-1 ...,
:DOUBLE-MOUSE-1 ..., :WHEEL-UP..., and :WHEEL-DOWN... The list is not
exhaustive.  For a general method of adding alternate bindings, pass
a keymap for :ACTION or use `button-lock-extend-binding'.

If :REAR-STICKY is non-nil, the rear-nonsticky text property will
not be added, as it is by default.  Changing this setting is not
recommended.

If :REMOVE is non-nil, any existing button using PATTERN will
be removed and forgotten by font-lock.

If successful, this function returns the button which was added
or removed from `font-lock-keywords'. Otherwise it returns nil.
The button value can be passed to `button-lock-extend-binding'."
