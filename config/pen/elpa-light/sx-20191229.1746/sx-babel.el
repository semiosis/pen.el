;;; Commentary:

;; This file contains functions and a variable for font-locking the
;; content of markdown pre blocks according to their language. The
;; main configuration point, for both the user and the developer is
;; the variable `sx-babel-major-mode-alist', which see.


;;; Code:
(require 'sx-button)

(defvar sx-babel-major-mode-alist
  `((,(rx (or "*" "#+")) org-mode)
    (,(rx (or "[" "(" ";" "#(")) emacs-lisp-mode)
    ;; @TODO: Make shell-mode work here. Currently errors because it
    ;; needs a process. `sh-mode' isn't as nice.
    (,(rx (or "$ " "# ")) sh-mode)
    ;; Not sure if leaving out "[{" might lead to false positives.
    (,(rx "\\" (+ alnum) (any "[{")) latex-mode)
    ;; Right now, this will match a lot of stuff. Once we are capable
    ;; of determining major-mode from tags, site, and comments, this
    ;; will work as a last case fallback.
    (,(rx (or (and "int" (+ space) "main" (* space) "("))) c-mode)
    )
  "List of cons cells determining which major-mode to use when.
Each car is a rule and each cdr is a major-mode.  The first rule
which is satisfied activates the major-mode.

Point is moved to the first non-blank character before testing
the rule, which can either be a string or a function.  If it is a
string, is tested as a regexp starting from point.  If it is a
function, is called with no arguments and should return non-nil
on a match.")
