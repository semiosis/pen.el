;;; Commentary:

;; This global minor mode provides a simple way to switch between layouts and
;; the buffers you left open before you switched (unless you closed it).

;; It doesn't require any setup at all more than:
;; (0blayout-mode)

;; When you start Emacs with 0blayout loaded, you will have a default layout
;; named "default", and then you can create new layouts (<prefix> C-c), switch
;; layouts (<prefix> C-b), and kill the current layout (<prefix> C-k).
;; The default <prefix> is (C-c C-l), but you can change it using:
;; (0blayout-add-keybindings-with-prefix "<your prefix>")

;; You can also customize-variable to change the name of the default session.

;; The project is hosted at https://github.com/etu/0blayout
;; There you can leave bug-reports and suggestions.

;; Another comparable mode is eyebrowse which have been developed for longer.
