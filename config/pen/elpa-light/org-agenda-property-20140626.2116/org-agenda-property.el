;; Version: 1.3.2
;; Package-Requires: ((emacs "24.2"))
;; Keywords: calendar 
;; Separator: -
;; ShortName: org-agenda-property

;;; Commentary:

;; org-agenda-property is a package which displays the properties of
;; an org item beside (or below) the item's title in the agenda
;; buffer. Customize the variable `org-agenda-property-list' to add
;; which properties you which to show.

;;; Instructions:

;; INSTALLATION

;;	If you installed from Melpa, you shouldn't need to do anything
;;	else. Just customize `org-agenda-property-list' and call your
;;	agenda buffer (tipically `org-agenda-list') to see the magic.

;;      If you installed manually, just make sure it's in your
;;      load-path and call
;;		(require 'org-agenda-property)

;; Variables
;; 
;; 	All variables can be edited by running
;; 	`org-agenda-property-customize' (seriously, chech it out, they
;; 	are just a few :-)). The documentations are mostly self
;; 	explanatory, I list here only the most important two.

;;	`org-agenda-property-list'
;;              This should be a list of all properties you want
;;              displayed in the buffer. Default is "LOCATION".

;; 	`org-agenda-property-position'
;; 		This is where you want the properties to be displayed
;; 		(besides the title or below the title?).
