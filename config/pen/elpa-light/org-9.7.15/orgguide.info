1 Introduction
**************

Org is a mode for keeping notes, maintaining TODO lists, and doing
project planning with a fast and effective plain-text system.  It is
also an authoring and publishing system, and it supports working with
source code for literal programming and reproducible research.

   This document is a much compressed derivative of the *note
comprehensive Org mode manual: (org)Top.  It contains all basic features
and commands, along with important hints for customization.  It is
intended for beginners who would shy back from a 200 pages manual
because of sheer size.

Installation
============

     Important: If you are using a version of Org that is part of the
     Emacs distribution, please skip this section and go directly to
     *note Activation::.

   If you have downloaded Org from the web, either as a distribution
‘.zip’ or ‘.tar’ file, or as a Git archive, it is best to run it
directly from the distribution directory.  You need to add the ‘lisp/’
subdirectories to the Emacs load path.  To do this, add the following
line to your Emacs init file:

     (add-to-list 'load-path "~/path/to/orgdir/lisp")

If you have been using git or a tar ball to get Org, you need to run the
following command to generate autoload information.

     make autoloads

Activation
==========

Add the following lines to your Emacs init file to define _global_ keys
for three commands that are useful in any Emacs buffer, not just Org
buffers.  Please choose suitable keys yourself.

     (global-set-key (kbd "C-c l") #'org-store-link)
     (global-set-key (kbd "C-c a") #'org-agenda)
     (global-set-key (kbd "C-c c") #'org-capture)

   Files with extension ‘.org’ will be put into Org mode automatically.

Feedback
========

If you find problems with Org, or if you have questions, remarks, or
ideas about it, please mail to the Org mailing list
<mailto:emacs-orgmode@gnu.org>.  For information on how to submit bug
reports, see the *note main manual: (org)Top.

2 Document Structure
********************

Org is an outliner.  Outlines allow a document to be organized in a
hierarchical structure, which, least for me, is the best representation
of notes and thoughts.  An overview of this structure is achieved by
folding, i.e., hiding large parts of the document to show only the
general document structure and the parts currently being worked on.  Org
greatly simplifies the use of outlines by compressing the entire show
and hide functionalities into a single command, ‘org-cycle’, which is
bound to the ‘<TAB>’ key.

* Visibility Cycling::           Show and hide, much simplified.

* Plain Lists::                  Additional structure within an entry.


File: orgguide.info,  Node: Headlines,  Next: Visibility Cycling,  Up: Document Structure

2.1 Headlines
=============

Headlines define the structure of an outline tree.  The headlines in Org
start on the left margin(1) with one or more stars followed by a space.
For example:

     * Top level headline
     ** Second level
     *** Third level
         some text
     *** Third level
         more text
     * Another top level headline

   Note that a headline named after ‘org-footnote-section’, which
defaults to ‘Footnotes’, is considered as special.  A subtree with this
headline will be silently ignored by exporting functions.

   Some people find the many stars too noisy and would prefer an outline
that has whitespace followed by a single star as headline starters.  See
*note Miscellaneous:: for a setup to realize this.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) See the variable ‘org-special-ctrl-a/e’ to configure special
behavior of ‘C-a’ and ‘C-e’ in headlines.


File: orgguide.info,  Node: Visibility Cycling,  Next: Motion,  Prev: Headlines,  Up: Document Structure

2.2 Visibility Cycling
======================

Outlines make it possible to hide parts of the text in the buffer.  Org
uses just two commands, bound to ‘<TAB>’ and ‘S-<TAB>’ (‘org-cycle’ and
‘org-shifttab’) to change the visibility in the buffer.

‘<TAB>’ (‘org-cycle’)
     _Subtree cycling_: Rotate current subtree among the states

          ,-> FOLDED -> CHILDREN -> SUBTREE --.
          '-----------------------------------'

     When called with a prefix argument (‘C-u <TAB>’), or with the Shift
     key, global cycling is invoked.

‘S-<TAB>’ (‘org-global-cycle’)
‘C-u <TAB>’ (‘org-cycle’)
     _Global cycling_: Rotate the entire buffer among the states

          ,-> OVERVIEW -> CONTENTS -> SHOW ALL --.
          '--------------------------------------'

‘C-u C-u C-u <TAB>’ (‘org-show-all’)
     Show all, including drawers.

   When Emacs first visits an Org file, the global state is set to
‘showeverything’, i.e., all file content is visible.  This can be
configured through the variable ‘org-startup-folded’, or on a per-file
basis by adding a ‘STARTUP’ keyword to ‘overview’, ‘content’, ‘showall’,
‘showeverything’ or ‘show<n>levels’ (n = 2..5) like this:

     #+STARTUP: content

2.3 Motion
==========

The following commands jump to other headlines in the buffer.

‘C-c C-n’ (‘org-next-visible-heading’)
     Next heading.
‘C-c C-p’ (‘org-previous-visible-heading’)
     Previous heading.

‘C-c C-f’ (‘org-backward-heading-same-level’)
     Next heading same level.

‘C-c C-b’ (‘outline-backward-same-level’)
     Previous heading same level.

‘C-c C-u’ (‘outline-up-heading’)
     Backward to higher level heading.


File: orgguide.info,  Node: Structure Editing,  Next: Sparse Trees,  Prev: Motion,  Up: Document Structure

2.4 Structure Editing
=====================

‘M-<RET>’ (‘org-meta-return’)
     Insert new heading with same level as current.  If point is in a
     plain list item, a new item is created (see *note Plain Lists::).
     When this command is used in the middle of a line, the line is
     split and the rest of the line becomes the new headline(1).

‘M-S-<RET>’ (‘org-insert-todo-heading’)
     Insert new TODO entry with same level as current heading.

‘<TAB>’ (‘org-cycle’) in new
empty entry
     In a new entry with no text yet, ‘<TAB>’ cycles through reasonable
     levels.

‘M-<LEFT>’ (‘org-metaleft’)
‘M-<RIGHT>’ (‘org-metaright’)
     Promote or demote current heading by one level.

‘M-<UP>’ (‘org-move-subtree-up’)
‘M-<DOWN>’ (‘org-move-subtree-down’)
     Move subtree up or down, i.e., swap with previous or next subtree
     of same level.

‘C-c C-w’ (‘org-refile’)
     Refile entry or region to a different location.  See *note Refile
     and Copy::.

‘C-x n s’ (‘org-narrow-to-subtree’)
‘C-x n w’ (‘widen’)
     Narrow buffer to current subtree and widen it again.

   When there is an active region (Transient Mark mode), promotion and
demotion work on all headlines in the region.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) If you do not want the line to be split, customize the variable
‘org-M-RET-may-split-line’.


File: orgguide.info,  Node: Sparse Trees,  Next: Plain Lists,  Prev: Structure Editing,  Up: Document Structure

2.5 Sparse Trees
================

An important feature of Org mode is the ability to construct _sparse
trees_ for selected information in an outline tree, so that the entire
document is folded as much as possible, but the selected information is
made visible along with the headline structure above it(1).  Just try it
out and you will see immediately how it works.

   Org mode contains several commands creating such trees, all these
commands can be accessed through a dispatcher:

‘C-c /’ (‘org-sparse-tree’)
     This prompts for an extra key to select a sparse-tree creating
     command.

‘C-c / r’ (‘org-occur’)
     Occur.  Prompts for a regexp and shows a sparse tree with all
     matches.  Each match is also highlighted; the highlights disappear
     by pressing ‘C-c C-c’.

     The other sparse tree commands select headings based on TODO
     keywords, tags, or properties and will be discussed later in this
     manual.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) See also the variable ‘org-show-context-detail’ to decide how
much context is shown around each match.


File: orgguide.info,  Node: Plain Lists,  Prev: Sparse Trees,  Up: Document Structure

2.6 Plain Lists
===============

Within an entry of the outline tree, hand-formatted lists can provide
additional structure.  They also provide a way to create lists of
checkboxes (see *note Checkboxes::).  Org supports editing such lists,
and every exporter (see *note Exporting::) can parse and format them.

   Org knows ordered lists, unordered lists, and description lists.

   • _Unordered_ list items start with ‘-’, ‘+’, or ‘*’ as bullets.

   • _Ordered_ list items start with ‘1.’, or ‘1)’.

   • _Description_ list use ‘::’ to separate the _term_ from the
     description.

   Items belonging to the same list must have the same indentation on
the first line.  An item ends before the next line that is indented like
its bullet/number, or less.  A list ends when all items are closed, or
before two blank lines.  An example:

     * Lord of the Rings
       My favorite scenes are (in this order)
       1. The attack of the Rohirrim
       2. Eowyn's fight with the witch king
          + this was already my favorite scene in the book
          + I really like Miranda Otto.
       Important actors in this film are:
       - Elijah Wood :: He plays Frodo
       - Sean Astin :: He plays Sam, Frodo's friend.

   The following commands act on items when point is in the first line
of an item (the line with the bullet or number).

‘<TAB>’ (‘org-cycle’)
     Items can be folded just like headline levels.

‘M-<RET>’ (‘org-insert-heading’)
     Insert new item at current level.  With a prefix argument, force a
     new heading (see *note Structure Editing::).

‘M-S-<RET>’ (‘org-insert-todo-heading’)
     Insert a new item with a checkbox (see *note Checkboxes::).

‘M-<UP>’ (‘org-move-item-up’)
‘M-<DOWN>’ (‘org-move-item-down’)
     Move the item including subitems up/down (swap with previous/next
     item of same indentation).  If the list is ordered, renumbering is
     automatic.

‘M-<LEFT>’ (‘org-do-promote’)
‘M-<RIGHT>’ (‘org-do-demote’)
     Decrease/increase the indentation of an item, leaving children
     alone.

‘M-S-<LEFT>’ (‘org-promote-subtree’)
‘M-S-<RIGHT>’ (‘org-demote-subtree’)
     Decrease/increase the indentation of the item, including subitems.

‘C-c C-c’ (‘org-toggle-checkbox’)
     If there is a checkbox (see *note Checkboxes::) in the item line,
     toggle the state of the checkbox.  Also verify bullets and
     indentation consistency in the whole list.

‘C-c -’ (‘org-cycle-list-bullet’)
     Cycle the entire list level through the different itemize/enumerate
     bullets (‘-’, ‘+’, ‘*’, ‘1.’, ‘1)’).


File: orgguide.info,  Node: Tables,  Next: Hyperlinks,  Prev: Document Structure,  Up: Top

3 Tables
********

Org comes with a fast and intuitive table editor.  Spreadsheet-like
calculations are supported in connection with the Emacs Calc package
(see *note GNU Emacs Calculator Manual: (calc)Top.).

   Org makes it easy to format tables in plain ASCII.  Any line with ‘|’
as the first non-whitespace character is considered part of a table.
‘|’ is also the column separator.  A table might look like this:

     | Name  | Phone | Age |
     |-------+-------+-----|
     | Peter |  1234 |  17 |
     | Anna  |  4321 |  25 |

   A table is re-aligned automatically each time you press ‘<TAB>’ or
‘<RET>’ or ‘C-c C-c’ inside the table.  ‘<TAB>’ also moves to the next
field (‘<RET>’ to the next row) and creates new table rows at the end of
the table or before horizontal lines.  The indentation of the table is
set by the first line.  Any line starting with ‘|-’ is considered as a
horizontal separator line and will be expanded on the next re-align to
span the whole table width.  So, to create the above table, you would
only type

     |Name|Phone|Age|
     |-

and then press ‘<TAB>’ to align the table and start filling in fields.
Even faster would be to type ‘|Name|Phone|Age’ followed by ‘C-c <RET>’.

   When typing text into a field, Org treats ‘<DEL>’, ‘Backspace’, and
all character keys in a special way, so that inserting and deleting
avoids shifting other fields.  Also, when typing _immediately after
point was moved into a new field with ‘<TAB>’, ‘S-<TAB>’ or ‘<RET>’_,
the field is automatically made blank.

Creation and conversion
=======================

‘C-c |’ (‘org-table-create-or-convert-from-region’)
     Convert the active region to table.  If every line contains at
     least one ‘<TAB>’ character, the function assumes that the material
     is tab separated.  If every line contains a comma, comma-separated
     values (CSV) are assumed.  If not, lines are split at whitespace
     into fields.

     If there is no active region, this command creates an empty Org
     table.  But it is easier just to start typing, like ‘| N a m e | P
     h o n e | A g e <RET> | - <TAB>’.

Re-aligning and field motion
============================

‘C-c C-c’ (‘org-table-align’)
     Re-align the table without moving point.

‘<TAB>’ (‘org-table-next-field’)
     Re-align the table, move to the next field.  Creates a new row if
     necessary.

‘S-<TAB>’ (‘org-table-previous-field’)
     Re-align, move to previous field.

‘<RET>’ (‘org-table-next-row’)
     Re-align the table and move down to next row.  Creates a new row if
     necessary.

‘S-<UP>’ (‘org-table-move-cell-up’)
‘S-<DOWN>’ (‘org-table-move-cell-down’)
‘S-<LEFT>’ (‘org-table-move-cell-left’)
‘S-<RIGHT>’ (‘org-table-move-cell-right’)
     Move a cell up, down, left, and right by swapping with adjacent
     cell.

Column and row editing
======================

‘M-<LEFT>’ (‘org-table-move-column-left’), ‘M-<RIGHT>’ (‘org-table-move-column-right’)
     Move the current column left/right.

‘M-S-<LEFT>’ (‘org-table-delete-column’)
     Kill the current column.

‘M-S-<RIGHT>’ (‘org-table-insert-column’)
     Insert a new column to the left of point position.

‘M-<UP>’ (‘org-table-move-row-up’), ‘M-<DOWN>’ (‘org-table-move-row-down’)
     Move the current row up/down.

‘M-S-<UP>’ (‘org-table-kill-row’)
     Kill the current row or horizontal line.

‘M-S-<DOWN>’ (‘org-table-insert-row’)
     Insert a new row above the current row.  With a prefix argument,
     the line is created below the current one.

‘C-c -’ (‘org-table-insert-hline’)
     Insert a horizontal line below current row.  With a prefix
     argument, the line is created above the current line.

‘C-c <RET>’ (‘org-table-hline-and-move’)
     Insert a horizontal line below current row, and move the point into
     the row below that line.

‘C-c ^’ (‘org-table-sort-lines’)
     Sort the table lines in the region.  The position of point
     indicates the column to be used for sorting, and the range of lines
     is the range between the nearest horizontal separator lines, or the
     entire table.

4 Hyperlinks
************

Like HTML, Org provides links inside a file, external links to other
files, Usenet articles, emails, and much more.

   Org recognizes plain URIs, possibly wrapped within angle brackets,
and activate them as clickable links.  The general link format, however,
looks like this:

     [[LINK][DESCRIPTION]]

or alternatively

     [[LINK]]

   Once a link in the buffer is complete, with all brackets present, Org
changes the display so that ‘DESCRIPTION’ is displayed instead of
‘[[LINK][DESCRIPTION]]’ and ‘LINK’ is displayed instead of ‘[[LINK]]’.
To edit the invisible LINK part, use ‘C-c C-l’ with the point on the
link.

Internal links
==============

If the link does not look like a URL, it is considered to be internal in
the current file.  The most important case is a link like
‘[[#my-custom-id]]’ which links to the entry with the ‘CUSTOM_ID’
property ‘my-custom-id’.

   Links such as ‘[[My Target]]’ or ‘[[My Target][Find my target]]’ lead
to a text search in the current file for the corresponding target, which
looks like ‘<<My Target>>’.

External Links
==============

Org supports links to files, websites, Usenet and email messages, BBDB
database entries and links to both IRC conversations and their logs.
External links are URL-like locators.  They start with a short
identifying string followed by a colon.  There can be no space after the
colon.  Here are some examples:

‘http://www.astro.uva.nl/=dominik’          on the web
‘file:/home/dominik/images/jupiter.jpg’     file, absolute path
‘/home/dominik/images/jupiter.jpg’          same as above
‘file:papers/last.pdf’                      file, relative path
‘./papers/last.pdf’                         same as above
‘file:projects.org’                         another Org file
‘docview:papers/last.pdf::NNN’              open in DocView mode at page NNN
‘id:B7423F4D-2E8A-471B-8810-C40F074717E9’   link to heading by ID

‘info:org#Hyperlinks’                       Info node link

   File links can contain additional information to make Emacs jump to a
particular location in the file when following a link.  This can be a
line number or a search option after a double colon.  Here are a few
examples,, together with an explanation:

‘file:~/code/main.c::255’            Find line 255
‘file:~/xx.org::My Target’           Find ‘<<My Target>>’
‘[[file:~/xx.org::#my-custom-id]]’   Find entry with a custom ID

Handling Links
==============

Org provides methods to create a link in the correct syntax, to insert
it into an Org file, and to follow the link.

   The main function is ‘org-store-link’, called with ‘M-x
org-store-link’.  Because of its importance, we suggest to bind it to a
widely available key (see *note Activation::).  It stores a link to the
current location.  The link is stored for later insertion into an Org
buffer—see below.

   From an Org buffer, the following commands create, navigate or, more
generally, act on links.

‘C-c C-l’ (‘org-insert-link’)
     Insert a link.  This prompts for a link to be inserted into the
     buffer.  You can just type a link, or use history keys ‘<UP>’ and
     ‘<DOWN>’ to access stored links.  You will be prompted for the
     description part of the link.

     When called with a ‘C-u’ prefix argument, file name completion is
     used to link to a file.

‘C-c C-l’ (with point on existing link) (‘org-insert-link’)
     When point is on an existing link, ‘C-c C-l’ allows you to edit the
     link and description parts of the link.

‘C-c C-o’ (‘open-link-at-point’)
     Open link at point.

‘C-c &’ (‘org-mark-ring-goto’)
     Jump back to a recorded position.  A position is recorded by the
     commands following internal links, and by ‘C-c %’.  Using this
     command several times in direct succession moves through a ring of
     previously recorded positions.

5 TODO Items
************

Org mode does not require TODO lists to live in separate documents.
Instead, TODO items are part of a notes file, because TODO items usually
come up while taking notes!  With Org mode, simply mark any entry in a
tree as being a TODO item.  In this way, information is not duplicated,
and TODO items remain in the context from which they emerged.

   Org mode provides methods to give you an overview of all the things
that you have to do, collected from many files.

5.1 Basic TODO Functionality
============================

Any headline becomes a TODO item when it starts with the word ‘TODO’,
for example:

     *** TODO Write letter to Sam Fortune

   The most important commands to work with TODO entries are:

‘C-c C-t’ (‘org-todo’)
     Rotate the TODO state of the current item among

          ,-> (unmarked) -> TODO -> DONE --.
          '--------------------------------'

     The same rotation can also be done “remotely” from the agenda
     buffer with the ‘t’ command key (see *note Agenda Commands::).

‘S-<RIGHT>’ (‘org-shiftright’)
‘S-<LEFT>’ (‘org-shiftleft’)
     Select the following/preceding TODO state, similar to cycling.

‘C-c / t’ (‘org-show-todo-tree’)
     View TODO items in a _sparse tree_ (see *note Sparse Trees::).
     Folds the entire buffer, but shows all TODO items—with not-DONE
     state—and the headings hierarchy above them.

‘M-x org-agenda t’ (‘org-todo-list’)
     Show the global TODO list.  Collects the TODO items (with not-DONE
     states) from all agenda files (see *note Agenda Views::) into a
     single buffer.  See *note Global TODO List::, for more information.

‘S-M-<RET>’ (‘org-insert-todo-heading’)
     Insert a new TODO entry below the current one.

   Changing a TODO state can also trigger tag changes.  See the
docstring of the option ‘org-todo-state-tags-triggers’ for details.


File: orgguide.info,  Node: Multi-state Workflow,  Next: Progress Logging,  Prev: TODO Basics,  Up: TODO Items

5.2 Multi-state Workflow
========================

You can use TODO keywords to indicate _sequential_ working progress
states:

     (setq org-todo-keywords
           '((sequence "TODO" "FEEDBACK" "VERIFY" "|" "DONE" "DELEGATED")))

The vertical bar separates the ‘TODO’ keywords (states that _need
action_) from the ‘DONE’ states (which need _no further action_).  If
you do not provide the separator bar, the last state is used as the
‘DONE’ state.  With this setup, the command ‘C-c C-t’ cycles an entry
from ‘TODO’ to ‘FEEDBACK’, then to ‘VERIFY’, and finally to ‘DONE’ and
‘DELEGATED’.

   Sometimes you may want to use different sets of TODO keywords in
parallel.  For example, you may want to have the basic ‘TODO=/=DONE’,
but also a workflow for bug fixing.  Your setup would then look like
this:

     (setq org-todo-keywords
           '((sequence "TODO(t)" "|" "DONE(d)")
             (sequence "REPORT(r)" "BUG(b)" "KNOWNCAUSE(k)" "|" "FIXED(f)")))

The keywords should all be different, this helps Org mode to keep track
of which subsequence should be used for a given entry.  The example also
shows how to define keys for fast access of a particular state, by
adding a letter in parenthesis after each keyword—you will be prompted
for the key after ‘C-c C-t’.

   To define TODO keywords that are valid only in a single file, use the
following text anywhere in the file.

     #+TODO: TODO(t) | DONE(d)
     #+TODO: REPORT(r) BUG(b) KNOWNCAUSE(k) | FIXED(f)
     #+TODO: | CANCELED(c)

   After changing one of these lines, use ‘C-c C-c’ with the cursor
still in the line to make the changes known to Org mode.


File: orgguide.info,  Node: Progress Logging,  Next: Priorities,  Prev: Multi-state Workflow,  Up: TODO Items

5.3 Progress Logging
====================

To record a timestamp and a note when changing a TODO state, call the
command ‘org-todo’ with a prefix argument.

‘C-u C-c C-t’ (‘org-todo’)
     Prompt for a note and record a the time of the TODO state change.

   Org mode can also automatically record a timestamp and optionally a
note when you mark a TODO item as DONE, or even each time you change the
state of a TODO item.  This system is highly configurable, settings can
be on a per-keyword basis and can be localized to a file or even a
subtree.  For information on how to clock working time for a task, see
*note Clocking Work Time::.

Closing items
-------------

The most basic logging is to keep track of _when_ a certain TODO item
was marked as done.  This can be achieved with(1)

     (setq org-log-done 'time)

Then each time you turn an entry from a TODO (not-done) state into any
of the DONE states, a line ‘CLOSED: [timestamp]’ is inserted just after
the headline.

   If you want to record a note along with the timestamp, use(2)

     (setq org-log-done 'note)

You are then be prompted for a note, and that note is stored below the
entry with a ‘Closing Note’ heading.

Tracking TODO state changes
---------------------------

You might want to keep track of TODO state changes.  You can either
record just a timestamp, or a time-stamped note for a change.  These
records are inserted after the headline as an itemized list.  When
taking a lot of notes, you might want to get the notes out of the way
into a drawer.  Customize the variable ‘org-log-into-drawer’ to get this
behavior.

   For state logging, Org mode expects configuration on a per-keyword
basis.  This is achieved by adding special markers ‘!’ (for a timestamp)
and ‘@’ (for a note) in parentheses after each keyword.  For example:

     #+TODO: TODO(t) WAIT(w@/!) | DONE(d!) CANCELED(c@)

defines TODO keywords and fast access keys, and also request that a time
is recorded when the entry is set to ‘DONE’, and that a note is recorded
when switching to ‘WAIT’ or ‘CANCELED’.  The same syntax works also when
setting ‘org-todo-keywords’.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) The corresponding in-buffer setting is ‘#+STARTUP: logdone’.

   (2) The corresponding in-buffer setting is ‘#+STARTUP: logenotedone’.


File: orgguide.info,  Node: Priorities,  Next: Breaking Down Tasks,  Prev: Progress Logging,  Up: TODO Items

5.4 Priorities
==============

If you use Org mode extensively, you may end up with enough TODO items
that it starts to make sense to prioritize them.  Prioritizing can be
done by placing a _priority cookie_ into the headline of a TODO item,
like this

     *** TODO [#A] Write letter to Sam Fortune

   Org mode supports three priorities: ‘A’, ‘B’, and ‘C’.  ‘A’ is the
highest, ‘B’ the default if none is given.  Priorities make a difference
only in the agenda.

‘C-c ,’ (‘org-priority’)
     Set the priority of the current headline.  Press ‘A’, ‘B’ or ‘C’ to
     select a priority, or ‘<SPC>’ to remove the cookie.

‘S-<UP>’ (‘org-priority-up’)
‘S-<DOWN>’ (‘org-priority-down’)
     Increase/decrease the priority of the current headline.


File: orgguide.info,  Node: Breaking Down Tasks,  Next: Checkboxes,  Prev: Priorities,  Up: TODO Items

5.5 Breaking Tasks Down into Subtasks
=====================================

It is often advisable to break down large tasks into smaller, manageable
subtasks.  You can do this by creating an outline tree below a TODO
item, with detailed subtasks on the tree.  To keep an overview of the
fraction of subtasks that have already been marked as done, insert
either ‘[/]’ or ‘[%]’ anywhere in the headline.  These cookies are
updated each time the TODO status of a child changes, or when pressing
‘C-c C-c’ on the cookie.  For example:

     * Organize Party [33%]
     ** TODO Call people [1/2]
     *** TODO Peter
     *** DONE Sarah
     ** TODO Buy food
     ** DONE Talk to neighbor


File: orgguide.info,  Node: Checkboxes,  Prev: Breaking Down Tasks,  Up: TODO Items

5.6 Checkboxes
==============

Every item in a plain list (see *note Plain Lists::) can be made into a
checkbox by starting it with the string ‘[ ]’.  Checkboxes are not
included into the global TODO list, so they are often great to split a
task into a number of simple steps.

   Here is an example of a checkbox list.

     * TODO Organize party [2/4]
       - [-] call people [1/2]
         - [ ] Peter
         - [X] Sarah
       - [X] order food

   Checkboxes work hierarchically, so if a checkbox item has children
that are checkboxes, toggling one of the children checkboxes makes the
parent checkbox reflect if none, some, or all of the children are
checked.

   The following commands work with checkboxes:

‘C-c C-c’, ‘C-u C-c C-c’ (‘org-toggle-checkbox’)
     Toggle checkbox status or—with prefix argument—checkbox presence at
     point.

‘M-S-<RET>’ (‘org-insert-todo-heading’)
     Insert a new item with a checkbox.  This works only if point is
     already in a plain list item (see *note Plain Lists::).


File: orgguide.info,  Node: Tags,  Next: Properties,  Prev: TODO Items,  Up: Top

6 Tags
******

An excellent way to implement labels and contexts for cross-correlating
information is to assign _tags_ to headlines.  Org mode has extensive
support for tags.

   Every headline can contain a list of tags; they occur at the end of
the headline.  Tags are normal words containing letters, numbers, ‘_’,
and ‘@’.  Tags must be preceded and followed by a single colon, e.g.,
‘:work:’.  Several tags can be specified, as in ‘:work:urgent:’.  Tags
by default are in bold face with the same color as the headline.

Tag inheritance
===============

Tags make use of the hierarchical structure of outline trees.  If a
heading has a certain tag, all subheadings inherit the tag as well.  For
example, in the list

     * Meeting with the French group      :work:
     ** Summary by Frank                  :boss:notes:
     *** TODO Prepare slides for him      :action:

the final heading has the tags ‘work’, ‘boss’, ‘notes’, and ‘action’
even though the final heading is not explicitly marked with those tags.

   You can also set tags that all entries in a file should inherit just
as if these tags were defined in a hypothetical level zero that
surrounds the entire file.  Use a line like this(1):

     #+FILETAGS: :Peter:Boss:Secret:

Setting tags
============

Tags can simply be typed into the buffer at the end of a headline.
After a colon, ‘M-<TAB>’ offers completion on tags.  There is also a
special command for inserting tags:

‘C-c C-q’ (‘org-set-tags-command’)
     Enter new tags for the current headline.  Org mode either offers
     completion or a special single-key interface for setting tags, see
     below.

‘C-c C-c’ (‘org-set-tags-command’)
     When point is in a headline, this does the same as ‘C-c C-q’.

   Org supports tag insertion based on a _list of tags_.  By default
this list is constructed dynamically, containing all tags currently used
in the buffer.  You may also globally specify a hard list of tags with
the variable ‘org-tag-alist’.  Finally you can set the default tags for
a given file using the ‘TAGS’ keyword, like

     #+TAGS: @work @home @tennisclub
     #+TAGS: laptop car pc sailboat

   By default Org mode uses the standard minibuffer completion
facilities for entering tags.  However, it also implements another,
quicker, tag selection method called _fast tag selection_.  This allows
you to select and deselect tags with just a single key press.  For this
to work well you should assign unique letters to most of your commonly
used tags.  You can do this globally by configuring the variable
‘org-tag-alist’ in your Emacs init file.  For example, you may find the
need to tag many items in different files with ‘@home’.  In this case
you can set something like:

     (setq org-tag-alist '(("@work" . ?w) ("@home" . ?h) ("laptop" . ?l)))

   If the tag is only relevant to the file you are working on, then you
can instead set the ‘TAGS’ keyword as:

     #+TAGS: @work(w)  @home(h)  @tennisclub(t)  laptop(l)  pc(p)

Tag groups
==========

A tag can be defined as a _group tag_ for a set of other tags.  The
group tag can be seen as the “broader term” for its set of tags.

   You can set group tags by using brackets and inserting a colon
between the group tag and its related tags:

     #+TAGS: [ GTD : Control Persp ]

or, if tags in the group should be mutually exclusive:

     #+TAGS: { Context : @Home @Work }

   When you search for a group tag, it return matches for all members in
the group and its subgroups.  In an agenda view, filtering by a group
tag displays or hide headlines tagged with at least one of the members
of the group or any of its subgroups.

   If you want to ignore group tags temporarily, toggle group tags
support with ‘org-toggle-tags-groups’, bound to ‘C-c C-x q’.

Tag searches
============

‘C-c / m’ or ‘C-c \’ (‘org-match-sparse-tree’)
     Create a sparse tree with all headlines matching a tags search.
     With a ‘C-u’ prefix argument, ignore headlines that are not a TODO
     line.

‘M-x org-agenda m’ (‘org-tags-view’)
     Create a global list of tag matches from all agenda files.  See
     *note Matching Tags and Properties::.

‘M-x org-agenda M’ (‘org-tags-view’)
     Create a global list of tag matches from all agenda files, but
     check only TODO items.

   These commands all prompt for a match string which allows basic
Boolean logic like ‘+boss+urgent-project1’, to find entries with tags
‘boss’ and ‘urgent’, but not ‘project1’, or ‘Kathy|Sally’ to find
entries which are tagged, like ‘Kathy’ or ‘Sally’.  The full syntax of
the search string is rich and allows also matching against TODO
keywords, entry levels and properties.  For a more detailed description
with many examples, see *note Matching Tags and Properties::.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) As with all these in-buffer settings, pressing ‘C-c C-c’
activates any changes in the line.

7 Properties
************

Properties are key-value pairs associated with an entry.  They live in a
special drawer with the name ‘PROPERTIES’.  Each property is specified
on a single line, with the key (surrounded by colons) first, and the
value after it:

     * CD collection
     ** Classic
     *** Goldberg Variations
         :PROPERTIES:
         :Title:     Goldberg Variations
         :Composer:  J.S. Bach
         :Publisher: Deutsche Grammophon
         :NDisks:    1
         :END:

   You may define the allowed values for a particular property ‘Xyz’ by
setting a property ‘Xyz_ALL’.  This special property is _inherited_, so
if you set it in a level 1 entry, it applies to the entire tree.  When
allowed values are defined, setting the corresponding property becomes
easier and is less prone to typing errors.  For the example with the CD
collection, we can pre-define publishers and the number of disks in a
box like this:

     * CD collection
       :PROPERTIES:
       :NDisks_ALL:  1 2 3 4
       :Publisher_ALL: "Deutsche Grammophon" Philips EMI
       :END:

   If you want to set properties that can be inherited by any entry in a
file, use a line like:

     #+PROPERTY: NDisks_ALL 1 2 3 4

   The following commands help to work with properties:

‘C-c C-x p’ (‘org-set-property’)
     Set a property.  This prompts for a property name and a value.

‘C-c C-c d’ (‘org-delete-property’)
     Remove a property from the current entry.

   To create sparse trees and special lists with selection based on
properties, the same commands are used as for tag searches (see *note
Tags::).  The syntax for the search string is described in *note
Matching Tags and Properties::.

8 Dates and Times
*****************

To assist project planning, TODO items can be labeled with a date and/or
a time.  The specially formatted string carrying the date and time
information is called a _timestamp_ in Org mode.  This may be a little
confusing because timestamp is often used as indicating when something
was created or last changed.  However, in Org mode this term is used in
a much wider sense.

   Timestamps can be used to plan appointments, schedule tasks, set
deadlines, track time, and more.  The following sections describe the
timestamp format and tooling that Org mode provides for common use cases
dealing with time and time intervals.

* Menu:

* Timestamps::                   Assigning a time to a tree entry.

File: orgguide.info,  Node: Timestamps,  Next: Creating Timestamps,  Up: Dates and Times

8.1 Timestamps
==============

A timestamp is a specification of a date—possibly with a time or a range
of times—in a special format, either ‘<2003-09-16 Tue>’ or ‘<2003-09-16
Tue 09:39>’ or ‘<2003-09-16 Tue 12:00-12:30>’.  A timestamp can appear
anywhere in the headline or body of an Org tree entry.  Its presence
causes entries to be shown on specific dates in the agenda (see *note
Built-in Agenda Views::).  We distinguish:

Plain timestamp; Event; Appointment
     A simple timestamp just assigns a date/time to an item.  This is
     just like writing down an appointment or event in a paper agenda.
     There can be multiple timestamps in an item.

          * Meet Peter at the movies
            <2006-11-01 Wed 19:15>
          * Discussion on climate change
            <2006-11-02 Thu 20:00-22:00>
          * My days off
            <2006-11-03 Fri>
            <2006-11-06 Mon>

Timestamp with repeater interval
     A timestamp may contain a _repeater interval_, indicating that it
     applies not only on the given date, but again and again after a
     certain interval of N hours (h), days (d), weeks (w), months (m),
     or years (y).  The following shows up in the agenda every
     Wednesday:

          * Pick up Sam at school
            <2007-05-16 Wed 12:30 +1w>

Diary-style expression entries
     For more complex date specifications, Org mode supports using the
     special expression diary entries implemented in the Emacs Calendar
     package.  For example, with optional time:

          * 22:00-23:00 The nerd meeting on every 2nd Thursday of the month
            <%%(diary-float t 4 2)>

Time range
     Time range is a timestamp having two time units connected by ‘-’

          * Discussion on climate change
            <2006-11-02 Thu 10:00-12:00>

Time/Date range
     Two timestamps connected by ‘--’ denote a range.  In the agenda,
     the headline is shown on the first and last day of the range, and
     on any dates that are displayed and fall in the range.  The first
     example specifies just the dates of the range while the second
     example specifies a time range for each date.

          ** Meeting in Amsterdam
             <2004-08-23 Mon>--<2004-08-26 Thu>
          ** This weeks committee meetings
             <2004-08-23 Mon 10:00-11:00>--<2004-08-26 Thu 10:00-11:00>

Inactive timestamp
     Just like a plain timestamp, but with square brackets instead of
     angular ones.  These timestamps are inactive in the sense that they
     do _not_ trigger an entry to show up in the agenda.

          * Gillian comes late for the fifth time
            [2006-11-01 Wed]


File: orgguide.info,  Node: Creating Timestamps,  Next: Deadlines and Scheduling,  Prev: Timestamps,  Up: Dates and Times

8.2 Creating Timestamps
=======================

For Org mode to recognize timestamps, they need to be in the specific
format.  All commands listed below produce timestamps in the correct
format.

‘C-c .’ (‘org-timestamp’)
     Prompt for a date and insert a corresponding timestamp.  When point
     is at an existing timestamp in the buffer, the command is used to
     modify this timestamp instead of inserting a new one.  When this
     command is used twice in succession, a time range is inserted.
     With a prefix argument, it also adds the current time.

‘C-c !’ (‘org-timestamp-inactive’)
     Like ‘C-c .’, but insert an inactive timestamp that does not cause
     an agenda entry.

‘S-<LEFT>’ (‘org-timestamp-down-day’)
‘S-<RIGHT>’ (‘org-timestamp-up-day’)
     Change date at point by one day.

‘S-<UP>’ (‘org-timestamp-up’)
‘S-<DOWN>’ (‘org-timestamp-down’)
     On the beginning or enclosing bracket of a timestamp, change its
     type.  Within a timestamp, change the item under point.  Point can
     be on a year, month, day, hour or minute.  When the timestamp
     contains a time range like ‘15:30-16:30’, modifying the first time
     also shifts the second, shifting the time block with constant
     length.  To change the length, modify the second time.

   When Org mode prompts for a date/time, it accepts any string
containing some date and/or time information, and intelligently
interprets the string, deriving defaults for unspecified information
from the current date and time.  You can also select a date in the
pop-up calendar.  See the *note manual: (org)Top. for more information
on how exactly the date/time prompt works.


File: orgguide.info,  Node: Deadlines and Scheduling,  Next: Clocking Work Time,  Prev: Creating Timestamps,  Up: Dates and Times

8.3 Deadlines and Scheduling
============================

A timestamp may be preceded by special keywords to facilitate planning:

‘C-c C-d’ (‘org-deadline’)
     Insert ‘DEADLINE’ keyword along with a time stamp, in the line
     following the headline.

     Meaning: the task—most likely a TODO item, though not
     necessarily—is supposed to be finished on that date.

     On the deadline date, the task is listed in the agenda.  In
     addition, the agenda for _today_ carries a warning about the
     approaching or missed deadline, starting
     ‘org-deadline-warning-days’ before the due date, and continuing
     until the entry is marked as done.  An example:

          *** TODO write article about the Earth for the Guide
              DEADLINE: <2004-02-29 Sun>
              The editor in charge is [[bbdb:Ford Prefect]]

‘C-c C-s’ (‘org-schedule’)
     Insert ‘SCHEDULED’ keyword along with a stamp, in the line
     following the headline.

     Meaning: you are planning to start working on that task on the
     given date(1).

     The headline is listed under the given date(2).  In addition, a
     reminder that the scheduled date has passed is present in the
     compilation for _today_, until the entry is marked as done, i.e.,
     the task is automatically forwarded until completed.

          *** TODO Call Trillian for a date on New Years Eve.
              SCHEDULED: <2004-12-25 Sat>

   Some tasks need to be repeated again and again.  Org mode helps to
organize such tasks using a so-called repeater in a ‘DEADLINE’,
‘SCHEDULED’, or plain timestamps.  In the following example:

     ** TODO Pay the rent
        DEADLINE: <2005-10-01 Sat +1m>

the ‘+1m’ is a repeater; the intended interpretation is that the task
has a deadline on ‘<2005-10-01>’ and repeats itself every (one) month
starting from that time.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) This is quite different from what is normally understood by
_scheduling a meeting_, which is done in Org by just inserting a time
stamp without keyword.

   (2) It will still be listed on that date after it has been marked as
done.  If you do not like this, set the variable
‘org-agenda-skip-scheduled-if-done’.

8.4 Clocking Work Time
======================

Org mode allows you to clock the time you spend on specific tasks in a
project.

‘C-c C-x C-i’ (‘org-clock-in’)
     Start the clock on the current item (clock-in).  This inserts the
     ‘CLOCK’ keyword together with a timestamp.  When called with a
     ‘C-u’ prefix argument, select the task from a list of recently
     clocked tasks.

‘C-c C-x C-o’ (‘org-clock-out’)
     Stop the clock (clock-out).  This inserts another timestamp at the
     same location where the clock was last started.  It also directly
     computes the resulting time in inserts it after the time range as
     ‘=>HH:MM’.

‘C-c C-x C-e’ (‘org-clock-modify-effort-estimate’)
     Update the effort estimate for the current clock task.

‘C-c C-x C-q’ (‘org-clock-cancel’)
     Cancel the current clock.  This is useful if a clock was started by
     mistake, or if you ended up working on something else.

‘C-c C-x C-j’ (‘org-clock-goto’)
     Jump to the headline of the currently clocked in task.  With a
     ‘C-u’ prefix argument, select the target task from a list of
     recently clocked tasks.

   The ‘l’ key may be used in the agenda (see *note Built-in Agenda
Views::) to show which tasks have been worked on or closed during a day.

9 Capture, Refile, Archive
**************************

An important part of any organization system is the ability to quickly
capture new ideas and tasks, and to associate reference material with
them.  Org does this using a process called _capture_.  It also can
store files related to a task (_attachments_) in a special directory.
Once in the system, tasks and projects need to be moved around.  Moving
completed project trees to an archive file keeps the system compact and
fast.

* Menu:

* Capture::                      Capturing new stuff.
* Refile and Copy::              Moving/copying a tree from one place to another.
* Archiving::                    What to do with finished products.


File: orgguide.info,  Node: Capture,  Next: Refile and Copy,  Up: Capture Refile Archive

9.1 Capture
===========

Capture lets you quickly store notes with little interruption of your
work flow.  You can define templates for new entries and associate them
with different targets for storing notes.

Setting up capture
------------------

The following customization sets a default target(1) file for notes.

     (setq org-default-notes-file (concat org-directory "/notes.org"))

   You may also define a global key for capturing new material (see
*note Activation::).

Using capture
-------------

‘M-x org-capture’ (‘org-capture’)
     Start a capture process, placing you into a narrowed indirect
     buffer to edit.

‘C-c C-c’ (‘org-capture-finalize’)
     Once you have finished entering information into the capture
     buffer, ‘C-c C-c’ returns you to the window configuration before
     the capture process, so that you can resume your work without
     further distraction.

‘C-c C-w’ (‘org-capture-refile’)
     Finalize the capture process by refiling the note to a different
     place (see *note Refile and Copy::).

‘C-c C-k’ (‘org-capture-kill’)
     Abort the capture process and return to the previous state.

Capture templates
-----------------

You can use templates for different types of capture items, and for
different target locations.  Say you would like to use one template to
create general TODO entries, and you want to put these entries under the
heading ‘Tasks’ in your file ‘~/org/gtd.org’.  Also, a date tree in the
file ‘journal.org’ should capture journal entries.  A possible
configuration would look like:

     (setq org-capture-templates
           '(("t" "Todo" entry (file+headline "~/org/gtd.org" "Tasks")
              "* TODO %?\n  %i\n  %a")
             ("j" "Journal" entry (file+datetree "~/org/journal.org")
              "* %?\nEntered on %U\n  %i\n  %a")))

   If you then press ‘t’ from the capture menu, Org will prepare the
template for you like this:

     * TODO
       [[file:LINK TO WHERE YOU INITIATED CAPTURE]]

During expansion of the template, special %-escapes(2) allow dynamic
insertion of content.  Here is a small selection of the possibilities,
consult the *note manual: (org)Top. for more.

‘%a’         annotation, normally the link created with ‘org-store-link’
‘%i’         initial content, the region when capture is called with ‘C-u’
‘%t’, ‘%T’   timestamp, date only, or date and time
‘%u’, ‘%U’   like above, but inactive timestamps
‘%?’         after completing the template, position point here

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) Using capture templates, you get finer control over capture
locations.  See *note Capture templates::.

   (2) If you need one of these sequences literally, escape the ‘%’ with
a backslash.

9.2 Refile and Copy
===================

When reviewing the captured data, you may want to refile or to copy some
of the entries into a different list, for example into a project.
Cutting, finding the right location, and then pasting the note is
cumbersome.  To simplify this process, you can use the following special
command:

‘C-c C-w’ (‘org-agenda-refile’)
     Refile the entry or region at point.  This command offers possible
     locations for refiling the entry and lets you select one with
     completion.  The item (or all items in the region) is filed below
     the target heading as a subitem.

     By default, all level 1 headlines in the current buffer are
     considered to be targets, but you can have more complex definitions
     across a number of files.  See the variable ‘org-refile-targets’
     for details.

‘C-u C-c C-w’ (‘org-agenda-refile’)
     Use the refile interface to jump to a heading.

‘C-u C-u C-c C-w’ (‘org-refile-goto-last-stored’)
     Jump to the location where ‘org-refile’ last moved a tree to.

‘C-c M-w’ (‘org-refile-copy’)
     Copying works like refiling, except that the original note is not
     deleted.


File: orgguide.info,  Node: Archiving,  Prev: Refile and Copy,  Up: Capture Refile Archive

9.3 Archiving
=============

When a project represented by a (sub)tree is finished, you may want to
move the tree out of the way and to stop it from contributing to the
agenda.  Archiving is important to keep your working files compact and
global searches like the construction of agenda views fast.

   The most common archiving action is to move a project tree to another
file, the archive file.

‘C-c C-x C-a’ (‘org-archive-subtree-default’)
     Archive the current entry using the command specified in the
     variable ‘org-archive-default-command’.

‘C-c C-x C-s’ or short ‘C-c $’ (‘org-archive-subtree’)
     Archive the subtree starting at point position to the location
     given by ‘org-archive-location’.

   The default archive location is a file in the same directory as the
current file, with the name derived by appending ‘_archive’ to the
current file name.  You can also choose what heading to file archived
items under, with the possibility to add them to a datetree in a file.
For information and examples on how to specify the file and the heading,
see the documentation string of the variable ‘org-archive-location’.

   There is also an in-buffer option for setting this variable, for
example:

     #+ARCHIVE: %s_done::

10 Agenda Views
***************

Due to the way Org works, TODO items, time-stamped items, and tagged
headlines can be scattered throughout a file or even a number of files.
To get an overview of open action items, or of events that are important
for a particular date, this information must be collected, sorted and
displayed in an organized way.

   The extracted information is displayed in a special _agenda buffer_.
This buffer is read-only, but provides commands to visit the
corresponding locations in the original Org files, and even to edit
these files remotely.  Remote editing from the agenda buffer means, for
example, that you can change the dates of deadlines and appointments
from the agenda buffer.  For commands available in the Agenda buffer,
see *note Agenda Commands::.

* Menu:

* Agenda Files::                 Files being searched for agenda information.
* Agenda Dispatcher::            Keyboard access to agenda views.
* Built-in Agenda Views::        What is available out of the box?

File: orgguide.info,  Node: Agenda Files,  Next: Agenda Dispatcher,  Up: Agenda Views

10.1 Agenda Files
=================

The information to be shown is normally collected from all _agenda
files_, the files listed in the variable ‘org-agenda-files’.

‘C-c [’ (‘org-agenda-file-to-front’)
     Add current file to the list of agenda files.  The file is added to
     the front of the list.  If it was already in the list, it is moved
     to the front.  With a prefix argument, file is added/moved to the
     end.

‘C-c ]’ (‘org-remove-file’)
     Remove current file from the list of agenda files.

‘C-'’
‘C-,’ (‘org-cycle-agenda-files’)
     Cycle through agenda file list, visiting one file after the other.


File: orgguide.info,  Node: Agenda Dispatcher,  Next: Built-in Agenda Views,  Prev: Agenda Files,  Up: Agenda Views

10.2 The Agenda Dispatcher
==========================

The views are created through a dispatcher, accessible with ‘M-x
org-agenda’, or, better, bound to a global key (see *note Activation::).
It displays a menu from which an additional letter is required to
execute a command.  The dispatcher offers the following default
commands:

‘a’
     Create the calendar-like agenda (see *note Built-in Agenda
     Views::).

‘t’
‘T’
     Create a list of all TODO items (see *note Global TODO List::).

‘m’
‘M’
     Create a list of headlines matching a given expression (see *note
     Matching Tags and Properties::).

‘s’
     Create a list of entries selected by a boolean expression of
     keywords and/or regular expressions that must or must not occur in
     the entry.


File: orgguide.info,  Node: Built-in Agenda Views,  Next: Global TODO List,  Prev: Agenda Dispatcher,  Up: Agenda Views

10.3 The Weekly/Daily Agenda
============================

The purpose of the weekly/daily _agenda_ is to act like a page of a
paper agenda, showing all the tasks for the current week or day.

‘M-x org-agenda a’ (‘org-agenda-list’)
     Compile an agenda for the current week from a list of Org files.
     The agenda shows the entries for each day.

   Org mode understands the syntax of the diary and allows you to use
diary expression entries directly in Org files:

     * Holidays
       :PROPERTIES:
       :CATEGORY: Holiday
       :END:
     %%(org-calendar-holiday)   ; special function for holiday names

     * Birthdays
       :PROPERTIES:
       :CATEGORY: Ann
       :END:
     %%(org-anniversary 1956  5 14) Arthur Dent is %d years old
     %%(org-anniversary 1869 10  2) Mahatma Gandhi would be %d years old

   Org can interact with Emacs appointments notification facility.  To
add the appointments of your agenda files, use the command
‘org-agenda-to-appt’.


File: orgguide.info,  Node: Global TODO List,  Next: Matching Tags and Properties,  Prev: Built-in Agenda Views,  Up: Agenda Views

10.4 The Global TODO List
=========================

The global TODO list contains all unfinished TODO items formatted and
collected into a single place.  Remote editing of TODO items lets you
can change the state of a TODO entry with a single key press.  For
commands available in the TODO list, see *note Agenda Commands::.

‘M-x org-agenda t’ (‘org-todo-list’)
     Show the global TODO list.  This collects the TODO items from all
     agenda files (see *note Agenda Views::) into a single buffer.

‘M-x org-agenda T’ (‘org-todo-list’)
     Like the above, but allows selection of a specific TODO keyword.


File: orgguide.info,  Node: Matching Tags and Properties,  Next: Search View,  Prev: Global TODO List,  Up: Agenda Views

10.5 Matching Tags and Properties
=================================

If headlines in the agenda files are marked with _tags_ (see *note
Tags::), or have properties (see *note Properties::), you can select
headlines based on this metadata and collect them into an agenda buffer.
The match syntax described here also applies when creating sparse trees
with ‘C-c / m’.

‘M-x org-agenda m’ (‘org-tags-view’)
     Produce a list of all headlines that match a given set of tags.
     The command prompts for a selection criterion, which is a boolean
     logic expression with tags, like ‘+work+urgent-withboss’ or
     ‘work|home’ (see *note Tags::).  If you often need a specific
     search, define a custom command for it (see *note Agenda
     Dispatcher::).

‘M-x org-agenda M’ (‘org-tags-view’)
     Like ‘m’, but only select headlines that are also TODO items.

   A search string can use Boolean operators ‘&’ for AND and ‘|’ for OR.
‘&’ binds more strongly than ‘|’.  Parentheses are currently not
implemented.  Each element in the search is either a tag, a regular
expression matching tags, or an expression like ‘PROPERTY OPERATOR
VALUE’ with a comparison operator, accessing a property value.  Each
element may be preceded by ‘-’ to select against it, and ‘+’ is
syntactic sugar for positive selection.  The AND operator ‘&’ is
optional when ‘+’ or ‘-’ is present.  Here are some examples, using only
tags.

‘+work-boss’
     Select headlines tagged ‘work’, but discard those also tagged
     ‘boss’.

‘work|laptop’
     Selects lines tagged ‘work’ or ‘laptop’.

‘work|laptop+night’
     Like before, but require the ‘laptop’ lines to be tagged also
     ‘night’.

   You may also test for properties at the same time as matching tags,
see the *note manual: (org)Top. for more information.


File: orgguide.info,  Node: Search View,  Next: Agenda Commands,  Prev: Matching Tags and Properties,  Up: Agenda Views

10.6 Search View
================

This agenda view is a general text search facility for Org mode entries.
It is particularly useful to find notes.

‘M-x org-agenda s’ (‘org-search-view’)
     This is a special search that lets you select entries by matching a
     substring or specific words using a boolean logic.

   For example, the search string ‘computer equipment’ matches entries
that contain ‘computer equipment’ as a substring.

   Search view can also search for specific keywords in the entry, using
Boolean logic.  The search string ‘+computer +wifi -ethernet
-{8\.11[bg]}’ matches note entries that contain the keywords ‘computer’
and ‘wifi’, but not the keyword ‘ethernet’, and which are also not
matched by the regular expression ‘8\.11[bg]’, meaning to exclude both
‘8.11b’ and ‘8.11g’.

   Note that in addition to the agenda files, this command also searches
the files listed in ‘org-agenda-text-search-extra-files’.

10.7 Commands in the Agenda Buffer
==================================

Entries in the agenda buffer are linked back to the Org file or diary
file where they originate.  You are not allowed to edit the agenda
buffer itself, but commands are provided to show and jump to the
original entry location, and to edit the Org files “remotely” from the
agenda buffer.  This is just a selection of the many commands, explore
the agenda menu and the *note manual: (org)Top. for a complete list.

‘x’ (‘org-agenda-exit’)
     Exit agenda, remove the agenda buffer and all buffers loaded by
     Emacs for the compilation of the agenda.


File: orgguide.info,  Node: Custom Agenda Views,  Prev: Agenda Commands,  Up: Agenda Views

10.8 Custom Agenda Views
========================

The first application of custom searches is the definition of keyboard
shortcuts for frequently used searches, either creating an agenda
buffer, or a sparse tree (the latter covering of course only the current
buffer).

   Custom commands are configured in the variable
‘org-agenda-custom-commands’.  You can customize this variable, for
example by pressing ‘C’ from the agenda dispatcher (see *note Agenda
Dispatcher::).  You can also directly set it with Emacs Lisp in the
Emacs init file.  The following example contains all valid agenda views:

     (setq org-agenda-custom-commands
           '(("w" todo "WAITING")
             ("u" tags "+boss-urgent")
             ("v" tags-todo "+boss-urgent")))

   The initial string in each entry defines the keys you have to press
after the dispatcher command in order to access the command.  Usually
this is just a single character.  The second parameter is the search
type, followed by the string or regular expression to be used for the
matching.  The example above will therefore define:

‘w’
     as a global search for TODO entries with ‘WAITING’ as the TODO
     keyword.

‘u’
     as a global tags search for headlines tagged ‘boss’ but not
     ‘urgent’.

‘v’
     The same search, but limiting it to headlines that are also TODO
     items.

11 Markup for Rich Contents
***************************

Org is primarily about organizing and searching through your plain-text
notes.  However, it also provides a lightweight yet robust markup
language for rich text formatting and more.  Used in conjunction with
the export framework (see *note Exporting::), you can author beautiful
documents in Org.

* Menu:

* Paragraphs::                   The basic unit of text.
* Emphasis and Monospace::       Bold, italic, etc.
* Embedded LaTeX::            LaTeX can be freely used inside Org documents.
* Literal examples::             Source code examples with special formatting.
* Images::                       Display an image.
* Creating Footnotes::           Edit and read footnotes.


File: orgguide.info,  Node: Paragraphs,  Next: Emphasis and Monospace,  Up: Markup

11.1 Paragraphs
===============

Paragraphs are separated by at least one empty line.  If you need to
enforce a line break within a paragraph, use ‘\\’ at the end of a line.

   To preserve the line breaks, indentation and blank lines in a region,
but otherwise use normal formatting, you can use this construct, which
can also be used to format poetry.

     #+BEGIN_VERSE
      Great clouds overhead
      Tiny black birds rise and fall
      Snow covers Emacs

         ---AlexSchroeder
     #+END_VERSE

   When quoting a passage from another document, it is customary to
format this as a paragraph that is indented on both the left and the
right margin.  You can include quotations in Org documents like this:

     #+BEGIN_QUOTE
     Everything should be made as simple as possible,
     but not any simpler ---Albert Einstein
     #+END_QUOTE

   If you would like to center some text, do it like this:

     #+BEGIN_CENTER
     Everything should be made as simple as possible, \\
     but not any simpler
     #+END_CENTER

11.2 Emphasis and Monospace
===========================

You can make words ‘*bold*’, ‘/italic/’, ‘_underlined_’, ‘=verbatim=’
and ‘~code~’, and, if you must, ‘+strike-through+’.  Text in the code
and verbatim string is not processed for Org specific syntax; it is
exported verbatim.

11.3 Embedded LaTeX
===================

For scientific notes which need to be able to contain mathematical
symbols and the occasional formula, Org mode supports embedding LaTeX
code into its files.  You can directly use TeX-like syntax for special
symbols, enter formulas and entire LaTeX environments.

     The radius of the sun is R_sun = 6.96 x 10^8 m.  On the other hand,
     the radius of Alpha Centauri is R_{Alpha Centauri} = 1.28 x R_{sun}.

     \end{equation}                          % etc

     If $a^2=b$ and \( b=2 \), then the solution must be
     either $$ a=+\sqrt{2} $$ or \[ a=-\sqrt{2} \].

11.4 Literal examples
=====================

You can include literal examples that should not be subjected to markup.
Such examples are typeset in monospace, so this is well suited for
source code and similar examples.

     #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
       Some example from a text file.
     #+END_EXAMPLE

   For simplicity when using small examples, you can also start the
example lines with a colon followed by a space.  There may also be
additional whitespace before the colon:

     Here is an example
        : Some example from a text file.

   If the example is source code from a programming language, or any
other text that can be marked up by Font Lock in Emacs, you can ask for
the example to look like the fontified Emacs buffer.

     #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
       (defun org-xor (a b)
         "Exclusive or."
         (if a (not b) b))
      #+END_SRC

   To edit the example in a special buffer supporting this language, use
‘C-c '’ to both enter and leave the editing buffer.

11.5 Images
===========

An image is a link to an image file that does not have a description
part, for example

     ./img/cat.jpg

   If you wish to define a caption for the image and maybe a label for
internal cross references (see *note Hyperlinks::), make sure that the
link is on a line by itself and precede it with ‘CAPTION’ and ‘NAME’
keywords as follows:

     #+CAPTION: This is the caption for the next figure link (or table)
     #+NAME:   fig:SED-HR4049
     [[./img/a.jpg]]


File: orgguide.info,  Node: Creating Footnotes,  Prev: Images,  Up: Markup

11.6 Creating Footnotes
=======================

A footnote is defined in a paragraph that is started by a footnote
marker in square brackets in column 0, no indentation allowed.  The
footnote reference is simply the marker in square brackets, inside text.
For example:

     The Org website[fn:1] now looks a lot better than it used to.
     ...
     [fn:1] The link is: https://orgmode.org

   The following commands handle footnotes:

‘C-c C-x f’ (‘org-footnote-action’)
     The footnote action command.  When point is on a footnote
     reference, jump to the definition.  When it is at a definition,
     jump to the (first) reference.  Otherwise, create a new footnote.
     When this command is called with a prefix argument, a menu of
     additional options including renumbering is offered.

‘C-c C-c’ (‘org-ctrl-c-ctrl-c’)
     Jump between definition and reference.

12 Exporting
************

Org can convert and export documents to a variety of other formats while
retaining as much structure (see *note Document Structure::) and markup
(see *note Markup::) as possible.

* Menu:

* The Export Dispatcher::        The main interface.
* Export Settings::              Common export settings.
* Table of Contents::            The if and where of the table of contents.
* Include Files::                Include additional files into a document.
* Comment Lines::                What will not be exported.
* ASCII/UTF-8 Export::           Exporting to flat files with encoding.
* HTML Export::                  Exporting to HTML.
* LaTeX Export::              Exporting to LaTeX and processing to PDF.
* iCalendar Export::             Exporting to iCalendar.


File: orgguide.info,  Node: The Export Dispatcher,  Next: Export Settings,  Up: Exporting

12.1 The Export Dispatcher
==========================

The export dispatcher is the main interface for Org’s exports.  A
hierarchical menu presents the currently configured export formats.
Options are shown as easy toggle switches on the same screen.

‘C-c C-e’ (‘org-export-dispatch’)
     Invokes the export dispatcher interface.

   Org exports the entire buffer by default.  If the Org buffer has an
active region, then Org exports just that region.


File: orgguide.info,  Node: Export Settings,  Next: Table of Contents,  Prev: The Export Dispatcher,  Up: Exporting

12.2 Export Settings
====================

The exporter recognizes special lines in the buffer which provide
additional information.  These lines may be put anywhere in the file:

     #+TITLE: I'm in the Mood for Org

   Most proeminent export options include:

‘TITLE’      the title to be shown
‘AUTHOR’     the author (default taken from ‘user-full-name’)
‘DATE’       a date, fixed, or an Org timestamp
‘EMAIL’      email address (default from ‘user-mail-address’)
‘LANGUAGE’   language code, e.g., ‘en’

   Option keyword sets can be inserted from the export dispatcher (see
*note The Export Dispatcher::) using the ‘Insert template’ command by
pressing ‘#’.


File: orgguide.info,  Node: Table of Contents,  Next: Include Files,  Prev: Export Settings,  Up: Exporting

12.3 Table of Contents
======================

The table of contents includes all headlines in the document.  Its depth
is therefore the same as the headline levels in the file.  If you need
to use a different depth, or turn it off entirely, set the
‘org-export-with-toc’ variable accordingly.  You can achieve the same on
a per file basis, using the following ‘toc’ item in ‘OPTIONS’ keyword:

     #+OPTIONS: toc:2          (only include two levels in TOC)
     #+OPTIONS: toc:nil        (no default TOC at all)

   Org normally inserts the table of contents directly before the first
headline of the file.


File: orgguide.info,  Node: Include Files,  Next: Comment Lines,  Prev: Table of Contents,  Up: Exporting

12.4 Include Files
==================

During export, you can include the content of another file.  For
example, to include your ‘.emacs’ file, you could use:

     #+INCLUDE: "~/.emacs" src emacs-lisp

The first parameter is the file name to include.  The optional second
parameter specifies the block type: ‘example’, ‘export’ or ‘src’.  The
optional third parameter specifies the source code language to use for
formatting the contents.  This is relevant to both ‘export’ and ‘src’
block types.

   You can visit the included file with ‘C-c '’.


File: orgguide.info,  Node: Comment Lines,  Next: ASCII/UTF-8 Export,  Prev: Include Files,  Up: Exporting

12.5 Comment Lines
==================

Lines starting with zero or more whitespace characters followed by one
‘#’ and a whitespace are treated as comments and, as such, are not
exported.

   Likewise, regions surrounded by ‘#+BEGIN_COMMENT’ ... ‘#+END_COMMENT’
are not exported.

   Finally, a ‘COMMENT’ keyword at the beginning of an entry, but after
any other keyword or priority cookie, comments out the entire subtree.
The command below helps changing the comment status of a headline.

‘C-c ;’ (‘org-toggle-comment’)
     Toggle the ‘COMMENT’ keyword at the beginning of an entry.


File: orgguide.info,  Node: ASCII/UTF-8 Export,  Next: HTML Export,  Prev: Comment Lines,  Up: Exporting

12.6 ASCII/UTF-8 Export
=======================

ASCII export produces an output file containing only plain ASCII
characters.  This is the simplest and most direct text output.  It does
not contain any Org markup.  UTF-8 export uses additional characters and
symbols available in this encoding standards.

‘C-c C-e t a’
‘C-c C-e t u’ (‘org-ascii-export-to-ascii’)
     Export as an ASCII file with a ‘.txt’ extension.  For ‘myfile.org’,
     Org exports to ‘myfile.txt’, overwriting without warning.  For
     ‘myfile.txt’, Org exports to ‘myfile.txt.txt’ in order to prevent
     data loss.


File: orgguide.info,  Node: HTML Export,  Next: LaTeX Export,  Prev: ASCII/UTF-8 Export,  Up: Exporting

12.7 HTML Export
================

Org mode contains an HTML exporter with extensive HTML formatting
compatible with XHTML 1.0 strict standard.

‘C-c C-e h h’ (‘org-html-export-to-html’)
     Export as HTML file with a ‘.html’ extension.  For ‘myfile.org’,
     Org exports to ‘myfile.html’, overwriting without warning.  ‘C-c
     C-e h o’ exports to HTML and opens it in a web browser.

   The HTML export backend transforms ‘<’ and ‘>’ to ‘&lt;’ and ‘&gt;’.
To include raw HTML code in the Org file so the HTML export backend can
insert that HTML code in the output, use this inline syntax:
‘@@html:...@@’.  For example:

     @@html:<b>@@bold text@@html:</b>@@

   For larger raw HTML code blocks, use these HTML export code blocks:

     #+HTML: Literal HTML code for export

     #+BEGIN_EXPORT html
       All lines between these markers are exported literally
     #+END_EXPORT


File: orgguide.info,  Node: LaTeX Export,  Next: iCalendar Export,  Prev: HTML Export,  Up: Exporting

12.8 LaTeX Export
=================

The LaTeX export backend can handle complex documents, incorporate
standard or custom LaTeX document classes, generate documents using
alternate LaTeX engines, and produce fully linked PDF files with
indexes, bibliographies, and tables of contents, destined for
interactive online viewing or high-quality print publication.

   By default, the LaTeX output uses the _article_ class.  You can
change this by adding an option like ‘#+LATEX_CLASS: myclass’ in your
file.  The class must be listed in ‘org-latex-classes’.

‘C-c C-e l l’ (‘org-latex-export-to-latex’)
     Export to a LaTeX file with a ‘.tex’ extension.  For ‘myfile.org’,
     Org exports to ‘myfile.tex’, overwriting without warning.

‘C-c C-e l p’ (‘org-latex-export-to-pdf’)
     Export as LaTeX file and convert it to PDF file.

‘C-c C-e l o’ (‘<no corresponding named command>’)
     Export as LaTeX file and convert it to PDF, then open the PDF using
     the default viewer.

   The LaTeX export backend can insert any arbitrary LaTeX code, see
*note Embedded LaTeX::.  There are three ways to embed such code in the
Org file and they all use different quoting syntax.

   Inserting in-line quoted with @ symbols:

     Code embedded in-line @@latex:any arbitrary LaTeX code@@ in a paragraph.

   Inserting as one or more keyword lines in the Org file:

     #+LATEX: any arbitrary LaTeX code

   Inserting as an export block in the Org file, where the backend
exports any code between begin and end markers:

     #+BEGIN_EXPORT latex
       any arbitrary LaTeX code
     #+END_EXPORT


File: orgguide.info,  Node: iCalendar Export,  Prev: LaTeX Export,  Up: Exporting

12.9 iCalendar Export
=====================

A large part of Org mode’s interoperability success is its ability to
easily export to or import from external applications.  The iCalendar
export backend takes calendar data from Org files and exports to the
standard iCalendar format.

‘C-c C-e c f’ (‘org-icalendar-export-to-ics’)
     Create iCalendar entries from the current Org buffer and store them
     in the same directory, using a file extension ‘.ics’.

‘C-c C-e c c’ (‘org-icalendar-combine-agenda-files’)
     Create a combined iCalendar file from Org files in
     ‘org-agenda-files’ and write it to
     ‘org-icalendar-combined-agenda-file’ file name.

13 Publishing
*************

Org includes a publishing management system that allows you to configure
automatic HTML conversion of _projects_ composed of interlinked Org
files.  You can also configure Org to automatically upload your exported
HTML pages and related attachments, such as images and source code
files, to a web server.

   You can also use Org to convert files into PDF, or even combine HTML
and PDF conversion so that files are available in both formats on the
server.

   For detailed instructions about setup, see the *note manual:
(org)Top.  Here is an example:

     (setq org-publish-project-alist
           '(("org"
              :base-directory "~/org/"
              :publishing-function org-html-publish-to-html
              :publishing-directory "~/public_html"
              :section-numbers nil
              :with-toc nil
              :html-head "<link rel=\"stylesheet\"
                         href=\"../other/mystyle.css\"
                         type=\"text/css\"/>")))

‘C-c C-e P x’ (‘org-publish’)
     Prompt for a specific project and publish all files that belong to
     it.

‘C-c C-e P p’ (‘org-publish-current-project’)
     Publish the project containing the current file.

‘C-c C-e P f’ (‘org-publish-current-file’)
     Publish only the current file.

‘C-c C-e P a’ (‘org-publish-all’)
     Publish every project.

   Org uses timestamps to track when a file has changed.  The above
functions normally only publish changed files.  You can override this
and force publishing of all files by giving a prefix argument to any of
the commands above.

14 Working with Source Code
***************************

Org mode provides a number of features for working with source code,
including editing of code blocks in their native major mode, evaluation
of code blocks, tangling of code blocks, and exporting code blocks and
their results in several formats.

   A source code block conforms to this structure:

     #+NAME: <name>
     #+BEGIN_SRC <language> <switches> <header arguments>
       <body>
     #+END_SRC

where:

   • ‘<name>’ is a string used to uniquely name the code block,

   • ‘<language>’ specifies the language of the code block, e.g.,
     ‘emacs-lisp’, ‘shell’, ‘R’, ‘python’, etc.,

   • ‘<switches>’ can be used to control export of the code block,

   • ‘<header arguments>’ can be used to control many aspects of code
     block behavior as demonstrated below,

   • ‘<body>’ contains the actual source code.

   Use ‘C-c '’ to edit the current code block.  It opens a new major
mode edit buffer containing the body of the source code block, ready for
any edits.  Use ‘C-c '’ again to close the buffer and return to the Org
buffer.

Using header arguments
======================

A header argument is specified with an initial colon followed by the
argument’s name in lowercase.

   Header arguments can be set in several ways; Org prioritizes them in
case of overlaps or conflicts by giving local settings a higher
priority.

System-wide header arguments
     Those are specified by customizing ‘org-babel-default-header-args’
     variable, or, for a specific language LANG
     ‘org-babel-default-header-args:LANG’.

Header arguments in properties
     You can set them using ‘header-args’ property (see *note
     Properties::)—or ‘header-args:LANG’ for language LANG.  Header
     arguments set through properties drawers apply at the sub-tree
     level on down.

Header arguments in code blocks
     Header arguments are most commonly set at the source code block
     level, on the ‘BEGIN_SRC’ line:

          #+NAME: factorial
          #+BEGIN_SRC haskell :results silent :exports code :var n=0
            fac 0 = 1
            fac n = n * fac (n-1)
          #+END_SRC

     Code block header arguments can span multiple lines using ‘HEADER’
     keyword on each line.

Evaluating code blocks
======================

Use ‘C-c C-c’ to evaluate the current code block and insert its results
in the Org document.  By default, evaluation is only turned on for
‘emacs-lisp’ code blocks, however support exists for evaluating blocks
in many languages.  For a complete list of supported languages see the
*note manual: (org)Top.  The following shows a code block and its
results.

     #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
       (+ 1 2 3 4)
     #+END_SRC

     #+RESULTS:
     : 10

   The following syntax is used to pass arguments to code blocks using
the ‘var’ header argument.

     :var NAME=ASSIGN

NAME is the name of the variable bound in the code block body.  ASSIGN
is a literal value, such as a string, a number, a reference to a table,
a list, a literal example, another code block—with or without
arguments—or the results of evaluating a code block.

Results of evaluation
=====================

How Org handles results of a code block execution depends on many header
arguments working together.  The primary determinant, however, is the
‘results’ header argument.  It controls the _collection_, _type_,
_format_, and _handling_ of code block results.

Collection
     How the results should be collected from the code block.  You may
     choose either ‘output’ or ‘value’ (the default).

Type
     What result types to expect from the execution of the code block.
     You may choose among ‘table’, ‘list’, ‘scalar’, and ‘file’.  Org
     tries to guess it if you do not provide it.

Format
     How Org processes results.  Some possible values are ‘code’,
     ‘drawer’, ‘html’, ‘latex’, ‘link’, and ‘raw’.

Handling
     How to insert the results once properly formatted.  Allowed values
     are ‘silent’, ‘replace’ (the default), ‘append’, or ‘prepend’.

   Code blocks which output results to files—e.g.: graphs, diagrams and
figures—can accept a ‘:file FILENAME’ header argument, in which case the
results are saved to the named file, and a link to the file is inserted
into the buffer.

Exporting code blocks
=====================

It is possible to export the _code_ of code blocks, the _results_ of
code block evaluation, _both_ the code and the results of code block
evaluation, or _none_.  Org defaults to exporting _code_ for most
languages.

   The ‘exports’ header argument is to specify if that part of the Org
file is exported to, say, HTML or LaTeX formats.  It can be set to
either ‘code’, ‘results’, ‘both’ or ‘none’.

Extracting source code
======================

Use ‘C-c C-v t’ to create pure source code files by extracting code from
source blocks in the current buffer.  This is referred to as
“tangling”—a term adopted from the literate programming community.
During tangling of code blocks their bodies are expanded using
‘org-babel-expand-src-block’, which can expand both variable and “Noweb”
style references.  In order to tangle a code block it must have a
‘tangle’ header argument, see the *note manual: (org)Top. for details.

15 Miscellaneous
****************

Completion
==========

Org has in-buffer completions with ‘M-<TAB>’.  No minibuffer is
involved.  Type one or more letters and invoke the hot key to complete
the text in-place.

   For example, this command will complete TeX symbols after ‘\’, TODO
keywords at the beginning of a headline, and tags after ‘:’ in a
headline.

Structure Templates
===================

To quickly insert empty structural blocks, such as ‘#+BEGIN_SRC’ ...
‘#+END_SRC’, or to wrap existing text in such a block, use

‘C-c C-,’ (‘org-insert-structure-template’)
     Prompt for a type of block structure, and insert the block at
     point.  If the region is active, it is wrapped in the block.

Clean view
==========

Org’s default outline with stars and no indents can become too cluttered
for short documents.  For _book-like_ long documents, the effect is not
as noticeable.  Org provides an alternate stars and indentation scheme,
as shown on the right in the following table.  It uses only one star and
indents text to line with the heading:

     * Top level headline             |    * Top level headline
     ** Second level                  |      * Second level
     *** Third level                  |        * Third level
         some text                    |          some text
     *** Third level                  |        * Third level
         more text                    |          more text
     * Another top level headline     |    * Another top level headline

   This kind of view can be achieved dynamically at display time using
Org Indent mode (‘M-x org-indent-mode <RET>’), which prepends intangible
space to each line.  You can turn on Org Indent mode for all files by
customizing the variable ‘org-startup-indented’, or you can turn it on
for individual files using

     #+STARTUP: indent

   If you want the indentation to be hard space characters so that the
plain text file looks as similar as possible to the Emacs display, Org
supports you by helping to indent (with ‘<TAB>’) text below each
headline, by hiding leading stars, and by only using levels 1, 3, etc to
get two characters indentation for each level.  To get this support in a
file, use

     #+STARTUP: hidestars odd
