Show all entries that contain a phrase or words or regular expressions.

With optional prefix argument TODO-ONLY, only consider entries that are
TODO entries.  The argument STRING can be used to pass a default search
string into this function.  If EDIT-AT is non-nil, it means that the
user should get a chance to edit this string, with cursor at position
EDIT-AT.

The search string can be viewed either as a phrase that should be found as
is, or it can be broken into a number of snippets, each of which must match
in a Boolean way to select an entry.  The default depends on the variable
`org-agenda-search-view-always-boolean'.
Even if this is turned off (the default) you can always switch to
Boolean search dynamically by preceding the first word with  \"+\" or \"-\".

The default is a direct search of the whole phrase, where each space in
the search string can expand to an arbitrary amount of whitespace,
including newlines.

If using a Boolean search, the search string is split on whitespace and
each snippet is searched separately, with logical AND to select an entry.
Words prefixed with a minus must *not* occur in the entry.  Words without
a prefix or prefixed with a plus must occur in the entry.  Matching is
case-insensitive.  Words are enclosed by word delimiters (i.e. they must
match whole words, not parts of a word) if
`org-agenda-search-view-force-full-words' is set (default is nil).

Boolean search snippets enclosed by curly braces are interpreted as
regular expressions that must or (when preceded with \"-\") must not
match in the entry.  Snippets enclosed into double quotes will be taken
as a whole, to include whitespace.

- If the search string starts with an asterisk, search only in headlines.
- If (possibly after the leading star) the search string starts with an
  exclamation mark, this also means to look at TODO entries only, an effect
  that can also be achieved with a prefix argument.
- If (possibly after star and exclamation mark) the search string starts
  with a colon, this will mean that the (non-regexp) snippets of the
  Boolean search must match as full words.

TAB-action and visibility cycling for Org mode.

This is the command invoked in Org mode by the `TAB' key.  Its main
purpose is outline visibility cycling, but it also invokes other actions
in special contexts.

When this function is called with a `\\[universal-argument]' prefix, rotate the entire
buffer through 3 states (global cycling)
  1. OVERVIEW: Show only top-level headlines.
  2. CONTENTS: Show all headlines of all levels, but no body text.
  3. SHOW ALL: Show everything.

With a `\\[universal-argument] \\[universal-argument]' prefix argument, switch to the startup visibility,
determined by the variable `org-startup-folded', and by any VISIBILITY
properties in the buffer.

With a `\\[universal-argument] \\[universal-argument] \\[universal-argument]' prefix argument, show the entire buffer, including
any drawers.

When inside a table, re-align the table and move to the next field.

When point is at the beginning of a headline, rotate the subtree started
by this line through 3 different states (local cycling)
  1. FOLDED:   Only the main headline is shown.
  2. CHILDREN: The main headline and the direct children are shown.
               From this state, you can move to one of the children
               and zoom in further.
  3. SUBTREE:  Show the entire subtree, including body text.
If there is no subtree, switch directly from CHILDREN to FOLDED.

When point is at the beginning of an empty headline and the variable
`org-cycle-level-after-item/entry-creation' is set, cycle the level
of the headline by demoting and promoting it to likely levels.  This
speeds up creation document structure by pressing `TAB' once or several
times right after creating a new headline.

When there is a numeric prefix, go up to a heading with level ARG, do
a `show-subtree' and return to the previous cursor position.  If ARG
is negative, go up that many levels.

When point is not at the beginning of a headline, execute the global
binding for `TAB', which is re-indenting the line.  See the option
`org-cycle-emulate-tab' for details.

As a special case, if point is at the very beginning of the buffer, if
there is no headline there, and if the variable `org-cycle-global-at-bob'
is non-nil, this function acts as if called with prefix argument (`\\[universal-argument] TAB',
same as `S-TAB') also when called without prefix argument.
