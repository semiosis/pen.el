(autoload 'org-recur-finish "org-recur" "\
Reschedule an `org-mode' task according to its org-recur date string.
The org-recur syntax is '|DATE|', where DATE can be either an
absolute date or more commonly a delta, e.g. a task heading
containing '|+2|' indicates to `org-recur-finish' to reschedule
the task to two days from now.

All date strings supported by `org-read-date' are available. Also
available is 'wkdy' (customizable with `org-recur-weekday') which
schedules the task to the next weekday (customizable with
`org-recur-weekday-recurrence'). Also possible is the 'N1,N2,...'
syntax, wherein the earliest date string among the set of N is
selected. For example, '|Mon,Fri|' indicates that the task should
recur every Monday and Friday, and the soonest among them is
chosen when calling `org-recur-finish'.

If the task does not contain org-recur syntax, then depending on
the values of `org-recur-finish-done' and
`org-recur-finish-archive' change the task status to DONE and/or
archive it, respectively" t)
