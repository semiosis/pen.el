File: ess-smart-underscore.info,  Node: Installation,  Next: History,  Prev: Possible Dependencies,  Up: ESS Smart Underscore

1.2 Installation
================

To use without using a package manager:

   * Put the library in a directory in the emacs load path, like
     ~/.emacs.d

   * Add (require 'ess-smart-underscore) in your ~/.emacs file

This is in emacswiki, so this package can also be installed using
el-get.

After installing el-get, Type M-x el-get-install ess-smart-underscore.
## Ess-Smart Underscore Package Information Smart "_" key: insert
`ess-S-assign', unless:

  1. in string/comment

  2. after a $ (like done_two) (toggle with `ess-S-underscore-after-`)

  3. when the underscore is part of a variable definition previously
     defined. (toggle with `ess-S-underscore-after-defined')

  4. when the underscore is after a "=" or "<-" on the same line.

  5. inside a parenthetical statement () or []. (toggle with
     `ess-S-underscore-when-inside-paren')

  6. At the beginning of a line.

  7. In a variable that contains underscores already (for example
     foo_a) (toggle with
     `ess-S-underscore-when-variable-contains-underscores')

  8. The preceding character is not a tab/space (toggle with
     `ess-S-underscore-when-last-character-is-a-space'. Not enabled by
     default.)

An exception to #4 is in the following situation:

a <- b |

Pressing an underscore here would produce

a <- b <-

However when in the following situation

a <- b|

Pressing an underscore would produce

a <- b_

This behavior can be toggled by `ess-S-space-underscore-is-assignment'

If the underscore key is pressed a second time, the assignment operator
is removed and replaced by the underscore. `ess-S-assign', typically "
<- ", can be customized. In ESS modes other than R/S, an underscore is
always inserted.

In addition the ess-smart-underscore attempts to work with noweb-mode

1.3 History
===========

   * *22-May-2013* - Added more ggplot operators. (Matthew L. Fidler)

   * *21-May-2013* - Added math to ggplot's functions... (Matthew L.
     Fidler)

   * *21-May-2013* - Added hook to R-mode to make it behave a little
     better. (Matthew L. Fidler)

   * *15-May-2013* - Fixed ess-smart-underscore to work in an inferior
     R process. (Matthew L. Fidler)

   * *15-May-2013* - Added ggplot function prefixes. (Matthew L. Fidler)

   * *05-Nov-2012* - Better handling of noweb. I think it Came from

   * *22-Feb-2012* - Support unbalanced sexps. (Matthew L. Fidler)

   * *02-Feb-2012* - Took out auto-installing. Most package managers
