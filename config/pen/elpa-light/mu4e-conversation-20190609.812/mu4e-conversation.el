;;; Commentary:
;;
;; This package offers an alternate view to `mu4e' e-mail display.  It shows all
;; e-mails of a thread in a single view, where each correspondant has their own
;; face.  Threads can be displayed linearly (in which case e-mails are displayed
;; in chronological order) or as an Org document where the node tree maps the
;; thread tree.
;;
;; * Setup
;;
;; mu4e 1.0 or above is required.
;;
;; To fully replace `mu4e-view' with `mu4e-conversation' from any other command
;; (e.g. `mu4e-headers-next', `helm-mu'), call
;;
;;   (global-mu4e-conversation-mode)
;;
;; * Features
;;
;; Call `mu4e-conversation-toggle-view' (bound to "V" by default) to switch between
;; linear and tree view.
;;
;; The last section is writable.
;;
;; Call `mu4e-conversation-send' ("C-c C-c" by default) to send the message.
;;
;; When the region is active anywhere in the thread, `mu4e-conversation-cite'
;; ("<return>" by default) will append the selected text as citation to the
;; message being composed.  With prefix argument, the author name will be
;; prepended.
;;
;; Each conversation gets its own buffer.


;;; Code:

;; REVIEW: Overrides are not commended.  Use unwind-protect to set handlers?  I don't think it would work.
;; TODO: Only mark visible messages as read.
;; TODO: Detect subject changes.
;; TODO: Check out mu4e gnus view.
;; TODO: Should we reply to the selected message or to the last?  Make it an option: 'current, 'last, 'ask.
;; TODO: Does toggle-display HTML work?
;; TODO: Save using "save-buffer"?  This would allow different bindings to work
;; transparently (e.g. ":w" with Evil).  Problem is that the draft buffer and
;; the conversation view are different buffers.

;; TODO: Views should be structures with
;; - Thread sort function
;; - Previous / next function
;; - Print function
;; TODO: Indent user messages?  Make formatting more customizable.
;; TODO: Tweak Org indentation?  See `org-adapt-indentation'.

;; REVIEW: Sometimes messages are not marked as read.
;; TODO: When updating new message, mark previous ones as read.
;; TODO: Before next index update, display sent message in special area in buffer.  After index update, remove that area.
;; TODO: Add convenience functions to check if some recipients have been left out, or to return the list of all recipients.
;; TODO: Mark/flag messages that are in thread but not in headers buffer.  See `mu4e-mark-set'.
;; TODO: Fine-tune the recipient list display and composition in linear view.
;; In tree view, we could read properties from the composition subtree.
