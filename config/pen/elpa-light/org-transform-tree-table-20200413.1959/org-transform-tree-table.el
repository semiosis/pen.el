;;
;; Transform an org-mode outline and its properties to a table format
;; (org-table, CSV).

;; This makes it possible to have an outline with properties and work
;; with it in column view. Then you can transform the outline to a table
;; to share with others (export to CSV and open in Excel).

;; More about column view:

;; * http://orgmode.org/worg/org-tutorials/org-column-view-tutorial.html
;; * http://orgmode.org/manual/Column-view.html


;;; Usage
;; -----

;; ### From org tree to table

;;     ;; Org outline to an org table
;;     M-x org-transform-tree/org-table-buffer-from-outline

;;     ;; Org outline to CSV (or rather, tab-separated value)
;;     M-x org-transform-tree/csv-table-buffer-from-outline

;; If the region is active, convert that part of the
;; tree. Otherwise, if point is on an org heading, convert that
;; heading and its subtree. Otherwise convert the buffer.

;; In the resulting table, row one is the column titles. The rest of
;; the rows are property values.

;; Column one is the outline heading, and the rest are the
;; properties in the order they first appear in the buffer.

;; However, all special properties (e.g. 'COLUMNS', '*_ALL') are
;; placed after all the user properties (i.e. whatever properties
;; the user has added to capture information).

;; Special values that can't be represented in an org table are escaped:

;;     |                   ==> \vert{}
;;     first leading space ==> non-breaking space (C-x 8 SPC)


;; ### From table to org tree

;;     ;; From an org table to an org outline
;;     M-x org-transform-table/org-tree-buffer-from-org-table

;;     ;; From CSV (tab separated) to an org outline
;;     M-x org-transform-table/org-tree-buffer-from-csv

;; When converting from an org table, point must be on a table.

;; When converting CSV, convert the buffer.

;; Values escaped from any tree->table transformation are unescaped (see above)



;; Tiny example
;; ------------

;; This outline:

;;     * Pages
;;       :PROPERTIES:
;;       :COLUMNS:  %30ITEM %10Access %10Cost
;;       :END:
;;     ** Products
;;        :PROPERTIES:
;;        :Access:   All
;;        :END:
;;     *** Free Widget
;;         :PROPERTIES:
;;         :Access:   All
;;         :END:
;;     *** Paid Thingy
;;         :PROPERTIES:
;;         :Access:   Paid
;;         :Cost:     30
;;         :END:

;; Transforms into:

;;     | Heading         | Access | Cost | COLUMNS                   |
;;     | * Pages         |        |      | %30ITEM %10Access %10Cost |
;;     | ** Products     | All    |      |                           |
;;     | *** Free Widget | All    |      |                           |
;;     | *** Paid Thingy | Paid   |   30 |                           |

;; Note that the special property COLUMNS are out on the right, to be out
;; of the way when the table is being edited in e.g. Excel or Open
;; Office.

;; This also means the transformation is only 99% round-trip safe and the
;; first time you go back to a tree representation, you'll get more diffs
;; than subsequent ones.


;;; Installation
;; ------------

;; Install org-transform-tree-table using MELPA.

;; Or clone the repo into somewhere in the load-path.

;;     git clone https://github.com/jplindstrom/emacs-org-transform-tree-table.git

;; and initialize with:

;;    (require 'org-transform-tree-table)
