;; Rename Denote buffers to be shorter and easier to read.  Enable
;; `denote-rename-buffer-mode' to automatically rename the buffer of a
;; Denote file.  The renaming function is specified in the user option
;; `denote-rename-buffer-function'.

(defcustom denote-rename-buffer-format "%t"
  "The format of the buffer name `denote-rename-buffer' should use.
Thie value is a string that treats specially the following
specifiers:

- The %t is the Denote TITLE of the file.
- The %i is the Denote IDENTIFIER of the file.
- The %d is the same as %i (DATE mnemonic).
- The %s is the Denote SIGNATURE of the file.
- The %k is the Denote KEYWORDS of the file.
- The %% is a literal percent sign.

In addition, the following flags are available for each of the specifiers:

- 0 :: Pad to the width, if given, with zeros instead of spaces.
- - :: Pad to the width, if given, on the right instead of the left.
- < :: Truncate to the width and precision, if given, on the left.
- > :: Truncate to the width and precision, if given, on the right.
- ^ :: Convert to upper case.
- _ :: Convert to lower case.

When combined all together, the above are written thus:

    %<flags><width><precision>SPECIFIER-CHARACTER

Any other string it taken as-is.  Users may want, for example, to
include some text that makes Denote buffers stand out, such as
a [D] prefix."
