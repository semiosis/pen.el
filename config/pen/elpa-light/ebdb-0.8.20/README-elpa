1 EBDB
══════

  EBDB is a contact management/addressbook package for Emacs.

  It's a re-write of the Insidious Big Brother Database ([BBDB]) using
  Emacs Lisp's (relatively new) object oriented libraries. The "E" is
  vaguely meant to signify "[EIEIO]".

  It lives in both the ELPA repositories, and on Github at
  <https://github.com/girzel/ebdb>. It's best to [install from ELPA],
  but bug reports and pull requests on Github will also be attended to.
  Alternately, run `report-emacs-bugs', include "EBDB" somewhere in the
  subject line, and cc the maintainer.

  More EBDB-related packages are available in ELPA.

  See the [manual] for usage details.
