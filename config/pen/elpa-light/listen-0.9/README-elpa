[file:https://elpa.gnu.org/packages/listen.svg]

This package aims to provide a simple audio/music player for Emacs.  It
should "just work," with little-to-no configuration, have intuitive
commands, and be easily extended and customized.  (Contrast to setting
up EMMS, or having to configure external players like MPD.)  A Transient
menu, under the command `listen', is the primary entry point.

The only external dependency is VLC, which is currently the only player
backend that is supported.  (Other backends may easily be added; see
library `listen-vlc' for example.)  Track metadata is read using EMMS's
native Elisp metadata library, which has been imported into this
package.

Queues are provided as the means to play consecutive tracks, and they
are shown in a `vtable'-based view buffer.  They are persisted between
sessions using the `persist' library, and they may be bookmarked.

The primary interface to one's music library is through the filesystem,
by selecting a file to play, or by adding files and directories to a
queue.  Although MPD is not required, support is provided for finding
files from a local MPD server's library using MPD's metadata searching.

A simple "library" view is provided that shows a list of files organized
into a hierarchy by genre, date, artist, album, etc.  (This will be made
more configurable and useful in the future.)

Note a silly limitation: a track may be present in a queue only once
(but who would want to have a track more than once in a playlist).

3 Installation
══════════════

  *Requirements:*
  • Emacs version 29.1 or later.
  • [VLC]: used to play audio.
  • Optional: `ffprobe' (part of [FFmpeg]) is used to read tracks'
    duration when available.

GNU ELPA
────────

  Listen.el is published in [GNU ELPA] as [listen], so it may be
  installed in Emacs with the command `M-x package-install RET listen
  RET'.  This is the recommended way to install Listen.el, as it will
  install the current stable release.

  The latest development build may be installed from [ELPA-devel] or
  from Git (see below).


[GNU ELPA] <http://elpa.gnu.org/>

[listen] <https://elpa.gnu.org/packages/listen.html>

[ELPA-devel] <https://elpa.gnu.org/devel/listen.html>


Git
───

  The `master' branch of the Git repository is intended to be usable at
  all times; only minor bugs are expected to be found in it before a new
  stable release is made.

  To install, it is recommended to use [quelpa-use-package], like this
  (using [this helpful command] for upgrading versions):

  ┌────
  │ ;; Install and load `quelpa-use-package'.
  │ (package-install 'quelpa-use-package)
  │ (require 'quelpa-use-package)
  │ 
  │ ;; Install Listen.
  │ (use-package listen
  │   :quelpa (listen :fetcher github :repo "alphapapa/listen.el"))
  └────

  One might also use systems like [Elpaca] or [Straight] (which is also
  used by [DOOM]), but the author cannot offer support for them.

4 Configuration
═══════════════

  Listen is intended to work with little-to-no configuration.  You can
  set the `listen-directory' to the location of your music library if
  it's not at `~/Music'.  See `M-x customize-group RET listen RET'.


5 Usage
═══════

  Use the command `listen' to show the Transient menu.  From there, it
  is–hopefully–self-explanatory.  Please feel free to give feedback if
  it doesn't seem so.  For more information, see the following sections.

Queues
──────

  While `listen' can simply play one track and stop, playing multiple
  tracks sequentially is provided by /queues/ (what other players may
  call /playlists/).  A queue is a list of tracks, each of which is
  backed by a file on disk, and which may have associated metadata
  (provided by reading the file in Emacs with the `listen-info' library,
  or from an external source, like an MPD server).

  Queues are automatically persisted to disk in the variable
  `listen-queues'.

  A new, empty queue may be made with the command `listen-queue-new',
  but it's usually more convenient to use a command that adds tracks to
  a queue and enter a new queue name.

  A queue's tracks may be de-duplicated using the command
  `listen-queue-deduplicate'.  Tracks that appear to have the same
  metadata (artist, album, and title, compared case-insensitively) are
  de-duplicated.  Also, any tracks no longer backed by a file are
  removed.


Adding tracks to a queue
╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌

  Tracks can be added to a queue from various sources using these
  commands:

  • Files and directories: `listen-queue-add-files'.  Individual files
    may be chosen, or a directory may be, which will be searched
    recursively for tracks, which are added to the selected queue.
  • From an MPD server: `listen-queue-add-from-mpd'.  An MPD search
    query will be read with completion, and matching tracks are added to
    the selected queue.
  • From a playlist file: `listen-queue-add-from-playlist-file'.  The
    playlist file is read, and its tracks are added to the selected
    queue.


Queue buffer
╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌

  A queue may be shown in a buffer with the command `listen-queue',
  which shows its tracks in a [vtable] with columns for metadata and
  filename.


[vtable] <info:vtable#Introduction>

◊ Commands

  In the buffer, you can use these commands:

  ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
   Listen to track  `listen-queue-play' (`RET') 
  ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

  ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
   Move point forward/backward    `forward-line' (`n') / `previous-line' (`p') 
   Move track forward             `listen-queue-transpose-forward' (`N')       
   Move track backward            `listen-queue-transpose-backward' (`P')      
   Kill track                     `listen-queue-kill-track' (`C-k')            
   Yank track                     `listen-queue-yank' (`C-y')                  
   Show track's metadata          `listen-view-track' (`m')                    
   Jump to track's file in Dired  `listen-jump' (`j')                          
  ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

  ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
   Show tracks (at point or selected) in library buffer  `listen-library-from-queue' (`l')  
   Run shell command on tracks (at point or selected)    `listen-queue-shell-command' (`!') 
  ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

  ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
   Order the queue by column at point  `listen-queue-order-by' (`o') 
   Shuffle the queue                   `listen-queue-shuffle' (`s')  
  ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

  ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
   Revert the queue buffer          `listen-queue-revert' (`g') 
   Revert queue's tracks from disk  `C-u g'                     
   Pause the player                 `listen-pause' (`SPC')      
   Show the menu                    `listen-menu' (`?')         
  ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━


◊ Bookmarks

  Queue buffers may be bookmarked with `bookmark-set' (`C-x r m').  The
  bookmark record refers to the queue by name, so if the queue is
  renamed or discarded, the bookmark will remain.


Queue list buffer
╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌

  The queue list buffer may be shown with the command
  `listen-queue-list'.  In the list buffer, you can use these commands:

  ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
   Show queue's buffer  `listen-queue' (`RET') 
  ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

  ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
   Move point forward/backward            `forward-line' (`n') / `previous-line' (`p') 
   Rename a queue                         `listen-queue-rename' (`R')                  
   Discard a queue                        `listen-queue-discard' (`C-k')               
   Show queue's tracks in library buffer  `listen-library-from-queue' (`l')            
  ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

  ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
   Revert the queue list  `listen-queue-list' (`g') 
   Pause the player       `listen-pause' (`SPC')    
   Show the menu          `listen-menu' (`?')       
  ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━


Library
───────

  To help with exploring and managing a music library, `listen' provides
  various "library" features.  Tracks can be passed between library and
  queue buffers and operated on with similar commands and bindings.

  `listen' does not maintain its own database of audio files; they are
  simply read from the filesystem as needed.  But if a local MPD server
  is available, tracks can be loaded from its database (which does a
  fine job of indexing audio files and their metadata); this is
  generally much faster, because it avoids having to read tracks'
  metadata with Emacs Lisp or their durations with `ffprobe'.

  `listen' does not provide features to modify tracks' metadata, but it
  provides commands to run shell commands on tracks' filenames, which
  works well with external tools like [Picard].


[Picard] <https://picard.musicbrainz.org/>

Library buffer
╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌

  A library buffer provides a hierarchical view of tracks grouped by
  their metadata using [Taxy], rendered with [Magit Section].  Each
  section can be folded, and it shows the number of tracks in it and its
  subgroups.


[Taxy] <info:taxy#Top>

[Magit Section] <info:magit-section#Top>

◊ Showing a library buffer

  Tracks from various sources can be shown in a library using these
  commands:

  • Files and directories: `listen-library'.  Individual files may be
    chosen, or a directory may be, which will be searched recursively
    for tracks.
  • From an MPD server: `listen-library-from-mpd'.  An MPD search query
    will be read with completion, and matching tracks are read from the
    MPD server.
  • From a playlist file: `listen-library-from-playlist-file'.  Tracks
    are read from the given playlist file.


◊ Commands

  In the library buffer, you can use these commands:

  ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
   Listen to tracks     `listen-library-play' (`RET')   
   Add tracks to queue  `listen-library-to-queue' (`a') 
  ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

  ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
   Move point forward/backward    `forward-line' (`n') / `previous-line' (`p') 
   Show track's metadata          `listen-library-view-track' (`m')            
   Jump to track's file in Dired  `listen-library-jump' (`j')                  
  ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

  ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
   Run shell command on tracks  `listen-library-shell-command' (`!') 
  ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

  ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
   Revert the library buffer  `listen-library-revert' (`g') 
   Pause the player           `listen-pause' (`SPC')        
   Show the menu              `listen-menu' (`?')           
  ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━


◊ Bookmarks

  Library buffers may be bookmarked with `bookmark-set' (`C-x r m').
  The bookmark record refers to the buffer by the way it was created
  (e.g. the filename paths, queue name, MPD query, or playlist file the
  tracks came from), so jumping to the bookmark will show an updated
  view, as if calling the original command with the same arguments.


Players
───────

  `listen' currently supports audio playback via the VLC backend.
  Internally, any number of simultaneous player instances could be
  controlled, but `listen''s UI provides the means to control one at a
  time.

  Controlling the player is mainly done through the main [Transient]
  menu, through the command `listen'.  However, all of the commands
  provided in it are also available as interactive commands, which could
  be bound by the user in any keymap (see, e.g. [M-x apropos-command RET
  ^listen- RET]).

  The player is run in a child process, which is started when playback
  begins.  The `listen-quit' command terminates the player process.


[Transient] <info:transient#Top>

[M-x apropos-command RET ^listen- RET] <elisp:(apropos-command
"^listen-")>

Volume
╌╌╌╌╌╌

  The `listen-volume' command is used to set the current player's
  volume.  Its argument should be an integer percentage.  Some players,
  e.g. VLC, may allow settings above 100% to boost output beyond normal
  levels.


Seeking
╌╌╌╌╌╌╌

  The `listen-seek' command is used to seek to a position in the current
  track.  Its argument should be a timestamp in MM:SS format, and it may
  include a `-' or `+' prefix to indicate a position relative to the
  current one.


Repeat modes
╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌

  Three repeat modes are provided, controlled by the option
  `listen-queue-repeat-mode', which may have these values:

  `nil'
        No repeating.  When the last track in the current queue finishes
        playing, playback stops.
  `queue'
        The current queue is repeated when its last track finishes
        playing.
  `shuffle'
        When the last track in the current queue finishes playing, the
        queue is shuffled and played again.

  The repeat mode is most easily set using the commands in the `listen'
  menu.


Mode
────

  The `listen-mode' minor mode runs a timer which plays the next track
  in the current queue when a track finishes playing (when playing a
  queue).  It is automatically activated when playing a queue.  It also
  shows the current track in the `global-mode-string', which may be
  displayed in the mode line or tab bar.


Tips
────

  • Since VLC is used as a backend, [MPRIS]-based player info and
    controls "just work", so you can use things like media hotkeys and
    various widgets to control `listen''s playback.
  • Similarly, you might even see an icon in your task switcher
    indicating that Emacs is playing sound (e.g. with KDE Plasma).

  • Show track ratings in library and queue buffers.

  *Changes*
  • All metadata in MP3 and Ogg files is available for display (not only
    standard tags).
  • For date field in library and queue views, show `originalyear' or
    `originaldate' metadata fields in preference to `date' (which seems
    generally more useful, as the `date' field may contain a full date,
    and sometimes of a later release).

  *Fixes*
  • Increase timeout for reading track durations.
  • Command `listen-queue-deduplicate' first removes any tracks not
    backed by a file.

  • Command `listen-queue' doesn't recreate its buffer when already
    open.
  • Key bindings in `listen' Transient menu.
  • Function `listen-queue-complete' accepts argument `:allow-new-p' to
    return a new queue if the entered name doesn't match an existing
    one.

  *Fixes*
  • Completing read of tracks from MPD.
  • Unset VLC process's query-on-exit flag.

Known issues
────────────

  • Queue buffers that are not visible during playback are not updated
    automatically (i.e. to show the currently playing track).  This is
    due to a limitation of the `vtable' library (see [bug #69837]).
