;; Quick start:
(defconst miniedit-quick-start
  "Drop this file somewhere in your load-path, and add somewhere in your  .emacs.
 \(require 'miniedit\)
 \(miniedit-install\)
Xemacsers use \(miniedit-install-for-xemacs\) instead of
\(miniedit-install\).

Installation can also be done by customizing the variable `miniedit-install'.

Then, type M-C-e in any minibuffer to do nicer edits, and type M-C-c
or C-c C-c when done.

Please type M-x miniedit-introduction, M-x miniedit-quick-start and
M-x miniedit-commentary for more details. "

;;; Introduction:
;; Stuff that gets posted to gnu.emacs.sources
;; as introduction
(defconst miniedit-introduction
  "Helps easily edit minibuffers.
Adds a key \"C-M-e\" \(e for edit\) to the minibuffer-local-map, and
other similar maps, and bind it to the function `miniedit'. This
means that when you are in a minibuffer, trying to input text,
you can type C-M-e to go enter those fields in a nice, full buffer
\(with text mode\) instead.  In particular, inserting new lines and
indenting is easy.  Helpful, for instance, when editing bbdb notes
fields, which tend to be multiline, \(right?\)

P.S.: Lots of code borrowed from checkdoc.

Tested mainly on emacs21.  It may now work even on Xemacs, `
atleast for some of the minibuffer-maps.

Please type M-x miniedit-introduction, M-x miniedit-quick-start and
M-x miniedit-commentary for more details. ")

;;; BUGS:
;;   Commit problem:  Once you are in the miniedit buffer, if you move
;;   buffers around, switch back and forth etc., the commit *sometimes*
;;   fails.. the author is working on this.... :)
;;   that is why we kill-new and have variables like
;;   miniedit-before-edit-kill-p and miniedit-after-edit-kill-p. -- to
;;   save any lost data.
