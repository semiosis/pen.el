Minor mode that keeps an up-to-date syntax tree using incremental parsing.

This is a minor mode.  If called interactively, toggle the
`tree-sitter mode' mode.  If the prefix argument is positive,
enable the mode,  and if it is zero or negative, disable the
mode.

If called from Lisp, toggle the mode if ARG is `toggle'.  Enable
the mode if ARG is nil, omitted, or is a positive number.
Disable the mode if ARG is a negative number.

To check whether the minor mode is enabled in the current buffer,
evaluate `tree-sitter-mode'.

The mode's hook is called both when the mode is enabled and when
it is disabled.

much, this macro behaves like `save-excursion', unless
`tree-sitter-save-excursion-try-hard' is non-nil, in which case it tries to get
as close as possible to the original location.

After the location is restored, the buffer text is scrolled so that point stays
at roughly the same vertical screen position. If `pixel-scroll' is available and
`tree-sitter-save-excursion-pixelwise' is non-nil, pixelwise scrolling is used
instead, to make this restoration exact.

applied to. If LANG-SYMBOL is nil, PATTERNS are applied to the current buffer,
