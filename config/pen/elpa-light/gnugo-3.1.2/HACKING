HACKING gnugo                                           -*- org -*-

This file is both a guide for newcomers and a todo list for oldstayers.

* next
*** newbie support
***** "don't panic" button :-D
***** on gnugo.el load, check [[file:gnugo.el::defvar.gnugo-program][gnugo-program]], set "ready" state
***** rat concessions :-/
***** (?) ootb ‘gnugo-image-display-mode’ in ‘gnugo-start-game-hook’
* fix bugs
*** empty tree from many back/forw
***** intermittent, grr
***** manifests as ‘()’ (empty list) in .sgf (on write)
*** {next,previous}-line weirdness in the presence of images
*** no error-handling in SGF parsing
* performance
*** ‘compare-strings’ approach too clever/slow :-/
*** cache frolic fruits
* ideas / wishlist
*** wrap GTP ‘loadsgf’ completely
*** revamp image support
***** DONE zonk ‘require’
***** define simple API
*** talk GTP over the network
    (?) pending [[wrap GTP ‘loadsgf’ completely]]
*** make gnugo (the external program) support query (read-only) thread
*** extend GNUGO Board mode to manage another subprocess for analysis only
*** command to label a position
*** SGF tree traversal
***** DONE monkey mind
***** TODO monkey body
*** "undo undo undoing"
***** integrate Emacs undo, GTP undo, subgame branching
***** (?) use [[file:../undo-tree/][../undo-tree/]]
*** make buffer name format configurable (but enforce uniqueness)
*** more tilde escapes for [[file:gnugo.el::defvar.gnugo-mode-line][gnugo-mode-line]]
*** make veneration configurable (see also [[SVG display]])
*** animation finery
***** make more configurable
***** lift same-color-stones-only restriction
***** allow sequencing rather than lock-step
***** include sound
*** plunder el-go (grok [[info:eieio.info][EIEIO]] first)
***** SVG display
      pending [[revamp image support]]
***** (?) SGF support
******* IR compat
******* error handling
***** (?) other "backends"
      pending [[talk GTP over the network]]
*** [your hacking ideas here!]
* tested with (newest first)
  | Emacs     | GNU Go |
  |-----------+--------|
  | 26.0.50.6 | 3.8    |
  | 24.3.50.3 | 3.8    |
  | ?         | 3.6    |
  | ?         | 3.4    |
  | ?         | 3.3.15 |
  | 22.0.50   | ?      |
  | 21.3      | ?      |
  |-----------+--------|
  | <l>       | <l>    |
* ChangeLog discipline
*** based on [[info:standards#Change%20Logs][GNU Coding Standards]]
*** commit-message format
***** basic: TITLE LF LF [DISCUSSION...] LF LF CLASSIC
***** short: TITLE-FRAGMENT "; nfc." [LF LF DISCUSSION...]
*** don't bother w/ ChangeLog for "short" commit-message format
* copyright policy
*** update every year, unconditionally
*** (if (< 2 (- END BEGIN)) RANGE INDIVIDUAL)
* other conventions: see [[file:.dir-locals.el][.dir-locals.el]]
* NEWS nostalgia
(with-current-buffer (find-file "NEWS")
  (highlight-phrase "[0-9][.][0-9][.][0-9]+\\|[0-9]+[.][.][0-9]+"
                    'hi-red-b))
* etc
