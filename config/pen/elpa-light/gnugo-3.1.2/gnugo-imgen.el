;; This file provides func `gnugo-imgen-create-xpms', suitable as
;; value for `gnugo-xpms', and several variables to configure it:
;;
;;  `gnugo-imgen-styles'
;;  `gnugo-imgen-style'
;;  `gnugo-imgen-sizing-function'
;;  `gnugo-imgen-char-height-fudge-factor'

;; There is also one command: `gnugo-imgen-clear-cache'.

  "How much to fudge the character height in the fitting function.
At its heart, gnugo-imgen uses ‘window-inside-absolute-pixel-edges’,
which (at *its* heart, in turn) is a very complex calculation.
For some versions of Emacs, this may result in the generated
board being larger than the actual visible frame, which is ugly.

You can use ‘gnugo-imgen-char-height-fudge-factor’ to make things
look right (or at least, better).  If the board looks too big,
set this to a small positive number (4.2 works for the author).
The bigger the factor, the smaller the board.")
