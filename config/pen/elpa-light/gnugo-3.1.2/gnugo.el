;; Playing
;; -------
;;
;; This file provides the command `gnugo' which allows you to play the game of
;; go against the external program "gnugo" (https://www.gnu.org/software/gnugo)
;; in a dedicated Emacs buffer, or to resume a game in progress.  NOTE: In
;; this file, to avoid confusion w/ elisp vars and funcs, we use the term "GNU
;; Go" to refer to the process object created by running the external program.
;;
;; At the start of a new game, you can pass additional command-line arguments
;; to GNU Go to specify level, board size, color, komi, handicap, etc.  By
;; default GNU Go plays at level 10, board size 19, color white, and zero for
;; both komi and handicap.
;;
;; To play a stone, move the cursor to the desired vertice and type `SPC' or
;; `RET'; to pass, `P' (note: uppercase); to quit, `q'; to undo one of your
;; moves (as well as a possibly intervening move by GNU Go), `u'.  To undo
;; back through an arbitrary stone that you played, place the cursor on a
;; stone and type `U' (note: uppercase).
;;
;; There are a great many other commands.  Other keybindings are described in
;; the `gnugo-board-mode' documentation, which you may view with the command
;; `describe-mode' (normally `C-h m') in that buffer.  The buffer name shows
;; the last move and who is currently to play.  Capture counts and other info
;; are shown on the mode line immediately following the major mode name.
;;
;; While GNU Go is pondering its next move, certain commands that rely on its
;; assistence will result in a "still waiting" error.  Do not be alarmed; that
;; is normal.  When it is your turn again you may retry the command.  In the
;; meantime, you can use Emacs for other tasks, or start an entirely new game
;; with `C-u M-x gnugo'.  (NOTE: A new game will slow down all games. :-)
;;
;; If GNU Go should crash during a game the mode line will show "no process".
;; Please report the event to the GNU Go maintainers so that they can improve
;; the program.

LOCATION is an integer encoding edge, corner, or center:

For instance, 4 means \"left edge\", 9 means \"bottom right\".

There is only one location for hoshi: center.  The other five
