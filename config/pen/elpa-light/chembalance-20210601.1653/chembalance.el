;;; Commentary:
;;
;; Balance chemical equations.
;;
;; Installation:
;;
;; After installing the package (or copying it to your load-path), add this
;; to your init file:
;;
;; (require 'chembalance)
;;
;; It works interactively (entering your equation at the minibuffer) and
;; also with region.
;;
;; M-x chembalance => goes to the minibuffer.  Enter equation.
;; (Ex.  FeS + O2 => Fe2O3 + SO2)
;;
;; It returns:
;;
;; => Balanced reaction : 4 FeS + 7 O2 => 2 Fe2O3 + 4 SO2
;;
;; You can also use it to check if a reaction is already balanced.
;;
;; You can mark a region with a chemical equation and then M-x
;; chembalance.  It will give you the balanced equation.
;;
;; Chembalance supports formulas with parentheses (Ex: Fe(OH)2)
;;
;; Customize:
;; 
;; To customize chembalance, do M-x customize-group RET chembalance.
;;
;; There are two custom variables:
;;
;; chembalance-arrow-syntax (list of accepted arrows).
;;
;; chembalance-insert-string (if non-nil, when you call chembalance with
;; selected region, chembalance will kill that region and insert the
;; balanced reaction).
;;
;; Please, email me your comments, bugs, improvements or opinions on
;; this package to sergi.ruiz.trepat@gmail.com
