Configure or reconfigure a CMake build tree.
BUILD-DIRECTORY is the path to the build-tree directory.  If the
directory does not already exist, it will be created.  The source
directory is found automatically based on the current

Minor mode that integrates a CMake-based project with Emacs

build tools such as the CompileCommand and Flymake.

This is a minor mode.  If called interactively, toggle the
`CMake-Project mode' mode.  If the prefix argument is positive,
enable the mode,  and if it is zero or negative, disable the
mode.

If called from Lisp, toggle the mode if ARG is `toggle'.  Enable
the mode if ARG is nil, omitted, or is a positive number.
Disable the mode if ARG is a negative number.

To check whether the minor mode is enabled in the current buffer,
evaluate `cmake-project-mode'.

The mode's hook is called both when the mode is enabled and when
it is disabled.
