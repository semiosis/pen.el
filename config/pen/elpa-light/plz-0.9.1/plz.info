(http://elpa.gnu.org/packages/plz.html)

   ‘plz’ is an HTTP library for Emacs.  It uses ‘curl’ as a backend,
which avoids some of the issues with using Emacs’s built-in ‘url’
library.  It supports both synchronous and asynchronous requests.  Its
API is intended to be simple, natural, and expressive.  Its code is
intended to be simple and well-organized.  Every feature is tested
against httpbin (https://httpbin.org/).

File: docj5aN1E.info,  Node: GNU ELPA,  Next: Manual,  Up: Installation

1.1 GNU ELPA
============

‘plz’ is available in GNU ELPA (http://elpa.gnu.org/packages/plz.html).
It may be installed in Emacs using the ‘package-install’ command.


File: docj5aN1E.info,  Node: Manual,  Prev: GNU ELPA,  Up: Installation

1.2 Manual
==========

‘plz’ has no dependencies other than Emacs and ‘curl’.  It’s known to
work on Emacs 26.3 or later.  To install it manually, simply place
‘plz.el’ in your ‘load-path’ and ‘(require 'plz)’.

2 Usage
*******

The main public function is ‘plz’, which sends an HTTP request and
returns either the result of the specified type (for a synchronous
request), or the ‘curl’ process object (for asynchronous requests).  For
asynchronous requests, callback, error-handling, and finalizer functions
may be specified, as well as various other options.

2.1 Examples
============

Synchronously ‘GET’ a URL and return the response body as a decoded
string (here, raw JSON):

     (plz 'get "https://httpbin.org/user-agent")

     "{\n \"user-agent\": \"curl/7.35.0\"\n}\n"

   Synchronously ‘GET’ a URL that returns a JSON object, and parse and
return it as an alist:

     (plz 'get "https://httpbin.org/get" :as #'json-read)

     ((args)
      (headers
       (Accept . "*/*")
       (Accept-Encoding . "deflate, gzip")
       (Host . "httpbin.org")
       (User-Agent . "curl/7.35.0"))
      (url . "https://httpbin.org/get"))

   Asynchronously ‘POST’ a JSON object in the request body, then parse a
JSON object from the response body, and call a function with the result:

     (plz 'post "https://httpbin.org/post"
       :headers '(("Content-Type" . "application/json"))
       :body (json-encode '(("key" . "value")))
       :as #'json-read
       :then (lambda (alist)
               (message "Result: %s" (alist-get 'data alist))))

     Result: {"key":"value"}

   Synchronously download a JPEG file, then create an Emacs image object
from the data:

     (let ((jpeg-data (plz 'get "https://httpbin.org/image/jpeg" :as 'binary)))
       (create-image jpeg-data nil 'data))

     (image :type jpeg :data ""ÿØÿà^@^PJFIF...")

2.2 Functions
=============

‘plz’
     _(method url &key headers body else finally noquery (as ’string)
     (then ’sync) (body-type ’text) (decode t decode-s) (connect-timeout
     plz-connect-timeout) (timeout plz-timeout))_

     Request ‘METHOD’ from ‘URL’ with curl.  Return the curl process
     object or, for a synchronous request, the selected result.

     ‘HEADERS’ may be an alist of extra headers to send with the
     request.

     ‘BODY’ may be a string, a buffer, or a list like ‘(file FILENAME)’
     to upload a file from disk.

     ‘BODY-TYPE’ may be ‘text’ to send ‘BODY’ as text, or ‘binary’ to
     send it as binary.

     ‘AS’ selects the kind of result to pass to the callback function
     ‘THEN’, or the kind of result to return for synchronous requests.
     It may be:

        • ‘buffer’ to pass the response buffer, which will be narrowed
          to the response body and decoded according to ‘DECODE’.
        • ‘binary’ to pass the response body as an un-decoded string.
        • ‘string’ to pass the response body as a decoded string.
        • ‘response’ to pass a ‘plz-response’ structure.
        • ‘file’ to pass a temporary filename to which the response body
          has been saved without decoding.
        • ‘(file ~FILENAME)’ to pass ‘FILENAME’ after having saved the
          response body to it without decoding.  ‘FILENAME’ must be a
          non-existent file; if it exists, it will not be overwritten,
          and an error will be signaled.  ‘FILENAME’ is passed through
          ‘expand-file-name’, which see.
        • A function, which is called in the response buffer with it
          narrowed to the response body (suitable for, e.g.
          ‘json-read’).

     If ‘DECODE’ is non-nil, the response body is decoded automatically.
     For binary content, it should be nil.  When ‘AS’ is ‘binary’,
     ‘DECODE’ is automatically set to nil.

     ‘THEN’ is a callback function, whose sole argument is selected
     above with ‘AS’; if the request fails and no ‘ELSE’ function is
     given (see below), the argument will be a ‘plz-error’ structure
     describing the error.  Or ‘THEN’ may be ‘sync’ to make a
     synchronous request, in which case the result is returned directly
     from this function.

     ‘ELSE’ is an optional callback function called when the request
     fails (i.e.  if curl fails, or if the ‘HTTP’ response has a non-2xx
     status code).  It is called with one argument, a ‘plz-error’
     structure.  If ‘ELSE’ is nil, a ‘plz-curl-error’ or
     ‘plz-http-error’ is signaled when the request fails, with a
     ‘plz-error’ structure as the error data.  For synchronous requests,
     this argument is ignored.

     ‘NOTE’: In v0.8 of ‘plz’, only one error will be signaled:
     ‘plz-error’.  The existing errors, ‘plz-curl-error’ and
     ‘plz-http-error’, inherit from ‘plz-error’ to allow applications to
     update their code while using v0.7 (i.e.  any ‘condition-case’
     forms should now handle only ‘plz-error’, not the other two).

     ‘FINALLY’ is an optional function called without argument after
     ‘THEN’ or ‘ELSE’, as appropriate.  For synchronous requests, this
     argument is ignored.

     ‘CONNECT-TIMEOUT’ and ‘TIMEOUT’ are a number of seconds that limit
     how long it takes to connect to a host and to receive a response
     from a host, respectively.

     ‘NOQUERY’ is passed to ‘make-process’, which see.

     ‘FILTER’ is an optional function to be used as the process filter
     for the curl process.  It can be used to handle HTTP responses in a
     streaming way.  The function must accept 2 arguments, the process
     object running curl, and a string which is output received from the
     process.  The default process filter inserts the output of the
     process into the process buffer.  The provided ‘FILTER’ function
     should at least insert output up to the HTTP body into the process
     buffer.

2.3 Queueing
============

‘plz’ provides a simple system for queueing HTTP requests.  First, make
a ‘plz-queue’ struct by calling ‘make-plz-queue’.  Then call ‘plz-queue’
with the struct as the first argument, and the rest of the arguments
being the same as those passed to ‘plz’.  Then call ‘plz-run’ to run the
queued requests.

   All of the queue-related functions return the queue as their value,
making them easy to use.  For example:

     (defvar my-queue (make-plz-queue :limit 2))

     (plz-run
      (plz-queue my-queue
        'get "https://httpbin.org/get?foo=0"
        :then (lambda (body) (message "%s" body))))

   Or:

     (let ((queue (make-plz-queue :limit 2
                                  :finally (lambda ()
                                             (message "Queue empty."))))
           (urls '("https://httpbin.org/get?foo=0"
                   "https://httpbin.org/get?foo=1")))
       (plz-run
        (dolist (url urls queue)
          (plz-queue queue 'get url
            :then (lambda (body) (message "%s" body))))))

   You may also clear a queue with ‘plz-clear’, which cancels any active
or queued requests and calls their ‘:else’ functions.  And ‘plz-length’
returns the number of a queue’s active and queued requests.

2.4 Tips
========

   • You can customize settings in the ‘plz’ group, but this can only be
     used to adjust a few defaults.  It’s not intended that changing or
     binding global variables be necessary for normal operation.

     applied to filenames passed for uploading).  (Thanks to Joseph
     Turner (https://github.com/josephmturner).)


File: docj5aN1E.info,  Node: 09,  Next: 08,  Prev: 091,  Up: Changelog

3.2 0.9
=======

*Compatibility*

   • The minimum supported Emacs version is now 27.1.  (It is no longer
     practical to test ‘plz’ with Emacs versions older than 27.1.  For
     Emacs 26.3, an earlier version of ‘plz’ may be used, or this
     version might be compatible, with or without minor changes, which
     the maintainer cannot offer support for.)

   *Changes*

   • Option ‘plz-timeout’ is removed.  (It was the default value for
     ‘plz’’s ‘:timeout’ argument, which is passed to Curl as its
     ‘--max-time’ argument, limiting the total duration of a request
     operation.  This argument should be unset by default, because
     larger or slower downloads might not finish within a certain
     duration, and it is surprising to the user to have this option set
     by default, potentially causing requests to timeout unnecessarily.)
   • Using arguments ‘:as 'file’ or ‘:as '(file FILENAME)’ now passes
     the filename to Curl, allowing it to write the data to the file
     itself (rather than receiving the data into an Emacs buffer and
     then writing it to a file.  This improves performance when
     downloading large files, significantly reducing Emacs’s CPU and
     memory usage).

   *Fixes*

   • Improve workaround for Emacs’s process sentinel-related issues.
     (Don’t try to process response a second time if Emacs calls the
     sentinel after ‘plz’ has returned for a synchronous request.  See
     #53 (https://github.com/alphapapa/plz.el/issues/53).  Thanks to
     Joseph Turner (https://github.com/josephmturner) for extensive help
     debugging, and to USHIN (https://ushin.org/) for sponsoring some of
     this work.)
   • Inhibit buffer hooks when calling ‘generate-new-buffer’ (as extra
     protection against "kill buffer?"  prompts in case of errors).
     (See #52 (https://github.com/alphapapa/plz.el/pull/52).  Thanks to
     Michał Krzywkowski (https://github.com/mkcms).)
        • Avoid "kill buffer?"  prompts in case of errors on Emacs
          versions before 28.  (See #52
          (https://github.com/alphapapa/plz.el/pull/52) and #57
          (https://github.com/alphapapa/plz.el/issues/57).  Thanks to
          Michał Krzywkowski (https://github.com/mkcms).)

   *Development*

   • ‘plz’ is now automatically tested against Emacs versions 27.1,
     27.2, 28.1, 28.2, 29.1, 29.2, 29.3, and a recent snapshot of the
     ‘master’ branch (adding 29.2 and 29.3).

File: docj5aN1E.info,  Node: 07,  Next: 06,  Prev: 071,  Up: Changelog

3.7 0.7
=======

*Changes*
   • A new error signal, ‘plz-error’, is defined.  The existing signals,
     ‘plz-curl-error’ and ‘plz-http-error’, inherit from it, so handling
     ‘plz-error’ catches both.

     *NOTE:* The existing signals, ‘plz-curl-error’ and
     ‘plz-http-error’, are hereby deprecated, and they will be removed
     in v0.8.  Applications should be updated while using v0.7 to only
     expect ‘plz-error’.

   *Fixes*
   • Significant improvement in reliability by implementing failsafes
     and workarounds for Emacs’s process-handling code.  (See #3
     (https://github.com/alphapapa/plz.el/issues/3).)
   • STDERR output from curl processes is not included in response
     bodies (which sometimes happened, depending on Emacs’s internal
     race conditions).  (Fixes #23
     (https://github.com/alphapapa/plz.el/issues/23).)
   • Use ‘with-local-quit’ for synchronous requests (preventing Emacs
     from complaining sometimes).  (Fixes #26
     (https://github.com/alphapapa/plz.el/issues/26).)
   • Various fixes for ‘:as 'buffer’ result type: decode body when
     appropriate; unset multibyte for binary; narrow to body; don’t kill
     buffer prematurely.
   • When clearing a queue, don’t try to kill finished processes.

   *Internal*
   • Response processing now happens outside the process sentinel, so
     any errors (e.g.  in user callbacks) are not signaled from inside
     the sentinel.  (This avoids the 2-second pause Emacs imposes in
     such cases.)
   • Tests run against a local instance of httpbin
     (https://github.com/postmanlabs/httpbin) (since the ‘httpbin.org’
     server is often overloaded).
   • No buffer-local variables are defined anymore; process properties
     are used instead.


File: docj5aN1E.info,  Node: 06,  Next: 054,  Prev: 07,  Up: Changelog

3.8 0.6
=======

*Additions*
   • Function ‘plz’’s ‘:body’ argument now accepts a list like ‘(file
     FILENAME)’ to upload a file from disk (by passing the filename to
     curl, rather than reading its content into Emacs and sending it to
     curl through the pipe).

   *Fixes*
   • Function ‘plz’’s docstring now mentions that the ‘:body’ argument
     may also be a buffer (an intentional feature that was accidentally
     undocumented).
   • Handle HTTP 3xx redirects when using ‘:as 'response’.
