This is the NEWS file for Emacs Chess, a chess client and analysis library
written in Emacs Lisp.


* Release 2.0.4:

This is yet another bugfix release, no new features.

** Fix a bug in PGN annotation parsing.

** Fix missing dependencies in the ECO module.

** Make the third argument of `chess-display-draw-square' optional, as expected
   by the rest of the code.

** Fix a bug where PGN mode could not load the `chess-file' module.


* Release 2.0.3:

This is a bugfix release which fixes a recursive dependency between
`chess-display' and `chess-pgn' which was accidentally missed in 2.0.2.

Also included is further proof-reading of the Info manual.


* Release 2.0.2:

** Major updates to the Info manual.

** Algebraic move input:

*** It is now possible to enter moves in numeric notation by
    customizing `chess-input-notation-type'.

*** Backspace (DEL) on terminals now deletes input as expected.

*** If `chess-display-highlight-legal' is non-nil, target squares of
    posssible moves are highlighted while you type.

** The board and modeline is now correctly updated when making a move against
   the internal engine (AI).

** An error when editing positions with the `chess-plain' display has been fixed.

** Legal move target highlights are now properly removed again once a move
   has been selected, or the selected piece has been deselected.

*** As a consequence of this fix, `chess-display-highlight-legal' is now
    on by default.

** `chess-ply-to-algebraic' can now generate figurine algebraic and
   numeric notation.

** `chess-algebraic-to-ply' can now handle figurine algebraic notation.

** Several compiler warnings have been fixed.
   
** The `chess-autosave' module is disabled by default for now.

** The incomplete and unused constant `chess-piece-name-table' has been removed.


* Release 2.0.1:

** chess-polyglot now works on 32-bit platforms.

** Redo `chess-algebraic-regexp' with `rx' to improve readability.

** Fix "invalid function" error in `chess-search-position'.
   This was introduced by the recent conversion
   of `chess--add-candidates' from a defsubst to a defmacro.


* Release 2.0.0:

Began keeping this file.  See doc/chess.info for information about Emacs
