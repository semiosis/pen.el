;;; Commentary:

;; A ply is the differential between two positions.  Or, it is the
;; coordinate transformations applied to one position in order to
;; arrive at the following position.  It is also informally called "a
;; move".
;;
;; A ply is represented in Lisp using a cons cell of the form:
;;
;;   (BASE-POSITION .
;;    (FROM-COORD1 TO-COORD1 [FROM-COORD2 TO-COORD2] [KEYWORDS]))
;;
;; The KEYWORDS indicate special actions that are not really chess
;; moves:
;;
;;   :promote PIECE     ; promote pawn to PIECE on arrival
;;   :resign            ; a resignation causes the game to end
;;   :stalemate
;;   :repetition
;;   :perpetual
;;   :check             ; check is announced
;;   :checkmate
;;   :draw              ; a draw was offered and accepted
;;   :draw-offered      ; a draw was offered but not accepted
;;
;; A ply may be represented in ASCII by printing the FEN string of the
;; base position, and then printing the positional transformation in
;; algebraic notation.  Since the starting position is usually known,
;; the FEN string is optional.  A ply may be represented graphically
;; by moving the chess piece(s) involved.  It may be rendered verbally
;; by voicing which piece is to move, where it will move to, and what
;; will happen a result of the move (piece capture, check, etc).
;;
;; Plies may be sent over network connections, postal mail, e-mail,
;; etc., so long as the current position is maintained at both sides.
;; Transmitting the base position's FEN string along with the ply
;; offers a form of confirmation during the course of a game.
