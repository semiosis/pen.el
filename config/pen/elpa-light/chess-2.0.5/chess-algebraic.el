;;; Commentary:

;; A thing to deal with in chess is algebraic move notation, such as
;; Nxf3+.  (I leave description of this notation to better manuals
;; than this).  This notation is a shorthand way of representing where
;; a piece is moving from and to, by specifying the piece is involved,
;; where it's going, and whether or not a capture or check is
;; involved.
;;
;; You can convert from algebraic notation to a ply (one pair in most
;; cases, but two for a castle) using the following function (NOTE:
;; POSITION determines which side is on move (by calling
;; `chess-pos-side-to-move')):
;;
;;    (chess-algebraic-to-ply POSITION STRING)
;;
;; The function also checks if a move is legal, and will raise an
;; error if not.
;;
;; To convert from a ply to algebraic notation, use:
;;
;;    (chess-ply-to-algebraic PLY)
;;
;; Castling is determined by the movement of both a king and a rook.
;;
;; Lastly, there is a regexp for quickly checking if a string is in
;; algebraic notation or not, or searching out algebraic strings in a
;; buffer:
;;
;;    chess-algebraic-regexp
