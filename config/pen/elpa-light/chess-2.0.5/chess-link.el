;;; Commentary:

;; A module for connecting two engines.  If one is a protocol
;; transport (like chess-network), and the other is a computing engine
;; (like chess-gnuchess), this will allow you to expose a bot over the
;; channel.

;;; Code:

(require 'chess)
(require 'chess-engine)

(defun chess-link-response-handler (event &rest args)
  "This function handles responses from the bot's computing engine."
  (let ((first-engine
	 (chess-game-data (chess-engine-game nil) 'first-engine))
	(second-engine
	 (chess-game-data (chess-engine-game nil) 'second-engine))
	return-value)
    (cond
     ((eq event 'match)
      (chess-engine-command nil 'accept)
      t)

     (t
      (let ((chess-engine-inhibit-auto-pass t))
	(setq return-value
	      (apply #'chess-engine-default-handler event args)))

      ;; but now transfer the event to the other engine
      (apply #'chess-engine-command
	     (if (eq (current-buffer) first-engine)
		 second-engine
	       first-engine)
	     event args)

      return-value))))

(defun chess-link-connect (first-engine second-engine)
  "Connect two engines, so that they rely events back and forth."
  (chess-engine-set-response-handler first-engine
				     'chess-link-response-handler)
  (chess-engine-set-response-handler second-engine
				     'chess-link-response-handler))
