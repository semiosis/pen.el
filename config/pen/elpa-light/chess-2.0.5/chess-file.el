;;; Commentary:

;; A game database that stores PGN or EPD format positions in a single file.
;;
;; This is basically what you expect from a file ending in .pgn or .epd.

See `chess-file-types' for details.")

	 chess-epd-to-game chess-game-to-epd (?\n)))
  "Alist of different file types.
Entries have the form (TYPE BEGIN-REGEXP TO-GAME FROM-GAME SEPARATOR)
where TYPE is a symbol (usually either 'pgn or 'epd),
BEGIN-REGEXP is the regexp to use for matching the beginning of new records,
TO-GAME and FROM-GAME are functions to use for reading and writing a game
object from/into the buffer and SEPARATOR is a list of characters to insert
inbetween of individual records.")
