(define-minor-mode racket-smart-open-bracket-mode
  "Minor mode to let you always type `[`' to insert `(` or `[` automatically.

Behaves like the \"Automatically adjust opening square brackets\"
feature in Dr. Racket.

By default, inserts a `(`. Inserts a `[` in the following cases:

  - `let`-like bindings -- forms with `let` in the name as well
    as things like `parameterize`, `with-handlers`, and
    `with-syntax`.

  - `case`, `cond`, `match`, `syntax-case`, `syntax-parse`, and
    `syntax-rules` clauses.

  - `for`-like bindings and `for/fold` accumulators.

  - `class` declaration syntax, such as `init` and `inherit`.

When the previous s-expression in a sequence is a compound
expression, uses the same kind of delimiter.

To force insert `[`, use `quoted-insert'.

Combined with `racket-insert-closing' this means that you can
press the unshifted `[` and `]` keys to get whatever delimiters
follow the Racket conventions for these forms. When something
like `electric-pair-mode' or `paredit-mode' is active, you need
not even press `]`.

Tip: When also using `paredit-mode', enable that first so that
the binding for the `[`' key in the map for
`racket-smart-open-bracket-mode' has higher priority. See also
the variable `minor-mode-map-alist'."
