- New features and improvements ::
  Refer to the updated README on new features and changed command names
  - 7e5c839 * feat: exclude-elements
  - 765d8ee * add :disable-auto
  - afd6d80 * add: :only-contents
  - cbb1c25 * add: apply :level to buffer with first section ::
    Fix #47 The first section itself does not get influenced by :level property.  The first headline, when present, is treated as the first headline, thus :exclude-element "headline" affects its sub-headlines; this means that the content of the first headline is transcluded even when with "headline" in the list of excluded elements.

** 0.1.2
- e08df47 * add: live-sync for non-Org text file ::
  So far Non-Org text files could be transcluded but live-sync was not available. This version enables live-sync for them. Only for the whole file at the moment (ability to specify parts of a text file is considered)

- a576b34 * add: text-clone library (rename) ::
  Live-sync features are now factored out into =text-clone= as a standalone library (available with =text-clone.el= also included in this repo). Refactored so that  =org-transclusion= uses (and requires)  =text-clone=.

** 0.1.1
- 49f03b1 * feat: current-indentation ::
  Org-transclusion now keeps the original indentation of the keyword. When a transclusion text region is removed, its keyword will be indented as it was

- d55fc39 * chg: save-buffer hooks ::
  Instead of blindly deactivate and activate all transclusions with t flag, this variable is meant to provide mechanism to deactivate/activate only the transclusions currently in effect to copy a text content.

- 64fd182 * add: remove live-sync overlays when deleted ::
  Closes issue [[https://github.com/nobiot/org-transclusion/issues/8][#8]]  Adding a mechanism to remove both of the live-sync overlays (transclusion and source) when transclusion is completely deleted. This solves the problem of a source overlay to be orphaned in such cases.

** 0.1.0
As described in this version.
