;; It is an extension of text-clone functions written as part of GNU Emacs in
;; subr.el.  The first adaption to extend text-clone functions to work across
;; buffers was published in StackExchange by the user named Tobias in March
;; 2020. It can be found at https://emacs.stackexchange.com/questions/56201/
;; is-there-an-emacs-package-which-can-mirror-a-region/56202#56202

;; Noboru Ota has made further adaptions for version 0.0.1 in order for it
;; to work with the Org-transclusion package.

;;; Code:

;;;; Variables

(defvar text-clone-overlays nil
  "Global variable to keep track of all the text-clone.
overlays.  Used primarily by `text-clone-delete-overlays'.")

(defvar text-clone-live-sync-in-progress nil
  "Global variable used by `text-clone-live-sync' function.")

;;;; Functions

(defun text-clone-make-overlay (beg end &optional buf)
  "Wrapper for `make-ovelay' to standardize the parameters passed to it.
BEG and END can be point or marker.  Optionally BUF can be
passed.  FRONT-ADVANCE is nil, and REAR-ADVANCE is t."
  (make-overlay beg end buf nil t))

(defun text-clone-set-overlays (&rest overlays)
  "Add text-clone properties to OVERLAYS.
This function directly modifies the OVERLAYS passed and returns
modified OVERLAYS as a list in the same order as passed to it.
No copy is produced.

This function also refreshes `text-clone-overlays' as a
side-effect to keep track of the current text-clone overlays,
which is primarily used to clean up text-clone overlays with
`text-clone-delete-overlays'.

This function does not explicitly differentiate overlays for the
original text region and its clones.  Where such distinction is
important, use the sequence of OVERLAYS list; for example, the
first element of the list can be the overlay for the original and
rest, clones.

As this function returns modified overlays, a calling function
can further modify them.  For instance, you can put different
faces to visually differentiate them."

This function checks `text-clone-overlays' for overlays being
tracked.  Return nil if there is no overlay in it.

As side-effects, this function also does the following to clean
up text-clone:

- Remove the local `post-command-hook'
  `text-clone-post-command-h' for text-clone each overlay

- Reset tracking of text-clone overlays by setting
  `text-clone-overlays' to nil"

This is used on the `modification-hooks' property of text clones.
AFTER, BEG, and END are the fixed args for `modification-hooks'
and friends in an overlay.

It's a simplified version of the original `text-clone--maintain'.
This function does not use SPREADP or SYNTAX (both defined in
`text-clone-create').

Overlay is also assumed to be always SPREADP but insteaf we opt
for (nil t) -- refer to `text-clone-make-overlay'.  This enables
tighter overlay size and has `post-command-hook' to deal with the
case when one of the overlays is deleted (refer to
`text-clone-post-command-h').

This function also works during undo in progress; that is, when
`undo-in-progress' is non-nil."
