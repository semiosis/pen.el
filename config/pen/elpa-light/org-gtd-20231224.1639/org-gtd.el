;;; Commentary:

;; This package tries to replicate as closely as possible the GTD workflow.
;; This package assumes familiarity with GTD.
;;
;; This package provides a system that allows you to capture incoming things
;; into an inbox, then process the inbox and categorize each item based on the
;; GTD categories.  It leverages org-agenda to show today's items as well as the
;; NEXT items.  It also has a simple project management system, which currently
;; assumes all tasks in a project are sequential.
;;
;; For a comprehensive instruction manual, see the documentation.
;; Either the info file or in the doc/ directory of the repository.
;; Upgrade information is also available therein.

  "Set this to the latest version you have upgraded to.

You will only see warnings relevant to upgrade steps you must take to go up from
your version to the one installed.  Use a version string.  For instance:

If org-gtd is 2.0.0, use \"2.0.0\".
If org-gtd is 2.3.5, use \"2.3.5\".")

|-------------------------|
| WARNING: MAJOR VERSION  |
|-------------------------|

See the changelog for a full set of changes.

See the documentation for complete upgrade information:

=> `C-h i m org gtd RET'

Important notices involve:
- run `org-gtd-upgrade-v2-to-v3'
- this moves all your habits to a new sub-heading in the default org-gtd file
- it will create this file if you don't have it
- as long you respect the Habits structure, move them where you want

- some of the key commands have changed, e.g.
- `org-gtd-choose' is now `org-gtd-organize'
- `org-gtd-process-item-hooks' is now `org-gtd-organize-hooks'

So do review this, and join the discord in the readme if you want to meet
more users!

To make this warning go away, add the following setting to your config file
(BEFORE ORG-GTD LOADS)

(setq org-gtd-update-ack \"3.0.0\"

"))

(if (version< org-gtd-update-ack "2.1.0")
    (lwarn 'org-gtd :warning "

|--------------------------|
| WARNING: action required |
|--------------------------|

Upgrading to 2.1.0 requires changing the org-edna triggers for the project
categories. Failure to do so means your projects will end up in inconsistent
states.

See the documentation for instructions to upgrade (C-h i, then find org-gtd),
then add the following setting to your config file (BEFORE ORG-GTD LOADS)
to disable this warning.

(setq org-gtd-update-ack \"2.1.0\")

"))
