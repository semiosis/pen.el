This is a list of functions that modify an org element.  The default value has
one function: setting org tags on the item.  Some built-in examples are
provided as options here.  You can create your own functions to further organize
the items once they have been processed and add them to that list.

Once you have your ground items managed, you might like to set the variable
`org-gtd-areas-of-focus' and add `org-gtd-set-area-of-focus' to these hooks."
