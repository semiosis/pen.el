;;;; Requirements

(require 'f)
(require 'org-archive)
(require 'org-element)

(require 'org-gtd-core)
(require 'org-gtd-agenda)

;;;; Customization

(defgroup org-gtd-archive nil

  :package-version '(org-gtd . "3.0.0"))

(defcustom org-gtd-archive-location #'org-gtd-archive-location-func
  "Function to generate archive location for org gtd.

That is to say, when items get cleaned up from the active files, they will go
to whatever file/tree is generated by this function.  See `org-archive-location'
to learn more about the valid values generated.  Note that this will only be
the file used by the standard `org-archive' functions if you
enable command `org-gtd-mode'.  If not, this will be used only by
org-gtd's archive behavior.

This function has an arity of zero.  By default this generates a file
called gtd_archive_<currentyear> in `org-gtd-directory' and puts the entries
into a datetree."
