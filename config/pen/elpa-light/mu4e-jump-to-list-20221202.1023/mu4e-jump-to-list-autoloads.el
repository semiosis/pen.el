Jump interactively to an existing LISTID.
Prompt interactively for a listid to be displayed according to existing
List-ID headers in your mu database. The IDs are displayed in
recency order, with lists having newer messages first.

Lists eligible for selection can be restricted first using
`mu4e-jump-to-list-prefilter' and `mu4e-jump-to-list-kill-regexp'. Only
lists containing at least `mu4e-jump-to-list-min-freq' messages are
displayed. `mu4e-jump-to-list-filter' is finally used to limit messages
when a List-ID has been selected.
