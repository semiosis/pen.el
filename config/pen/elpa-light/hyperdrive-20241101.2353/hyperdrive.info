Hyperdrive.el User Manual
*************************

Hyperdrive (https://docs.holepunch.to/building-blocks/hyperdrive) is a
P2P, real-time, local-first, versioned filesystem designed for easy
peer-to-peer file sharing.  ‘hyperdrive.el’ is an independent project
built by USHIN (https://ushin.org) which provides an Emacs interface for
managing hyperdrives.

   ‘hyperdrive.el’ is in early development.  If something breaks, please
see *note Troubleshooting::.

2.1 Install Emacs
=================

‘hyperdrive.el’ requires GNU Emacs (https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/)
version 28.1 or later.


File: hyperdrive.info,  Node: Install curl,  Next: Install hyperdriveel,  Prev: Install Emacs,  Up: Installation

2.2 Install curl
================

‘hyperdrive.el’ requires a reasonably up-to-date version of curl
(https://curl.se/download.html).

   Feel free to skip this step.  ‘curl’ may already installed on your
machine, and ‘hyperdrive.el’ will warn you otherwise.


File: hyperdrive.info,  Node: Install hyperdriveel,  Next: Install hyper-gateway-ushin,  Prev: Install curl,  Up: Installation

2.3 Install hyperdrive.el
=========================

‘hyperdrive.el’ can be installed from NonGNU ELPA
(https://elpa.nongnu.org/nongnu/hyperdrive.html) with ‘M-x
package-refresh-contents’ then ‘M-x package-install RET hyperdrive’.

   After installing with NonGNU ELPA, you can later upgrade to a newer
version of ‘hyperdrive.el’ by running ‘M-x package-refresh-contents’
then ‘M-x package-upgrade RET hyperdrive’.  On Emacs 28, If
‘package-upgrade’ is not available as a command, display the list of
packages with ‘M-x list-packages’, select ‘hyperdrive’, and click the
‘Install’ button.


File: hyperdrive.info,  Node: Install hyper-gateway-ushin,  Prev: Install hyperdriveel,  Up: Installation

2.4 Install hyper-gateway-ushin
===============================

‘hyperdrive.el’ relies on hyper-gateway-ushin
(https://git.sr.ht/~ushin/hyper-gateway-ushin/) for talking to the
hypercore network.

   After installing ‘hyperdrive.el’ (see *note Install hyperdrive.el:
Install hyperdriveel.), run ‘M-x hyperdrive-install’ to download and
install the gateway.

4.2 Menu bar support
====================

If you enable ‘hyperdrive-menu-bar-mode’, either in your configuration
(see *note Example configuration::) or with ‘M-x
hyperdrive-menu-bar-mode’, the “Hyperdrive” menu should appear after the
“Tools” menu at the top of the screen.  If you don’t see the menu bar,
please double check that ‘menu-bar-mode’ is enabled (it is enabled by
default).

 -- Command: hyperdrive-menu-bar-mode
     Enable the “Hyperdrive” menu bar.

   If you have disabled ‘menu-bar-mode’, you can still use the
hyperdrive menu bar by pressing ‘C-mouse-3’ in a hyperdrive file or
directory.


File: hyperdrive.info,  Node: Hyperdrive menu command,  Next: Start/stop the gateway,  Prev: Menu bar support,  Up: Usage

4.3 Hyperdrive menu command
===========================

‘M-x hyperdrive-menu’ is a keyboard-driven interface to many
‘hyperdrive.el’ commands.  With the menu open, press one of highlit keys
or key combinations to invoke the command displayed next to it.
Different commands are available in ‘hyperdrive-menu’ when you’re inside
a hyperdrive file, directory, or neither.

   While inside the ‘hyperdrive-menu’, press ‘?’ twice to open this
‘hyperdrive.el’ info manual.  You can also press ‘?’ followed by a
command’s key sequence to get help for that command.  (*note more tips
on getting help: Quick documentation access.)

   If you press ‘C-u’ (universal prefix argument) before a key sequence,
the command may behave differently, e.g., by prompting for more
information.  You can jump between ‘hyperdrive-menu’ commands with the
‘up’ and ‘down’ arrow keys.  Press ‘C-g’ to close the menu.

 -- Command: hyperdrive-menu
     Show the hyperdrive menu interface.

   For more on this type of user interface, please refer to the *note
Transient documentation: (transient)Introduction.  To learn about the
commands available in ‘hyperdrive-menu’, read on!


File: hyperdrive.info,  Node: Start/stop the gateway,  Next: Open a hyperdrive,  Prev: Hyperdrive menu command,  Up: Usage

4.4 Start/stop the gateway
==========================

To connect with peers, you’ll need to start the gateway (see *note
hyper-gateway-ushin::).  The current running status of the gateway can
be seen in ‘hyperdrive-menu’ (see *note Hyperdrive menu command::) and
in the “Hyperdrive” menu bar (see *note Menu bar support::).

 -- Command: hyperdrive-start
     Start the gateway.

 -- User Option: hyperdrive-gateway-ready-hook
     Hook run when the gateway becomes responsive after
     ‘hyperdrive-start’.  One of the default hooks,
     ‘hyperdrive-check-gateway-version’, will warn you if you’re running
     an outdated version of the gateway.

 -- Command: hyperdrive-stop
     Stop the gateway.

 -- User Option: hyperdrive-gateway-dead-hook
     Hook run when the gateway is no longer live after
     ‘hyperdrive-stop’.

 -- Command: hyperdrive-restart
     Restart the gateway.

 -- Command: hyperdrive-gateway-version
     Say the version of the gateway which is running.

* Menu:

* Advanced gateway customization::


File: hyperdrive.info,  Node: Advanced gateway customization,  Up: Start/stop the gateway

4.4.1 Advanced gateway customization
------------------------------------

 -- User Option: hyperdrive-gateway-start-function
     Function run to start the gateway.  By default, ‘hyperdrive.el’
     will start the gateway as an Emacs subprocess.

 -- User Option: hyperdrive-gateway-stop-function
     Function run to stop the gateway.

 -- User Option: hyperdrive-gateway-live-predicate
     Function run to check that the gateway process is live.


File: hyperdrive.info,  Node: Open a hyperdrive,  Next: Create a hyperdrive,  Prev: Start/stop the gateway,  Up: Usage

4.5 Open a hyperdrive
=====================

You can open a hyperdrive folder or file by pasting in a ‘hyper://’ URL
after ‘M-x hyperdrive-open-url’.  Try loading USHIN’s hyperdrive:

     hyper://aaj45d88g4eenu76rpmwzjiabsof1w8u6fufq6oogyhjk1ubygxy/

 -- Command: hyperdrive-open-url
     Open a hyperdrive file or directory by its ‘hyper://’ URL.

   The following commands let you select and visit one of the
hyperdrives you’ve already created or visited:

 -- Command: hyperdrive-find-file
     Open a hyperdrive file or directory by choosing one of your known
     hyperdrives and a path inside it.  Like ‘find-file’, this command
     can be used to create a new file inside your own hyperdrives.

 -- Command: hyperdrive-view-file
     Like ‘hyperdrive-find-file’, but open the file in *note view-mode:
     (emacs)View Mode.

* Menu:

* Directory view::
* File view::
* Unknown paths::


File: hyperdrive.info,  Node: Directory view,  Next: File view,  Up: Open a hyperdrive

4.5.1 Directory view
--------------------

‘hyperdrive.el’ offers a Dired-like (see *note (emacs)Dired::) interface
for exploring hyperdrive directories.  In the directory view, the file
size color indicates how much of a file you have already downloaded:

green
     fully downloaded (‘hyperdrive-size-fully-downloaded’)
yellow
     partially downloaded (‘hyperdrive-size-partially-downloaded’)
red
     not downloaded (‘hyperdrive-size-not-downloaded’)

   Mouse over the file size to see exactly how many blocks make up the
file and how many of them you have downloaded.

   The following bindings are available in the directory view by
default:

‘n’ (‘hyperdrive-ewoc-next’)
‘p’ (‘hyperdrive-ewoc-previous’)
     Move between entries.

‘<RET>’ (‘hyperdrive-dir-find-file’)
     Open the file or directory at point.

‘o’ (‘hyperdrive-dir-find-file-other-window’)
‘<mouse-1>’
‘<mouse-2>’
     Open the file or directory at point in a new window.

‘v’ (‘hyperdrive-dir-view-file’)
     Open the file or directory at point in *note view-mode: (emacs)View
     Mode.

‘^’ (‘hyperdrive-up’)
     Go up to the parent directory.

‘g’ (‘revert-buffer’)
     Refresh the directory to display potential updates.

‘s’ (‘hyperdrive-dir-sort’)
     Sort directory contents by the current column.  To sort by a
     different column, click on the column header or use the universal
     prefix argument (‘C-u s’).

‘d’ (‘hyperdrive-dir-download-file’)
     Download the file at point to disk.

‘D’ (‘hyperdrive-delete’)
     Delete the file or directory (recursively) at point.

‘F’ (‘hyperdrive-forget-file’)
     Delete your local copy of the file at point.

‘H’ (‘hyperdrive-dir-history’)
     Open the version history (see *note View the hyperdrive version
     history::) of file at point.

‘w’ (‘hyperdrive-dir-copy-url’)
     Copy the URL of the file or directory at point.

‘j’ (‘imenu’)
     Open ‘imenu’ to quickly jump to a file in the current directory.

‘?’ (‘hyperdrive-menu’)
     Open ‘hyperdrive-menu’ (see *note Hyperdrive menu command::).

‘+’ (‘hyperdrive-create-directory-no-op’)
     This command signals an error, because you cannot create empty
     directories (see *note No empty directories::).

   You can customize the directory view with the following options:

 -- User Option: hyperdrive-directory-display-buffer-action
     Display buffer action for hyperdrive directories.  Passed to
     ‘display-buffer’, which see.

 -- User Option: hyperdrive-directory-sort
     Column by which directory entries are sorted by default.
     Internally, a cons cell of (COLUMN .  DIRECTION), the COLUMN being
     one of the directory listing columns (‘name’, ‘size’, or ‘mtime’)
     and DIRECTION being one of ‘:ascending’ or ‘:descending’.


File: hyperdrive.info,  Node: File view,  Next: Unknown paths,  Prev: Directory view,  Up: Open a hyperdrive

4.5.2 File view
---------------

The following keybindings are available inside the file view by default:

‘C-x x g’ (‘hyperdrive-revert-buffer-quick’)
     Refresh the file to display potential updates.  This command remaps
     the global ‘revert-buffer-quick’ keybinding.

‘C-x C-j’ (‘hyperdrive-up’)
     Jump to the parent hyperdrive directory from a hyperdrive file or
     directory buffer.  This command remaps the global ‘dired-jump’
     keybinding.

   For security reasons, ‘hyperdrive.el’ does not enable major modes
based on file extension unless the hyperdrive has been marked as “safe”
with ‘M-x hyperdrive-mark-as-safe’ (see *note Mark a hyperdrive as
safe::).

   The following customization options affect how files are displayed:

 -- User Option: hyperdrive-render-html
     Control how HTML hyperdrive files are displayed.  By default, HTML
     pages are rendered in Emacs with *note EWW: (eww)Top.  If ‘nil’,
     raw HTML will be displayed.


File: hyperdrive.info,  Node: Unknown paths,  Prev: File view,  Up: Open a hyperdrive

4.5.3 Unknown paths
-------------------

When you attempt to load a file or folder that doesn’t appear to exist,
‘hyperdrive.el’ will prompt you to take action:

   • ‘h’ (history) to open the *note version history: View the
     hyperdrive version history. for that file.
   • ‘u’ (up) to open the parent directory containing that file or
     folder
   • ‘r’ (recurse) to go up the directory tree until a directory is
     found or until you get to the root directory.
   • ‘e’ (explain) to open this section of the hyperdrive Info manual.
   • ‘q’ (exit) to exit,
   • ‘?’ (help) to show a help message.

   If you attempt to load the root directory (‘hyper://PUBLIC-KEY/’) of
a hyperdrive with a valid-looking public key which you’ve never loaded
before and for which no peers are currently found, ‘hyperdrive.el’
should warn you that no peers were found for that drive.  This might
mean that the drive doesn’t exist or just that you’re not connected to
anyone who knows about it.

   If you attempt to load a file or directory for a hyperdrive with a
malformed public key, ‘hyperdrive.el’ should ask you to double-check the
URL.


File: hyperdrive.info,  Node: Create a hyperdrive,  Next: Write to a hyperdrive,  Prev: Open a hyperdrive,  Up: Usage

4.6 Create a hyperdrive
=======================

You can have multiple hyperdrives, each one containing its own set of
files.  Run ‘M-x hyperdrive-new’ then type in a ‘seed’ (see *note
Seeds::) to create a new hyperdrive.  That seed will be combined with
your secret master key (see *note Master key::) to produce a public key
(see *note Public keys::) that uniquely identifies that hyperdrive.

 -- Command: hyperdrive-new
     Create a new hyperdrive from a seed string.

   When you create a new drive, your chosen seed is used as its petname
(see *note Petnames::) by default.


File: hyperdrive.info,  Node: Write to a hyperdrive,  Next: Link to a hyperdrive,  Prev: Create a hyperdrive,  Up: Usage

4.7 Write to a hyperdrive
=========================

After modifying a file in one of your hyperdrives, ‘save-buffer’ will
silently update the current hyperdrive file with the new content.

‘C-x C-s’ (‘save-buffer’)
     Save the current hyperdrive file buffer to its location.

‘C-x s’ (‘save-some-buffers’)
     Save all modified hyperdrive file buffers to their locations.  This
     command’s primary purpose is to save normal file buffers, and
     ‘hyperdrive.el’ has integrated with it.

     ‘hyperdrive.el’ will prompt to save modified hyperdrive files
     before exiting Emacs.  If you want the command ‘save-some-buffers’
     to always prompt to save hyperdrive files in addition to regular
     files, set ‘save-some-buffers-default-predicate’ to ‘t’.

 -- Command: hyperdrive-write-buffer
     Write the current buffer to a hyperdrive by choosing one of
     hyperdrives you have created as well as the path in that hyperdrive
     where you want to store the file.


File: hyperdrive.info,  Node: Link to a hyperdrive,  Next: Delete a hyperdrive file,  Prev: Write to a hyperdrive,  Up: Usage

4.8 Link to a hyperdrive
========================

You can share a hyperdrive file with someone by copying and sending its
link.  Anyone who has the link to a hyperdrive file or directory can
load it and view its contents.

 -- Command: hyperdrive-copy-url
     Copy the URL of the current hyperdrive file or directory.

   In the directory view, you can copy the URL of the file or directory
at point by pressing ‘w’ (see *note Directory view::).

* Menu:

* Org mode links::
* Markdown links::


File: hyperdrive.info,  Node: Org mode links,  Next: Markdown links,  Up: Link to a hyperdrive

4.8.1 Org mode links
--------------------

If the current file is an org-mode file, ‘org-store-link’ will store a
link to the hyperdrive file.  If point is inside a heading, a
URL-encoded search option containing its ‘CUSTOM_ID’, ‘ID’, or heading
text will be appended as the stored URL’s link fragment.

   Linking by path alone to other files within the same hyperdrive is
supported; within ‘hyper://PUBLIC-KEY/foo.org’, links to ‘bar.org’,
‘./bar.org’, and ‘/bar.org’ will all point to
‘hyper://PUBLIC-KEY/bar.org’.  Links within a hyperdrive may also begin
with the explicit ‘file:’ prefix.  A version number can also be
specified; ‘/$/version/42/bar.org’ will point to
‘hyper://PUBLIC-KEY/$/version/42/bar.org’.

   Org-mode hyperdrive link completion allows you to interactively link
to a hyperdrive file/folder by running ‘M-x org-insert-link’ (or ‘C-c
C-l’ in org-mode), then typing ‘hyper:’ and ‘RET’.  To change how
‘org-insert-link’ inserts links to files within the same hyperdrive,
adjust ‘hyperdrive-org-link-full-url’ and ‘org-link-file-path-type’.

 -- User Option: hyperdrive-org-link-full-url
     This option controls whether relative links to hyperdrives are ever
     inserted with ‘org-insert-link’.  Set it to ‘t’ if you always want
     to insert full ‘hyper://’ links.


File: hyperdrive.info,  Node: Markdown links,  Prev: Org mode links,  Up: Link to a hyperdrive

4.8.2 Markdown links
--------------------

Relative links are supported; within ‘hyper://PUBLIC-KEY/foo.md’, the
links ‘[bar](<bar.md>)’, ‘[bar](<./bar.md>)’, and ‘[bar](</bar.md>)’ all
point to ‘hyper://PUBLIC-KEY/bar.md’.


File: hyperdrive.info,  Node: Delete a hyperdrive file,  Next: Forget a hyperdrive file,  Prev: Link to a hyperdrive,  Up: Usage

4.9 Delete a hyperdrive file
============================

*Please note that deleted files can be accessed by loading a prior
version of the hyperdrive (see *note View the hyperdrive version
history::).*

 -- Command: hyperdrive-delete
     Delete the hyperdrive file in the current buffer.

   This command also has a keybinding in the directory view (see *note
Directory view::).


File: hyperdrive.info,  Node: Forget a hyperdrive file,  Next: View the hyperdrive version history,  Prev: Delete a hyperdrive file,  Up: Usage

4.10 Forget a hyperdrive file
=============================

*Please note that forgetting a file may result in data loss if it cannot
be loaded from another peer on the network.*

   It is possible to “forget” your local copy of a hyperdrive file in
order to save disk space.  “Forgetting” a file does not delete the file
from the hyperdrive and does not increment the hyperdrive’s version
number.

 -- Command: hyperdrive-forget-file
     Delete your local copy of the file for the current buffer.

   This command also has a keybinding in the directory view (see *note
Directory view::).  When you forget a file, the file size of its
directory listing will turn red, indicating that you no longer have a
copy of the file.


File: hyperdrive.info,  Node: View the hyperdrive version history,  Next: Describe a hyperdrive,  Prev: Forget a hyperdrive file,  Up: Usage

4.11 View the hyperdrive version history
========================================

Hyperdrives are versioned, meaning that you can explore the history of
changes made to hyperdrive files (see *note Versioning::).

 -- Command: hyperdrive-open-previous-version
     Open the previous version of the current hyperdrive file or
     directory.

 -- Command: hyperdrive-open-previous-version
     Open the next version of the current hyperdrive file or directory.

 -- Command: hyperdrive-open-at-version
     Open the current hyperdrive file or directory at a specific version
     number.  To open the file or directory at its hyperdrive’s latest
     version, leave the version blank.

   The following keybindings are available when visiting an old version
of a hyperdrive file (‘hyperdrive-blob-mode’):

‘n’ (‘hyperdrive-open-next-version’)
‘p’ (‘hyperdrive-open-previous-version’)
     Traverse version history for the current file.

‘q’ (‘kill-current-buffer’)

* Menu:

* History buffer::


File: hyperdrive.info,  Node: History buffer,  Up: View the hyperdrive version history

4.11.1 History buffer
---------------------

The history buffer displays the entire known history of a hyperdrive
file.  For an explanation of how it works, see *note Partial version
data::.

   Like in the *note directory view: Directory view, the file size color
in the history view indicates how much of a file you have already
downloaded.

 -- Command: hyperdrive-history
     Open the history buffer for the current hyperdrive file.  To open
     the history for a different file, use the universal prefix argument
     like this: ‘C-u M-x hyperdrive-history’.

   The following keybindings are available inside the history view by
default:

‘n’ (‘hyperdrive-ewoc-next’)
‘p’ (‘hyperdrive-ewoc-previous’)
     Move between entries.

‘+’ (‘hyperdrive-history-load’)
     Load all drive metadata, including version metadata, then reload
     the history buffer.

‘<RET>’ (‘hyperdrive-history-find-file’)
     Open the file at the start of the version range at point.  When the
     version range at point is ‘unknown’, run ‘hyperdrive-history-load’.

‘o’ (‘hyperdrive-history-find-file-other-window’)
‘<mouse-1>’
‘<mouse-2>’
     Open the file at the start of the version range at point in a new
     window.

‘v’ (‘hyperdrive-history-view-file’)

4.12 Describe a hyperdrive
==========================

To see information about a hyperdrive, such as its public key, seed,
petname, nickname, domains, writability, local disk usage, or other
metadata, run ‘hyperdrive-describe-hyperdrive’.  For more on what this
information means, see *note Naming::.

 -- Command: hyperdrive-describe-hyperdrive
     Display the description of the hyperdrive containing the current
     file or directory.  To describe a different hyperdrive, use the
     universal prefix argument: ‘C-u M-x
     hyperdrive-describe-hyperdrive’.

4.13 Name a hyperdrive
======================

‘hyperdrive.el’ supports different ways to identify hyperdrives (see
*note Naming::).  The following commands can be used to name
hyperdrives:

 -- Command: hyperdrive-set-petname
     Set the petname (see *note Petnames::) of the hyperdrive for the
     current hyperdrive file or directory.  You can’t use the same
     petname for multiple hyperdrives.  To set the petname of a
     different hyperdrive, use the universal prefix argument: ‘C-u M-x
     hyperdrive-set-petname’.

 -- Command: hyperdrive-set-nickname
     Set the nickname (see *note Nicknames::) of the hyperdrive for the
     current hyperdrive file or directory.  You can only set the
     nickname for a hyperdrive which you previously created.  To set the
     nickname of a different hyperdrive, use the universal prefix
     argument like this: ‘C-u M-x hyperdrive-set-nickname’.

4.14 Bookmark a hyperdrive
==========================

You can use the built-in ‘bookmark-set’, ‘bookmark-jump’, and
‘bookmark-list’ functions to store and jump to a hyperdrive file or
directory.

 -- Command: hyperdrive-bookmark-jump
     Select a hyperdrive bookmark and jump to it.

4.15 Stream audio and video
===========================

When you use ‘hyperdrive-find-file’ or some other command to open a
streamable audio/video file, Emacs will use an external program to
stream that video from the network.  After the stream finishes, the
audio/video file is stored locally.

 -- User Option: hyperdrive-stream-player-command
     Command used to play streamable URLs externally.  Default uses mpv
     (https://mpv.io/).  There also exists a preconfigured option for
     VLC media player (https://www.videolan.org/vlc/).

4.16 Download hyperdrive files
==============================

You can “download” a hyperdrive file to your local filesystem, meaning
that ‘hyperdrive.el’ will (1) download the file from the network if it
hasn’t done so already and then (2) copy the file contents to a
file-path on your machine of your choosing.  The following commands may
be run while offline.

 -- Command: hyperdrive-download
     Download a hyperdrive file by selecting a hyperdrive and a path.

 -- Command: hyperdrive-download-url
     Download a hyperdrive file by pasting in a ‘hyper://’ URL.

 -- User Option: hyperdrive-download-directory
     Location where ‘hyperdrive-download-url’ will download files.
     Defaults to ‘eww-download-directory’ or, if not bound, the home
     directory.

4.17 Upload files from your filesystem
======================================

If you already have a file on your local filesystem that you’d like to
put on a hyperdrive, you can “upload” it.  Note that the following
commands add files to a hyperdrive, but those files are not
automatically “uploaded” to anyone else’s machine in the traditional
sense.  Files are only shared on the network when other peers request
them from your node.  The following commands may be run while offline.

 -- Command: hyperdrive-upload-file
     Upload a single file from your filesystem.  By default, the
     selected file will be placed in your hyperdrive’s root directory,
     but you can edit the filepath before uploading.

 -- Command: hyperdrive-upload-files
     Upload multiple files from your filesystem.  The selected files
     will be uploaded into the same target directory in your hyperdrive.

   On Emacs 29+, you can upload an image which you previously copied to
your clipboard from an external program with ‘M-x yank-media’.

* Menu:

* Mirror a whole directory::


File: hyperdrive.info,  Node: Mirror a whole directory,  Up: Upload files from your filesystem

4.17.1 Mirror a whole directory
-------------------------------

For uploading more than a few files, you can use ‘hyperdrive-mirror’.

 -- Command: hyperdrive-mirror
     Upload a directory, mirroring its subdirectory structure in your
     hyperdrive.  This command prompts for a source directory on your
     local filesystem from which to upload files as well as a hyperdrive
     and target directory inside of it where the files will end up.

     The source and target directories will be compared, and only the
     files which are “new locally” (they don’t already exist on the
     drive) or “newer locally” (they have been locally modified since a
     previous upload) will be uploaded.  Files which are the “same”
     (they have the same timestamp as in the drive) or are “older
     locally” (they have been modified on the drive more recently than
     on the filesystem) will not be uploaded.

     With a universal prefix argument (‘C-u M-x hyperdrive-mirror’), it
     additionally prompts for a filter argument to programmatically
     determine which files will be considered for upload.  With two
     universal prefix arguments (‘C-u C-u M-x hyperdrive-mirror’),
     matching files will be uploaded without the confirmation step.

   As a confirmation step, ‘hyperdrive-mirror’ displays each file to be
uploaded alongside the URL in the hyperdrive where it will end up.  The
following keybindings are available in ‘hyperdrive-mirror-mode’:

‘C-c C-c’ (‘hyperdrive-mirror-do-upload’)
     Upload all of the files in the “To Upload” section.

‘<TAB>’ (‘magit-section-toggle’)
     Fold or unfold the section at point.

4.18 Mark a hyperdrive as safe
==============================

For security reasons, ‘hyperdrive.el’ does not enable major modes based
on file extension unless the hyperdrive has been marked as “safe.” When
opening a file in a hyperdrive marked as “unknown” (the default),
‘hyperdrive.el’ will prompt you to mark the drive as “safe”, “unsafe”,
or “unknown”.  Files in hyperdrives which are marked as “safe” are
always opened in the appropriate major mode with ‘set-auto-mode’.  Files
in hyperdrives which are marked as “unsafe” are opened in
‘fundamental-mode’ (no major mode).

 -- Command: hyperdrive-mark-as-safe
     Mark a hyperdrive as “safe”, “unsafe”, or “unknown”.  This command
     can also be invoked from ‘hyperdrive-menu-hyperdrive’ and the menu
     bar.

4.19 Purge a hyperdrive
=======================

*Data which has been purged from your local machine may still be
available on the network.*

   *Data which has been purged from your local machine may not be
recoverable.*

 -- Command: hyperdrive-purge
     Remove all data related to a hyperdrive.  This command will prompt
     for confirmation before deleting anything.  In addition to the
     hyperdrive’s file content and metadata, ‘hyperdrive-purge’ also
     deletes relevant metadata persisted in the ‘hyperdrive-hyperdrives’
     variable.

4.20 Non-interactive use
========================

In writing your own functions to extend ‘hyperdrive.el’, you can use
‘hyperdrive-by-slot’ to access a hyperdrive by its metadata:

 -- Function: hyperdrive-by-slot
     This function accepts a hyperdrive seed, petname, or public key,
     and returns the hyperdrive ‘struct’.

File: hyperdrive.info,  Node: Non-interactive use example hyperdrive-mirror,  Up: Non-interactive use

4.20.1 Non-interactive use example: ‘hyperdrive-mirror’
-------------------------------------------------------

You can use the following snippet to recursively upload all of the files
from your local filesystem’s ‘~/blog/’ directory into the ‘/blog/’
directory of a hyperdrive you previously created with petname ‘"foo"’:

     (hyperdrive-mirror
      "~/blog/"
      (hyperdrive-by-slot 'petname "foo")
      "/blog/")

   To upload the same files without confirmation, add ‘:no-confirm t’.

   Now let’s say that you want to upload only those files tagged as
“public” using Protesilaos Stavrou’s Denote
(https://protesilaos.com/emacs/denote) file-naming scheme.  The
following snippet includes a ‘FILTER’ key whose value is a regular
expression against which every expanded filename will be tested.

     (hyperdrive-mirror
      "~/blog/"
      (hyperdrive-by-slot 'petname "foo")
      "/blog/"
      :filter "_public")

   Alternatively, you could select files by tag with Karl Voit’s
filetags (https://github.com/novoid/filetags/).  Either way allows for a
“non-splitting” approach where public and private files exist in the
same directory.

   ‘FILTER’ may also be a function, which receives the expanded filename
as its only argument.  For example, the following snippet will mirror
only those files in ‘~/blog/’ which are smaller than 5MB:

     (hyperdrive-mirror
      "~/blog/"
      (hyperdrive-by-slot 'petname "foo")
      "/blog/"
      :filter (lambda (file) (> (* 5 1024 1024)
                           (file-attribute-size
                            (file-attributes file)))))

5.1 Hyperdrive
==============

Hyperdrive (https://docs.holepunch.to/building-blocks/hyperdrive) is a
virtual filesystem which you can use to share files on the peer-to-peer
(P2P) ‘hyper’ network.  It’s a folder with a globally unique link
starting with ‘hyper://’ that you can put files into and other peers can
pull files out of (if they have the link).

   Anyone with the link to your hyperdrive can download its contents
directly from your computer.  There’s no need to make an account or rely
on a third party to pass the data along.  Anyone who has a copy of the
content in your hyperdrive can serve it to others.  This means that your
hyperdrive can circulate on the ‘hyper’ network even when you’re
offline.

   Hyperdrive is single-writer, meaning that you are the only one who
change a hyperdrive that you’ve created.  Files in a hyperdrive are
cryptographically signed to ensure that the files you share aren’t
tampered with.

   You can make as many hyperdrives as you like; the only limitation is
your own disk space.

   Hyperdrive is offline-first since you can view files which were
previously downloaded even when your machine is disconnected from the
rest of the network.  It’s also local-first, since you can connect with
peers on a local network even without an internet connection.

   Unlike BitTorrent, another P2P protocol for sharing files,
hyperdrives are mutable.  If you share a link to your hyperdrive and
then later add, update, or delete files inside it, peers will be able to
access your latest changes at the same link.  When you make revisions to
a hyperdrive, the old versions of your files can still be accessed by
peers on the network.  See *note Versioning:: for more information.

* Versioning::
* Master key::


File: hyperdrive.info,  Node: Sparse replication,  Next: Versioning,  Up: Hyperdrive

5.1.1 Sparse replication
------------------------

Hyperdrives are sparsely replicated, meaning that peers can download
particular files from a hyperdrive without having to download the whole
drive.  This reduces both load times and disk usage.


File: hyperdrive.info,  Node: Versioning,  Next: Master key,  Prev: Sparse replication,  Up: Hyperdrive

5.1.2 Versioning
----------------

Hyperdrives are versioned, meaning that it is possible to explore a
hyperdrive as it was in the past.  Version numbers indicate the
hyperdrive’s version.  For example, ‘hyper://PUBLIC-KEY/$/version/50/’
refers to the fiftieth version of the hyperdrive identified by
‘PUBLIC-KEY’.  If you want to load the latest version, leave out the
‘/$/version/N’ part.  For example, if you run...

     M-x hyperdrive-open-url RET hyper://PUBLIC-KEY/foo.org RET

   ...then ‘hyperdrive.el’ will attempt to find ‘/foo.org’ inside the
latest version of that hyperdrive.

   Whenever you add a file, remove a file, or change a file, the
hyperdrive’s version number gets incremented by 1.  The version number
tells you how many times the hyperdrive has been modified, not how many
times a particular file has been modified.  For example, let’s say that
the current version of your hyperdrive at ‘hyper://PUBLIC-KEY/’ is 50.
If you add a new file at ‘hyper://PUBLIC-KEY/bar.org’, the latest
version of your hyperdrive will become 51.

   Since ‘/bar.org’ did not exist before version 51, if you attempt to
load ‘hyper://PUBLIC-KEY/$/version/50/bar.org’, ‘hyperdrive.el’ should
warn you that nothing exists at that URL.  If you add another file at
‘hyper://PUBLIC-KEY/quux.org’, your hyperdrive’s latest version will
become 52.  For the moment, ‘hyper://PUBLIC-KEY/bar.org’,
‘hyper://PUBLIC-KEY/$/version/51/bar.org’, and
‘hyper://PUBLIC-KEY/$/version/52/bar.org’, all point to the same version
of ‘/bar.org’.  If you then make a change to ‘/bar.org’, your
hyperdrive’s latest version will become 53.  Now
‘hyper://PUBLIC-KEY/bar.org’ and
‘hyper://PUBLIC-KEY/$/version/53/bar.org’ will point to the latest
version of ‘/bar.org’, while the original version will be available at
version 51 or 52.

   Here’s the mockup of the history view for ‘/bar.org’ so far, the
hyperdrive’s latest version being 53:

Version range   exists
-------------------------
53              yes
51-52           yes
1-50            no

   The table shows that ‘/bar.org’ was created at version 51 and
modified at version 53.  The final version range number in the table is
53, indicating that the hyperdrive’s latest version is 53.

   If you delete ‘/bar.org’ then try to load
‘hyper://PUBLIC-KEY/bar.org’, ‘hyperdrive.el’ will open an empty buffer
for you to author a new file.  If another peer attempts to load that
URL, ‘hyperdrive.el’ will warn ‘"URL not found"’, since you are the only
one who can modify your drive.  All peers can view the old file contents
at the versioned URLs.

   Since only the current version of a hyperdrive file can be updated,
‘hyperdrive.el’ sets the buffer to read-only whenever a version number
is specified in a hyper URL.

5.1.2.1 Partial version data

Because hyperdrives are sparsely replicated (see *note Sparse
replication::), ‘hyperdrive.el’ might not know the full version history
of a file.  In the history view (see *note History buffer::), ranges of
the history which have not yet been downloaded from the network are
displayed as “unknown”.  You can run the ‘hyperdrive-history-load’
command to download the full history and reload the history buffer.

5.1.3 Master key

‘hyperdrive-new’.  Your master key is generated automatically by the
gateway.

5.2 hyper-gateway-ushin
=======================

Hyper-gateway-ushin (https://git.sr.ht/~ushin/hyper-gateway-ushin)
handles interactions with hyperdrive under the hood, and it runs a local
HTTP server which offers a Fetch API to access the Hyperdrive network.
In ‘hyperdrive.el’, P2P interactions consist mostly of, e.g., ‘GET’
requests to download files and ‘PUT’ requests to write files to a
hyperdrive.

5.3 Naming
==========

Inspired by Marc Stiegler’s An Introduction to Petname Systems
(http://www.skyhunter.com/marcs/petnames/IntroPetNames.html),
‘hyperdrive.el’ names drives in a three different ways:

Public key
     public, globally unique, not human-memorable
Nickname
     public, not necessarily unique, human-memorable
Petname
     private, locally unique, human-memorable

   If ‘hyperdrive.el’ is like a phonebook, then public keys are phone
numbers, nicknames are how your contacts introduce themselves, and
petnames are the names you actually write down.

   Each drive may also have one or both of the following attributes:

Seed
     string used to generate public key
DNS domain
     public, globally unique, human-memorable

File: hyperdrive.info,  Node: Public keys,  Next: Nicknames,  Up: Naming

5.3.1 Public keys
-----------------

Public keys are globally unique identifiers for hyperdrives.  They make
up the first part of a ‘hyper://’ URL.  Public keys are
52-character-long z-base-32
(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base32#z-base-32) encoded keys generated
from your master key (see *note Master key::) and a *note seed: Seeds.
string.  When you run ‘hyperdrive-new’ and type a new seed, the gateway
automatically generates a new public key.


File: hyperdrive.info,  Node: Nicknames,  Next: Petnames,  Prev: Public keys,  Up: Naming

5.3.2 Nicknames
---------------

Nicknames are public, memorable names which you can give to your own
hyperdrives to make them easier for others to recognize.  Other users
can see your nicknames but cannot change them.

   Nicknames are stored in each hyperdrive inside
‘/.well-known/host-meta.json’ under the ‘name’ key, as specified in
RFC6415 (https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6415#section-6.1).


File: hyperdrive.info,  Node: Petnames,  Next: Seeds,  Prev: Nicknames,  Up: Naming

5.3.3 Petnames
--------------

Petnames are locally unique hyperdrive identifiers.  You can give a
petname to any hyperdrive you load, whether you created it or not.


File: hyperdrive.info,  Node: Seeds,  Next: DNS domains,  Prev: Petnames,  Up: Naming

5.3.4 Seeds
-----------

Seeds are used in tandem with your secret master key (see *note Master
key::) to generate public keys (see *note Public keys::).  The same seed
and master key will always produce the same public key, so a
hyperdrive’s seed cannot be changed.  Seeds are local but not secret.
To share a drive, you must use a public key or DNS domain (see *note DNS
domains::).


File: hyperdrive.info,  Node: DNS domains,  Prev: Seeds,  Up: Naming

5.3.5 DNS domains
-----------------

It is possible to use DNSLink (https://dnslink.io/) to link to a
hyperdrive with a domain name instead of a public key (see *note Public
keys::), like ‘hyper://example.org/path/to/file’.  Create a TXT record
at ‘_dnslink.example.org’ with the contents ‘/hyper/PUBLIC-KEY’ (no
trailing slash).  Note: relying on DNS adds another point of
centralization, reducing the durability of your link.  ‘hyperdrive.el’
somewhat mitigates this issue by remembering which public key the DNS
record resolved to, so that peers can use the stored public key itself
for subsequent connections.

   DNS domains are checked for suspicious characters (see *note
(elisp)Suspicious Text::).

     string, used in ‘hyperdrive-default-entry-format’ and
     ‘hyperdrive-buffer-name-format’ as well as other places hyperdrives
     or entries are displayed.  By default, each metadatum is prefixed
     by its type, e.g., the petname ‘foo’ is displayed by default as
     ‘petname:foo’.

     Feel free to adjust the following example configuration for
     abbreviated labels:

          (setq hyperdrive-formats
                '((name . "%s")
                  (version . " (%s)")
                  (path . "%s")
                  (petname . "p:%s")
                  (nickname . "n:%s")
                  (public-key . "k:%s")
                  (short-key . "k:%.8s…")
                  (seed . "s:%s")
                  (domains . "d:%s")))

     With this snippet, the petname ‘foo’ now displays as ‘p:foo’.  For
     further customization, run ‘M-x customize-group RET
     hyperdrive-entry-format’.

6.1.1 Completion styles and cycling
-----------------------------------

‘hyperdrive.el’ offers a ‘completing-read’ interface for selecting a
hyperdrive from a list of known hyperdrive.  You can customize the
completion styles and cycling behavior by customizing the ‘hyperdrive’
category in ‘completion-category-overrides’.

File: hyperdrive.info,  Node: No empty directories,  Next: Files and folders can have the same name,  Up: Known limitations

7.1 No empty directories
========================

Instead of files and folders, Hyperdrive technically has entries and
entry prefixes.  In other words, folders don’t exist unless they contain
files.  This results in potentially unexpected behavior:

   • it is not possible to create empty directories
   • deleting the last file in a folder deletes the folder as well

   When a hyperdrive file or folder is not found, ‘hyperdrive.el’
prompts you for an action (see *note Unknown paths::).

7.2 Files and folders can have the same name
============================================

In the current implementation of Hyperdrive, it’s possible for an entry
(folder) and an entry prefix (folder) to have the same name, e.g.,
‘hyper://PUBLIC-KEY/foo/bar/’ and ‘hyper://PUBLIC-KEY/foo/bar’.  In this
case, the folder listing for ‘hyper://PUBLIC-KEY/foo/’ would display the
‘bar’ entry but not the ‘bar/’ entry prefix.

encoded.  If you use other encodings and you notice issues, please let

8.1 Quick documentation access
==============================

There are many ways to read this info manual within Emacs:

 -- Command: hyperdrive-info-manual
     Open the hyperdrive.el info manual.

   You can also open the ‘hyperdrive.el’ info manual from
‘hyperdrive-menu’ by pressing ‘?’ twice.

   To view documentation for particular ‘hyperdrive.el’ commands,
functions, and variables, press ‘C-h o’ (‘describe-symbol’).  Inside the
‘*Help*’ buffer that pops open, you can press ‘i’ (‘help-goto-info’) to
jump to the relevant section in the ‘hyperdrive.el’ manual.

*****************

If you have installed the gateway with ‘hyperdrive-install’, you can
delete the gateway which Emacs downloaded according to the values of
‘hyperdrive-gateway-directory’ and ‘hyperdrive-gateway-program’, which
is ‘~/.local/lib/hyperdrive.el/hyper-gateway-ushin’ by default.

   You can delete the user data which ‘hyper-gateway-ushin’ stores by
default in ‘~/.local/share/hyper-gateway-nodejs’.

   You can remove ‘hyperdrive.el’ with ‘M-x package-delete hyperdrive’.

14 GNU Free Documentation License
*********************************

                     Version 1.3, 3 November 2008

     Copyright © 2000, 2001, 2002, 2007, 2008 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
     <https://fsf.org/>

     Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
     of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

  0. PREAMBLE

     The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other
     functional and useful document “free” in the sense of freedom: to
     assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it,
     with or without modifying it, either commercially or
     noncommercially.  Secondarily, this License preserves for the
     author and publisher a way to get credit for their work, while not
     being considered responsible for modifications made by others.

     This License is a kind of “copyleft”, which means that derivative
     works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense.
     It complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft
     license designed for free software.

     We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for
     free software, because free software needs free documentation: a
     free program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms
     that the software does.  But this License is not limited to
     software manuals; it can be used for any textual work, regardless
     of subject matter or whether it is published as a printed book.  We
     recommend this License principally for works whose purpose is
     instruction or reference.

  1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS

     This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium,
     that contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can
     be distributed under the terms of this License.  Such a notice
     grants a world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration,
     to use that work under the conditions stated herein.  The
     “Document”, below, refers to any such manual or work.  Any member
     of the public is a licensee, and is addressed as “you”.  You accept
     the license if you copy, modify or distribute the work in a way
     requiring permission under copyright law.

     A “Modified Version” of the Document means any work containing the
     Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with
     modifications and/or translated into another language.

     A “Secondary Section” is a named appendix or a front-matter section
     of the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the
     publishers or authors of the Document to the Document’s overall
     subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could
     fall directly within that overall subject.  (Thus, if the Document
     is in part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not
     explain any mathematics.)  The relationship could be a matter of
     historical connection with the subject or with related matters, or
     of legal, commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position
     regarding them.

     The “Invariant Sections” are certain Secondary Sections whose
     titles are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the
     notice that says that the Document is released under this License.
     If a section does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it
     is not allowed to be designated as Invariant.  The Document may
     contain zero Invariant Sections.  If the Document does not identify
     any Invariant Sections then there are none.

     The “Cover Texts” are certain short passages of text that are
     listed, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice
     that says that the Document is released under this License.  A
     Front-Cover Text may be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may
     be at most 25 words.

     A “Transparent” copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
     represented in a format whose specification is available to the
     general public, that is suitable for revising the document
     straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed
     of pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely
     available drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text
     formatters or for automatic translation to a variety of formats
     suitable for input to text formatters.  A copy made in an otherwise
     Transparent file format whose markup, or absence of markup, has
     been arranged to thwart or discourage subsequent modification by
     readers is not Transparent.  An image format is not Transparent if
     used for any substantial amount of text.  A copy that is not
     “Transparent” is called “Opaque”.

     Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
     ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format,
     SGML or XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming
     simple HTML, PostScript or PDF designed for human modification.
     Examples of transparent image formats include PNG, XCF and JPG.
     Opaque formats include proprietary formats that can be read and
     edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which
     the DTD and/or processing tools are not generally available, and
     the machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF produced by some word
     processors for output purposes only.

     The “Title Page” means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
     plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the
     material this License requires to appear in the title page.  For
     works in formats which do not have any title page as such, “Title
     Page” means the text near the most prominent appearance of the
     work’s title, preceding the beginning of the body of the text.

     The “publisher” means any person or entity that distributes copies
     of the Document to the public.

     A section “Entitled XYZ” means a named subunit of the Document
     whose title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses
     following text that translates XYZ in another language.  (Here XYZ
     stands for a specific section name mentioned below, such as
     “Acknowledgements”, “Dedications”, “Endorsements”, or “History”.)
     To “Preserve the Title” of such a section when you modify the
     Document means that it remains a section “Entitled XYZ” according
     to this definition.

     The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice
     which states that this License applies to the Document.  These
     Warranty Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in
     this License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other
     implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and
     has no effect on the meaning of this License.

  2. VERBATIM COPYING

     You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
     commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
     copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License
     applies to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you
     add no other conditions whatsoever to those of this License.  You
     may not use technical measures to obstruct or control the reading
     or further copying of the copies you make or distribute.  However,
     you may accept compensation in exchange for copies.  If you
     distribute a large enough number of copies you must also follow the
     conditions in section 3.

     You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above,
     and you may publicly display copies.

  3. COPYING IN QUANTITY

     If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly
     have printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and
     the Document’s license notice requires Cover Texts, you must
     enclose the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all
     these Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and
     Back-Cover Texts on the back cover.  Both covers must also clearly
     and legibly identify you as the publisher of these copies.  The
     front cover must present the full title with all words of the title
     equally prominent and visible.  You may add other material on the
     covers in addition.  Copying with changes limited to the covers, as
     long as they preserve the title of the Document and satisfy these
     conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in other respects.

     If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
     legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
     reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto
     adjacent pages.

     If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document
     numbering more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable
     Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with
     each Opaque copy a computer-network location from which the general
     network-using public has access to download using public-standard
     network protocols a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free
     of added material.  If you use the latter option, you must take
     reasonably prudent steps, when you begin distribution of Opaque
     copies in quantity, to ensure that this Transparent copy will
     remain thus accessible at the stated location until at least one
     year after the last time you distribute an Opaque copy (directly or
     through your agents or retailers) of that edition to the public.

     It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of
     the Document well before redistributing any large number of copies,
     to give them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the
     Document.

  4. MODIFICATIONS

     You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document
     under the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you
     release the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the
     Modified Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing
     distribution and modification of the Modified Version to whoever
     possesses a copy of it.  In addition, you must do these things in
     the Modified Version:

       A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title
          distinct from that of the Document, and from those of previous
          versions (which should, if there were any, be listed in the
          History section of the Document).  You may use the same title
          as a previous version if the original publisher of that
          version gives permission.

       B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or
          entities responsible for authorship of the modifications in
          the Modified Version, together with at least five of the
          principal authors of the Document (all of its principal
          authors, if it has fewer than five), unless they release you
          from this requirement.

       C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the
          Modified Version, as the publisher.

       D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.

       E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications
          adjacent to the other copyright notices.

       F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license
          notice giving the public permission to use the Modified
          Version under the terms of this License, in the form shown in
          the Addendum below.

       G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant
          Sections and required Cover Texts given in the Document’s
          license notice.

       H. Include an unaltered copy of this License.

       I. Preserve the section Entitled “History”, Preserve its Title,
          and add to it an item stating at least the title, year, new
          authors, and publisher of the Modified Version as given on the
          Title Page.  If there is no section Entitled “History” in the
          Document, create one stating the title, year, authors, and
          publisher of the Document as given on its Title Page, then add
          an item describing the Modified Version as stated in the
          previous sentence.

       J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document
          for public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and
          likewise the network locations given in the Document for
          previous versions it was based on.  These may be placed in the
          “History” section.  You may omit a network location for a work
          that was published at least four years before the Document
          itself, or if the original publisher of the version it refers
          to gives permission.

       K. For any section Entitled “Acknowledgements” or “Dedications”,
          Preserve the Title of the section, and preserve in the section
          all the substance and tone of each of the contributor
          acknowledgements and/or dedications given therein.

       L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document, unaltered
          in their text and in their titles.  Section numbers or the
          equivalent are not considered part of the section titles.

       M. Delete any section Entitled “Endorsements”.  Such a section
          may not be included in the Modified Version.

       N. Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled
          “Endorsements” or to conflict in title with any Invariant
          Section.

       O. Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.

     If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
     appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no
     material copied from the Document, you may at your option designate
     some or all of these sections as invariant.  To do this, add their
     titles to the list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version’s
     license notice.  These titles must be distinct from any other
     section titles.

     You may add a section Entitled “Endorsements”, provided it contains
     nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various
     parties—for example, statements of peer review or that the text has
     been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of
     a standard.

     You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text,
     and a passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of
     the list of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one passage
     of Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or
     through arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the Document
     already includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added
     by you or by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on
     behalf of, you may not add another; but you may replace the old
     one, on explicit permission from the previous publisher that added
     the old one.

     The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this
     License give permission to use their names for publicity for or to
     assert or imply endorsement of any Modified Version.

  5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS

     You may combine the Document with other documents released under
     this License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for
     modified versions, provided that you include in the combination all
     of the Invariant Sections of all of the original documents,
     unmodified, and list them all as Invariant Sections of your
     combined work in its license notice, and that you preserve all
     their Warranty Disclaimers.

     The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
     multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single
     copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name
     but different contents, make the title of each such section unique
     by adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the
     original author or publisher of that section if known, or else a
     unique number.  Make the same adjustment to the section titles in
     the list of Invariant Sections in the license notice of the
     combined work.

     In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled
     “History” in the various original documents, forming one section
     Entitled “History”; likewise combine any sections Entitled
     “Acknowledgements”, and any sections Entitled “Dedications”.  You
     must delete all sections Entitled “Endorsements.”

  6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS

     You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other
     documents released under this License, and replace the individual
     copies of this License in the various documents with a single copy
     that is included in the collection, provided that you follow the
     rules of this License for verbatim copying of each of the documents
     in all other respects.

     You may extract a single document from such a collection, and
     distribute it individually under this License, provided you insert
     a copy of this License into the extracted document, and follow this
     License in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of that
     document.

  7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS

     A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other
     separate and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a
     storage or distribution medium, is called an “aggregate” if the
     copyright resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the
     legal rights of the compilation’s users beyond what the individual
     works permit.  When the Document is included in an aggregate, this
     License does not apply to the other works in the aggregate which
     are not themselves derivative works of the Document.

     If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these
     copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half
     of the entire aggregate, the Document’s Cover Texts may be placed
     on covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the
     electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic
     form.  Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket
     the whole aggregate.

  8. TRANSLATION

     Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
     distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section
     4.  Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special
     permission from their copyright holders, but you may include
     translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the
     original versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may include a
     translation of this License, and all the license notices in the
     Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also
     include the original English version of this License and the
     original versions of those notices and disclaimers.  In case of a
     disagreement between the translation and the original version of
     this License or a notice or disclaimer, the original version will
     prevail.

     If a section in the Document is Entitled “Acknowledgements”,
     “Dedications”, or “History”, the requirement (section 4) to
     Preserve its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the
     actual title.

  9. TERMINATION

     You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document
     except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
     otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute it is void,
     and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.

     However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your
     license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)
     provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and
     finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the
     copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some
     reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.

     Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
     reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
     violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
     received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from
     that copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days
     after your receipt of the notice.

     Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate
     the licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you
     under this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not
     permanently reinstated, receipt of a copy of some or all of the
     same material does not give you any rights to use it.

  10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE

     The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of
     the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.  Such new
     versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
     differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.  See
     <https://www.gnu.org/copyleft/>.

     Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version
     number.  If the Document specifies that a particular numbered
     version of this License “or any later version” applies to it, you
     have the option of following the terms and conditions either of
     that specified version or of any later version that has been
     published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.  If the
     Document does not specify a version number of this License, you may
     choose any version ever published (not as a draft) by the Free
     Software Foundation.  If the Document specifies that a proxy can
     decide which future versions of this License can be used, that
     proxy’s public statement of acceptance of a version permanently
     authorizes you to choose that version for the Document.

  11. RELICENSING

     “Massive Multiauthor Collaboration Site” (or “MMC Site”) means any
     World Wide Web server that publishes copyrightable works and also
     provides prominent facilities for anybody to edit those works.  A
     public wiki that anybody can edit is an example of such a server.
     A “Massive Multiauthor Collaboration” (or “MMC”) contained in the
     site means any set of copyrightable works thus published on the MMC
     site.

     “CC-BY-SA” means the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0
     license published by Creative Commons Corporation, a not-for-profit
     corporation with a principal place of business in San Francisco,
     California, as well as future copyleft versions of that license
     published by that same organization.

     “Incorporate” means to publish or republish a Document, in whole or
     in part, as part of another Document.

     An MMC is “eligible for relicensing” if it is licensed under this
     License, and if all works that were first published under this
     License somewhere other than this MMC, and subsequently
     incorporated in whole or in part into the MMC, (1) had no cover
     texts or invariant sections, and (2) were thus incorporated prior
     to November 1, 2008.

     The operator of an MMC Site may republish an MMC contained in the
     site under CC-BY-SA on the same site at any time before August 1,
     2009, provided the MMC is eligible for relicensing.

ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents
====================================================

To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of
the License in the document and put the following copyright and license
notices just after the title page:

     Copyright (C)  YEAR  YOUR NAME.
     Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document
     under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.3
     or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;
     with no Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover
     Texts.  A copy of the license is included in the section entitled ``GNU
     Free Documentation License''.

   If you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover
Texts, replace the “with...Texts.” line with this:

     with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with
     the Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts
     being LIST.

   If you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some other
combination of the three, merge those two alternatives to suit the
situation.

   If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we
recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of free
software license, such as the GNU General Public License, to permit
their use in free software.
