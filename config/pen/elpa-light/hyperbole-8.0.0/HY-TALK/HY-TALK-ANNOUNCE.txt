       Bring Your Text to Life the Easy Way with GNU Hyperbole

                 A talk by the author, Bob Weiner


Like Emacs itself, GNU Hyperbole is an integrated, extensible,
self-documenting, and programmable hypertextual editing environment
delivered as a single ELPA package for quick installation and
evaluation.  But where to start with such a large package?

This talk will provide a detailed, interactive overview of GNU
Hyperbole's major capabilities and how they can speed knowledge
work, including:

   1. Implicit, Explicit and Global Buttons for interlinking your
      textual information regardless of type or mode;

   2. Org Mode Integration that reduces the complexity of dealing with
      Org constructs and lets you leverage Hyperbole in Org documents;

   3. The Koutliner for rapid outlining with multi-level autonumbering
      (like legal numbering), per outline heading/cell permanent
      hyperlink anchors, and dynamic views that can be triggered by
      links themselves;
  
   4. HyRolo for fast contact or any hierarchical record management
      including Org files or normal Emacs outlines;

   5. HyControl for fast control over your Emacs windows and frames:
      interactively increase or decrease your your face sizes, adjust
      window sizes and layouts; replicate frame sizes and attributes
      precisely; show what you want where you want it.

Whatever you like about Emacs you'll likely find similar in Hyperbole.
Hyperbole grows with you as your knowledge and work complexity
increases.  An hour invested in Hyperbole has the potential to save
you hundreds of hours in your future knowledge work.  Come find out
about the magic and why its not all hyperbole.
