# Commentary:
#
#   Create the file given by the variable 'clib_list' below, and place in that
#   file the full path for each C, C++ or Objective-C library that you want
#   scanned for symbol names.  One filename per line.  Do not quote the
#   filenames.
#
#   Handles exact name matches only.  Echos and exits with same output value.
#   Either 1 if symbol is found or 0 if not.

# Code:

# Create this file and place in the file the full path for each C, C++ or
# Objective-C library that you want scanned for symbol names.  One filename
# per line.  Do not quote the filenames.

set clib_list = "~/.CLIBS-LIST"


# This file will automatically be created to cache the symbol names.
# Remove it if you ever want to rebuild the symbol table.
