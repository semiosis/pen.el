(autoload 'org-ql-select "org-ql" "\
Return items matching QUERY in BUFFERS-OR-FILES.

BUFFERS-OR-FILES is a file or buffer, a list of files and/or
buffers, or a function which returns such a list.

QUERY is an `org-ql' query sexp (quoted, since this is a
function).

ACTION is a function which is called on each matching entry with
point at the beginning of its heading.  It may be:

- `element' or nil: Equivalent to `org-element-headline-parser'.

- `element-with-markers': Equivalent to calling
  `org-element-headline-parser', with markers added using
  `org-ql--add-markers'.  Suitable for formatting with
  `org-ql-view--format-element', allowing insertion into an Org
  Agenda-like buffer.

- A sexp, which will be byte-compiled into a lambda function.

- A function symbol.

If NARROW is non-nil, buffers are not widened (the default is to
widen and search the entire buffer).

SORT is either nil, in which case items are not sorted; or one or
a list of defined `org-ql' sorting methods (`date', `deadline',
`scheduled', `closed', `todo', `priority', `reverse', or `random'); or a
user-defined comparator function that accepts two items as
arguments and returns nil or non-nil.  Sorting methods are
applied in the order given (i.e. later methods override earlier
ones), and `reverse' may be used more than once.

For example, `(date priority)' would present items with the
highest priority first, and within each priority the oldest items
would appear first.  In contrast, `(date reverse priority)' would
also present items with the highest priority first, but within
each priority the newest items would appear first.

Like `org-ql-select', but arguments are named more like a SQL query.

SELECT corresponds to the `org-ql-select' argument ACTION.  It is
the function called on matching headings, the results of which
are returned by this function.  It may be:

- `element' or nil: Equivalent to `org-element-headline-parser'.

- `element-with-markers': Equivalent to
  `org-element-headline-parser', with markers added using
  `org-ql--add-markers'.  Suitable for formatting with
  `org-ql-view--format-element', allowing insertion into an Org
  Agenda-like buffer.

FROM corresponds to the `org-ql-select' argument BUFFERS-OR-FILES.
It may be one or a list of file paths and/or buffers.

WHERE corresponds to the `org-ql-select' argument QUERY.  It
should be an `org-ql' query sexp.

ORDER-BY corresponds to the `org-ql-select' argument SORT, which
see.

NARROW corresponds to the `org-ql-select' argument NARROW.

QUERY-PREFIX may be a string to prepend to the query entered by
the user (e.g. use \"heading:\" to only search headings, easily
creating a custom command that saves the user from having to type
it).

QUERY-FILTER may be a function through which the query the user
types is filtered before execution (e.g. it could replace spaces
with commas to turn multiple tokens, which would normally be
treated as multiple predicates, into multiple arguments to a
single predicate).
