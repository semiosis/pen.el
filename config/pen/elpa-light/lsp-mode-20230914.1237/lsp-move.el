;;; Commentary:

;;; To enable lsp-move include the following lisp code in init.el after
;;; loading lsp-mode
;;;
;;;    (with-eval-after-load 'lsp-mode
;;;      (require 'move-mode)
;;;      (require 'lsp-move)
;;;      (add-hook 'move-mode-hook #'lsp)
;;;
;;; See `lsp-clients-move-analyzer-executable' to customize the path to move-analyzer.

;;; Code:
