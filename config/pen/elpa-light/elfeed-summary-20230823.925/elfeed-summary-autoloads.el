Display a feed summary for elfeed.

The feed summary is a tree of three basic items: groups, feeds and
searches.  Groups also may contain other items.  The structure of the
tree is determined by the `elfeed-summary-settings' variable.

Take a look at `elfeed-summary-mode' for the list of available
keybindings, and at the `elfeed-summary' group for the available
options." t)
