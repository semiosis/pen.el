;;; Commentary:

;; Company backend for Perl.
;; Analysis is done through PlSense located at <https://github.com/aki2o/plsense>.
;; Note that aki2o already has an Emacs autocompletion backend for autocomple.el
;; located at <https://github.com/aki2o/emacs-plsense>
;; To use this package you must download PlSense and go through the setup.
;;
;; If there are libraries your Perl code uses that are not part of @INC make
;; sure they are either part of lib-path in `company-plsense-config-path' (Note
;; that this variable can only take one path) or they are part of the $PERL5LIB
;; within the Emacs environment. If you make changes to $PERL5LIB you will need
;; to restart the PlSense server to apply the changes.
