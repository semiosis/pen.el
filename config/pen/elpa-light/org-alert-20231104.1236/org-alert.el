;;; Commentary:

;; This package provides functions to display system notifications for
;; any org-mode deadlines that are due in your agenda. To perform a
;; one-shot check call (org-alert-deadlines). To enable repeated
;; checking call (org-alert-enable) and to disable call
;; (org-alert-disable). You can set the checking interval by changing
;; the org-alert-interval variable to the number of seconds you'd
;; like.
