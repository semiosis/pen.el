;;; Commentary:
;;
;; `imenu-anywhere` provides navigation for imenu tags across all buffers that
;; satisfy grouping criteria. Available criteria include - all buffers with the
;; same major mode, same project buffers and user defined list of friendly mode
;; buffers.
;;
;; To activate, just bind `imenu-anywhere' to a convenient key:
;;
;;    (global-set-key (kbd "C-.") 'imenu-anywhere)
;;
;; By default `imenu-anywhere' uses plain `completing-read'. `ido-imenu-anywhere',
;; `ivy-imenu-anywhere' and `helm-imenu-anywhere' are specialized interfaces.
;;
;; Several filtering strategies are available - same-mode buffers, same-project
;; buffers and user defined friendly buffers. See
;; `imenu-anywhere-buffer-filter-functions' and `imenu-anywhere-friendly-modes'.
