;;; Commentary:

;; When `selected-minor-mode' is active, the keybindings in `selected-keymap'
;; will be enabled when the region is active.  This is useful for commands that
;; operates on the region, which you only want keybound when the region is
;; active.
;;
;; `selected-keymap' has no default bindings.  Bind it yourself:
;;
;; (define-key selected-keymap (kbd "u") #'upcase-region)
;;
;; You can also bind keys specific to a major mode, by creating a keymap named
;; selected-<major-mode-name>-map:
;;
;; (setq selected-org-mode-map (make-sparse-keymap))
;; (define-key selected-org-mode-map (kbd "t") #'org-table-convert-region)
;;
;; There's also a global minor mode available: `selected-global-mode' if you
;; want selected-minor-mode in all buffers.

;;; Code:

  "Keymap for `selected-minor-mode'.  Add keys here that should be active when region is active.")
