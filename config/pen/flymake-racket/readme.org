#+TITLE: Flymake Racket

[[https://melpa.org/#/flymake-racket][file:https://melpa.org/packages/flymake-racket-badge.svg]]

Flymake extension for Racket.

* Install
  #+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle yes
(use-package flymake-racket
  :ensure t
  :commands (flymake-racket-add-hook)
  :init
  (add-hook 'scheme-mode-hook #'flymake-racket-add-hook)
  (add-hook 'racket-mode-hook #'flymake-racket-add-hook))
  #+end_src

  Since I use both Emacs 25 and Emacs 26, I use flycheck-racket for Emacs 25
  and flymake-racket for Emacs 26.

  #+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle yes
  (defun +scheme-mode-setup-linting ()
    "Use `flymake' instead of `flycheck' in Emacs 26."
    (when (>= emacs-major-version 26)
      (flymake-mode)
      (flycheck-mode -1)))

  (add-hook 'scheme-mode-hook #'+scheme-mode-setup-linting)
  (add-hook 'racket-mode-hook #'+scheme-mode-setup-linting)
  #+end_src
* Differences to flycheck-racket
  - More responsive, flycheck-racket seems to stall typing while it runs
    which prompted me to write flymake-racket.
  - flycheck-racket only gives the error message and not the possible cause.
    flymake-racket explicitly looks for the possible cause: message.
