;;; Commentary:

;; This file provides commands to navigate a buffer using keywords and
;; headings provided by `navi-mode' and `outshine'.

;; navi-mode <https://github.com/tj64/navi> is a package that lets you
;; quickly navigate and "remotely control" buffers.

;; Outshine <https://github.com/tj64/outshine> is a package that lets
;; you organize your non-org-mode buffers with commented Org headings
;; and other Org features, especially useful for any kind of source
;; code, or any file format which supports comments.

;; These packages are practically developed as as single package, and
;; `navi-mode' requires `outshine', so they are supported here in a
;; single `helm-navi' package.

;;; Code:

;;;; Requirements

(require 'cl-lib)
(require 'helm-org)
(require 's)
(require 'navi-mode)

;;;; Customization

(defgroup helm-navi nil

  "Fontify results according to their appearance in source buffers.
It's unlikely that you would want to disable this, but in case it
is ever a performance issue on slow machines, you can."
  :type 'boolean)
