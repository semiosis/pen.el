Non-nil if Company-Statistics mode is enabled.
See the `company-statistics-mode' command
for a description of this minor mode.
Setting this variable directly does not take effect;
either customize it (see the info node `Easy Customization')
or call the function `company-statistics-mode'.")

(autoload 'company-statistics-mode "company-statistics" "\
Statistical sorting for company-mode.  Ranks completion candidates by
the frequency with which they have been chosen in recent (as given by
`company-statistics-size') history.

If called interactively, toggle `Company-Statistics mode'.  If
the prefix argument is positive, enable the mode, and if it is
zero or negative, disable the mode.

If called from Lisp, toggle the mode if ARG is `toggle'.  Enable
the mode if ARG is nil, omitted, or is a positive number.
Disable the mode if ARG is a negative number.

The mode's hook is called both when the mode is enabled and when
it is disabled.

Turning this mode on and off preserves the statistics.  They are also
preserved automatically between Emacs sessions in the default
configuration.  You can customize this behavior with
`company-statistics-auto-save', `company-statistics-auto-restore' and
`company-statistics-file'.
