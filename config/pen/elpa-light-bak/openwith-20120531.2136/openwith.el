;;; Commentary:

;; This lets you associate external applications with files so that
;; you can open them via C-x C-f, with RET in dired, etc.

;; Copy openwith.el to your load-path and add to your .emacs:

;;    (require 'openwith)
;;    (openwith-mode t)

;; To customize associations etc., use:

;;    M-x customize-group RET openwith RET
