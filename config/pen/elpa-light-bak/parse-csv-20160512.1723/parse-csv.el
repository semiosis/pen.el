;; Parse strings with CSV fields into s-expressions
;;
;; This file implements `parse-csv->list' and `parse-csv-string'.
;;
;; parse-csv-string is ported from Edward Marco Baringer's csv.lisp
;; http://common-lisp.net/project/bese/repos/arnesi_dev/src/csv.lisp
;; It was ported to Emacs Lisp by Matt Curtis.
;;
;; (parse-csv->list "a,b,\"c,d\"")
;;     => ("a" "b" "c,d")
;;
;; (parse-csv-string "a;b;'c;d'" ?\; ?\')
;;     => ("a" "b" "c;d")
