;;; Commentary:

;; This package provides a simple company-mode back-end for auto-completing Solidity keywords when working in solidity-mode.

;;; Code:

(require 'cl-lib)
(require 'company)

;; Additional completion targets whcih are nore part of solidty-mode syntax-highlighting keywords lists:

(defconst company-solidity-additional-math
