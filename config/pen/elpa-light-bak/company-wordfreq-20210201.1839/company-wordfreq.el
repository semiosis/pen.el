;;; Commentary:

;; `company-wordfreq' is a company backend intended for writing texts in a human
;; language.  The completions it proposes are words already used in the current
;; (or another open) buffer and matching words from a word list file.  This
;; word list file is supposed to be a simple list of words ordered by the
;; frequency the words are used in the language.  So the first completions are
;; words already used in the buffer followed by matching words of the language
;; ordered by frequency.
;;
;; `company-wordfreq' does not come with the word list files directly, but it
;; can download the files for you for many languages from
;; <https://github.com/hermitdave/FrequencyWords>.  I made a fork of that repo
;; just in case the original changes all over sudden without my noticing.
;;
;; The directory where the word list files reside is determined by the variable
;; `company-wordfreq-path', default `~/.emacs.d/wordfreq-dicts'.  Their
;; names must follow the pattern `<language>.txt' where language is the
;; `ispell-local-dictionary' value of the current language.
;;
;; You need =grep= in your =$PATH= as =company-wordfreq= uses it to grep into
;; the word list files.  Should be the case by default on any UNIX like
;; systems.  On windows you might have to tweak it somehow.
;;
;; `company-wordfreq' is supposed to be the one and only company backend and
;; `company-mode' should not transform or sort its candidates.  This can be
;; achieved by setting the variables `company-backends' and
;; `company-transformers' buffer locally in `text-mode' buffers by
;;
;;     (add-hook 'text-mode-hook (lambda ()
;;                              (setq-local company-backends '(company-wordfreq))
;;                              (setq-local company-transformers nil)))
;;
;; Usually you don't need to configure the language picked to get the word
;; completions.  `company-wordfreq' uses the variable
;; `ispell-local-dictionary'.  It should work dynamically even if you use
;; `auto-dictionary-mode'.
;;
;;
;; To download a word list use
;;
;;     M-x company-wordfreq-download-list
;;
;; You are presented a list of languages to choose.  For some languages the
;; word lists are huge, which can lead to noticeable latency when the
;; completions are build.  Therefore you are asked if you want to use a word
;; list with only the 50k most frequent words.  The file will then be
;; downloaded, processed and put in place.
