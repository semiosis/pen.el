;;; Commentary:

;; This program is an implementation of minesweeper for Emacs.  Its source repo lives at https://hg.sr.ht/~zck/minesweeper .

;; This game consists of a minefield.  There are squares with mines, and squares without mines.
;; The goal is to reveal all squares that do not have a mine.  If you reveal a mine, it explodes,
;; and the game is over!

;; To begin playing, call `M-x minesweeper`.

;; Use the arrow keys, p/b/n/f, or C-p/C-n/C-b/C-f to move around in the minefield.

;; To reveal squares, either left-click on them, or move point and press space, enter, or `x`.

;; When a square is revealed, if it is not a mine, there will be a number indicating the count of mines in the neighboring eight squares.
;; If a square with no neighboring mines is revealed, all its neighbors will also be revealed.

;; You can mark squares that you think have mines in them.  Marked squares are protected
;; from being revealed by any means.
;; To mark a square, right-click on it, or press `m`.  Marked squares can be unmarked the same way.

;; You can choose to reveal all the neighbors of a square by middle-clicking on a square, or moving point there and pressing `c`.

There's a field of squares; each square may hold a mine.
Your goal is to uncover all the squares that don't have mines.
If a revealed square doesn't have a mine, you'll see how many mines
are in the eight neighboring squares.
You may mark squares, which protects them from accidentally being revealed.
