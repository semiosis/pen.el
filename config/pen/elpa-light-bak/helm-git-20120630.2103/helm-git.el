;;; Commentary:
;;
;; Helm Git extension makes opening files from current Git repository
;; fast and easy. It uses Git binary (using magit) to get list of
;; project files so it's prety fast even for large projects with
;; thousands of files. It also takes into account .gitignore file so
;; that you only get real project files. Magit should also make it
;; usable on wide variety of OS.
;;
