* cushman-codex
We currently offer two Codex models, davinci-
codex and cushman-codex.

Davinci Codex is more capable, particularly
for translating NL to code.

Its per-request token limit is also double the
usual limit (4,096 tokens instead of 2,048)
which can improve results.

Cushman Codex is almost as capable, but
slightly faster.

This speed advantage may be preferable for
real-time applications
