defer
    An engine will not defer to a different
    engine unless a defer is specified and the
    prompt requests it.

layers
    'layers' is like 'provides' but also
    reflects how the model was trained.

    It says the layers of training /
    finetuning.
    
        layers:
        - foundation
        - nl
        - code

    The above means that it is based on a
    foundation model and may provide
    foundation features but it is also
    finetuned (nl then code), so may not be
    ideal for a foundation task.

    The layers also suggest that the engine
    provides 'nl' and 'code' knowledge if a
    prompt requires them.

foundation
    - What makes a LM a foundation LM?
      - Generality and power
    - What if a model is finetuned? Is it
      still a foundation model?
    - What if a model is just as general but
      less powerful? Is it still a foundation
      model?
    - I can specify 'foundation: true' while
      most definable tasks can be performed by
      the model.  That may change in future.

    I can specify 'foundation: true' while
    most definable tasks can be performed by
    the model.

    That may change in future when the model
    no longer performs most definable tasks,
    or if the definition of a foundation model
    changes.
