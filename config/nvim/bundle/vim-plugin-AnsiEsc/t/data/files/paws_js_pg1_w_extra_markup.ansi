The [1;39mfirst non-flag[m argument will be an operation to perform; the second depends
on the operation, but is usually a path to a file to load. If no operation is
given, then the [32mstart[39m operation is assumed.

In true [1m[31mUNIX[0m style, single-letter [47m[31mflags[39m m[30may[0m be combined serially; that is, [7m-aBc[27m
is synonymous with [7m-a -B -c[27m. Furthermore, all arguments following a bare [7m--[27m are
passed to the [46m[32mprogram [31mun-parsed [35m(that is,[0m even if it's a flag that would
otherwise be interpreted by the Paws.js CLI, it will be ignored and passed
Verbatim to the Paws program being run.)
