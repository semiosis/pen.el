                         (w/apologies to MSI)

   [1;40;32mWe hope you find this information useful.

     [1;40;37mARQ -
         [1;40;32mAwfully Repetitive Questionnaire. The questionnaire you
         have to fill in when you log onto a board for the first time
         that differs only slightly from board to board.

     [1;40;37mASCII -
         [1;40;32mAmerican Standard Code for Information Exchange.  A 7-bit binary
         code representation of letters, numbers and happy faces.

     [1;40;37mAsynchronous -
         [1;40;32mA term used by modem professionals to make themselves look
         smart and to confuse everyone else. Comare Synchronous, Parity,  
         CRC, and in fact most of the rest of this file.

     [1;40;37mAuto Answer -
         [1;40;32mThe modem feature which means you have to unplug the modem as
         well as the phone when you don't want to be disturbed.

     [1;40;37mBaud Rate -
         [1;40;32mThe variable B in the equation T=S/B, where T is time and S is  
         the size of the file you want to download.

     [1;40;37mBBS -
         [1;40;32mBulletin Board System.

     [1;40;37mBit -
         [1;40;32mA computer signal so small as to be unimportant. Like a quark.

     [1;40;37mBuffer -
         [1;40;32mThe place data goes when the host modem bites off more than it 
         can chew.

     [1;40;37mBulletin Board System -
         [1;40;32mA sure way to get rid of all that excess time and money. Many
         hermits have turned from living in the desert to running a BBS as
         their chosen form of self-discipline.

     [1;40;37mByte -
         [1;40;32mThe leftover bit at the end of all the files you download
         that don't make a complete block.

     [1;40;37mCarrier -
         [1;40;32mAn open phone line. Dropping carrier=hanging up.

     [1;40;37mConference -
         [1;40;32mAn area of public messages on a Bulletin Board System, usually
         with a particular topic. The topic serves no purpose except to give
         the conference a name, since practically nothing posted in a
         conference has anything to do with the topic.

     [1;40;37mCCITT -
         [1;40;32mA weird way of spelling "sit." What this has to do with   
         communications we haven't figured out yet.

     [1;40;37mCPS -
         [1;40;32mConferences Per Sysop. The number of conferences a sysop
         makes that people actually post in. The average CPS in Bakersfield 
         is 2.
     
     [1;40;37mCRC -
         [1;40;32mClashing Red Colors. The term for any ANSI drawing in which
         it's impossible to tell which is light red and which is dark red.

     [1;40;37mDownload -
         [1;40;32mReceiving a file from a Bulletin Board System. This is a 
         complicated process but very easy once you master it. How the
         computers actually do the download is beyond us.

     [1;40;37mDTE -
         [1;40;32mDrastically Tacky Entry. A message left by someone new to 
         computers or communications such as "HI!!!!!!!!!". This is an
         unconscious sign that they are new and need help.

     [1;40;37mDTR -
         [1;40;32mDeter, according to the Short Circuit Industries Pseudo4800 
         modem, which is actually only a 2400 but takes out all vowels in 
         order to save time.

     [1;40;37mData Compression Protocols -
         [1;40;32mExternal protocols developed by PkWare in order to be able
         to download PKWare products in half the time. Unfortunately, any
         PKWare product you may wish to download takes less time to download
         then the actual compression protocol, so they are rarely used.
     
     [1;40;37mData Transmission Protocols -
         [1;40;32mUm... protocols for transmitting data. Don't ask stupid
         questions. Right! On to the next one!

     [1;40;37mEchomail -
         [1;40;32mLocal message conferences on a Bulletin Board System, so called
         because if it were a room it would echo whenever someone posted a
         message.
     
     [1;40;37mExpanded Memory -
         [1;40;32mThe ability to remember the file you wanted to download after
         seeing the rest of the list.
     
     [1;40;37mExtended Memory -
         [1;40;32mThe ability to remember the number of the file area you want
         to list without having to list the areas.
     
     [1;40;37mFlow Control -
         [1;40;32mA conspiracy between the modem companies to build imperfections
         in some modems to make them transfer at lower speeds. This means
         that they can charge $200+ for a 14400 baud modem.

     [1;40;37mError Control Protocols -
         [1;40;32mThese are a form of virus checking that scrutinizes each
         individual block of data for a virus. Since it is very hard to
         fit a virus inside a single block and the results are very
         unreliable, this is obviously another way to slow down our modems.

     [1;40;37mFreeware -
         [1;40;32mComputer software which may be distributed on Bulletin Board
         Systems, and for which the author requests no license fee or
         registration fee. Either they were very kind or desperate for
         recognition, or the software sucks.
     
     [1;40;37mFull Duplex -
         [1;40;32mA sysop who runs a free BBS.

     [1;40;37mHalf Duplex -
         [1;40;32mThe co-sysop of a free BBS (it wasn't their idea).

     [1;40;37mHost System -
         [1;40;32mWhat the Coneheads would call a Bulletin Board System.

     [1;40;37mLocal Area Network (LAN) -
         [1;40;32m A BBS that never actually uses phone lines and allows access
         to DOS.
     
     [1;40;37mMail Door -
         [1;40;32mThe department of Sears that delivers doors to your home. 
         This also has nothing to do with communications so we have no     
         idea what it's doing in this glossary.

     [1;40;37mMNP -
         [1;40;32mMany Nutty People. The reason subscription BBSes make money.

     [1;40;37mNetmail -
         [1;40;32m Private mail that has been tampered with so as to go to a
         different individual. A mail-netting program is used by unscrupulous
         sysops to read their users' private mail without informing them of
         it.
        
     [1;40;37mNRAM -
         [1;40;32mNot Really Allocated Money. Embezzled funds. Where most of the
         donations to BBSes come from.
     
     [1;40;37mON/OFF Hook -
         [1;40;32m The practice of putting a fake hook on your hand and flipping
         the ON/OFF switch on your computer rapidly with it while shouting, 
         "I'll get ye, Peter Pan!"

     [1;40;37mPacker -
         [1;40;32m A BBS caller who has resorted to low-paying jobs such as work in
         a packing shed in order to afford subscription BBSes.

     [1;40;37mPacket -
         [1;40;32m What a packer hears 32,767 times a day.

     [1;40;37mParity -
         [1;40;32m This file.

     [1;40;37mProtocol -
         [1;40;32m A set of rules used by both the host and remote computer in
         order to avoid a fight between the two modems. This is especially
         important when two modems from different companies are connected.     
         
     [1;40;37mPublic Domain -
         [1;40;32mSoftware that anyone can screw up, not just the author.

         [1;40;32mA conference on which NOBODY ever posts.

     [1;40;37mShareware -
         [1;40;32mSoftware that can be distributed to other people. You're supposed
         to send them money if you like it but nobody ever does.

     [1;40;37mSysOp -
         [1;40;32mThe operator of a Bulletin Board System. Sufficient proof for
         legal insanity in most states.

     [1;40;37mThread -
         [1;40;32mWhat most BBSes are held together with.

     [1;40;37mUnpacker -
         [1;40;32mSomeone who was born rich and can afford all those subscription
         BBSes. They occasionally go out in the fields and enrage the packers.

     [1;40;37mUpload -
         [1;40;32mSending a file to a BBS instead of recieving one. Usually only
         practiced by sysops.
